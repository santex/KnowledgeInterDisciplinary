The related API Cocoa Touch includes\ngesture recognition, animation, and a different user interface library, and is\nfor applications for the iOS operating system, used on Apple devices such as the\niPhone, the iPod Touch, and the iPad.\n\nCocoa consists of the Foundation Kit, Application Kit, and Core Data frameworks,\nas included by Cocoa.h header file, as well as the libraries and\nframeworks included by those, such as the C standard library and the Objective-C\nruntime. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conc-\neptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemFrameworks/SystemFrameworks.html\n\nCocoa applications are typically developed using the development tools provided\nby Apple, specifically Xcode (formerly Project Builder) and Interface Builder,\nusing the Objective-C language. However, the Cocoa programming environment can\nbe accessed using other tools, such as Clozure CL, LispWorks, Object Pascal,\nPython, Perl, Ruby, and AppleScript with the aid of bridging mechanisms such as\nPasCocoa, PyObjC, CamelBones, RubyCocoa and [http://michelf.com/weblog/2007/d-objc-\nbridge/ D/Objective-C Bridge]. An implementation of the Ruby language, called\nMacRuby, which does away with the requirement for a bridging mechanism, is under\ndevelopment by Apple, while Nu is a Lisp-like language that can be used with\nCocoa without a bridge. It is also possible to write Objective-C Cocoa programs\nin a simple text editor and build it manually with GCC or clang from the command\nline or from a makefile.\n\nFor end-users, Cocoa applications are those written using the Cocoa programming\nenvironment. Such applications usually have a distinctive feel, since the Cocoa\nprogramming environment automates many aspects of an application to comply with\nApple's human interface guidelines.\n","linknr":550,"url":"Cocoa_(API)","recorded":1362580543,"links":30,"instances":["computer_science","programming_language","typography","programming","data_structure","computer_science","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","apple","programming_language","api","economics","graphics_layer","operating_system"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mac OS X APIs"],"headings":["Cocoa history","Memory management","Main frameworks","Model-view-controller","Late binding","Rich objects","Implementations and Bindings","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ios","apple"],["python","programming_language"],["ruby","programming_language"],["nu","programming_language"],["lisp","programming_language"],["end-user","computer_science"],["rhapsody","operating_system"],["quartz","graphics_layer"],["rationalization","economics"],["library","computer_science"],["string","computer_science"],["container","data_structure"],["constant","programming"],["quartz","graphics_layer"],["string","computer_science"],["ligature","typography"],["textedit","api"],["python","programming_language"],["ruby","programming_language"],["c_sharp","programming_language"],["nu","programming_language"]],"members":["python","ligature","constant","container","string","library","ruby","lisp","nu","ios","c_sharp","textedit","rationalization","quartz","rhapsody"],"related":["Apple_Inc.","Objective-C","Mac_OS_X","Software_framework","Proprietary_software","Apple_Inc.","Application_programming_interface","Mac_OS_X","Operating_system","Cocoa_Touch","Gesture_recognition","Animation","Widget_engine","Application_software","IOS_(Apple)","IPhone","IPod_Touch","IPad","Xcode","Project_Builder","Interface_Builder","Objective-C","Clozure_CL","LispWorks","Object_Pascal","Python_(programming_language)","Perl","Ruby_(programming_language)","AppleScript","Language_binding","PasCocoa","PyObjC","CamelBones","RubyCocoa","MacRuby","Nu_(programming_language)","Lisp_(programming_language)","Text_editor","GNU_Compiler_Collection","Clang","Makefile","End-user_(computer_science)","Application_software","Human_interface_guidelines","NeXTSTEP","OpenStep","NeXT","Rhapsody_(operating_system)","Mac_OS","Display_PostScript","Quartz_(graphics_layer)","Portable_Document_Format","HTML","Berkeley_sockets","Stagecast_Creator","Rationalization_(economics)","Steve_Jobs","Trademark","Reference_counting","Reference_counting","No-op","IOS","LLVM","Automatic_Reference_Counting","Objective-C","Library_(computer_science)","Application_bundle","Core_Foundation","String_(computer_science)","Container_(data_structure)","Iteration","Distributed_computing","Event_loop","Constant_(programming)","Sun","Graphical_user_interface","Portable_Document_Format","Quartz_(graphics_layer)","PostScript","Smalltalk","Xerox_PARC","Model-view-controller","Cocoa_Bindings","Key-Value_Observing","Key-Value_Binding","Core_Data","Chain-of-responsibility_pattern","Unicode","String_(computer_science)","Typography","Kerning","Ligature_(typography)","Shape","Rotation","Spatial_anti-aliasing","Glyph","Ruler","Microsoft","TextEdit_(API)","Objective-C","Language_binding","Clozure_CL","LispWorks","PyObjC","Python_(programming_language)","RubyCocoa","Ruby_(programming_language)","CamelBones","Perl","Cocoa_Sharp","Monobjc","C_Sharp_(programming_language)","NObjective","Nu_(programming_language)","Objective-C","Microsoft_Windows","GNUstep","Aaron_Hillegass","Stephen_Kochan","Michael_Beam","James_Duncan_Davidson","Erick_Tejkowski","Simson_Garfinkel","Michael_K._Mahoney","Paris_Buttfield-Addison","Jon_Manning","Scott_Anguish","Erik_M._Buck","Donald_A._Yacktman","Bill_Cheeseman"]}
