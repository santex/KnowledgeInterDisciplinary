For small\nfootbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large cantilever\nbridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from\nstructural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel\ntruss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into\npractice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed\nat difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.\n",
