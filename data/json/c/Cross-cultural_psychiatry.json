{"cursor":"9323","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cross-cultural psychiatry' or transcultural psychiatry is a branch of\npsychiatry concerned with the cultural and ethnic context of mental disorders\nand psychiatric services. It emerged as a coherent field from several strands of\nwork, including surveys of the prevalence and form of disorders in different\ncultures or countries; the study of migrant populations and ethnic diversity\nwithin countries; and analysis of psychiatry itself as a cultural product. The\nearly literature was associated with colonialism and with observations by asylum\npsychiatrists or anthropologists who tended to assume the universal\napplicability of Western psychiatric diagnostic categories. A seminal paper by\nArthur Kleinman in 1977 followed by a renewed dialogue between\nanthropology and psychiatry, is seen as having heralded a \"new cross-cultural\npsychiatry\". However, Kleinman later pointed out that culture often became\nincorporated in only superficial ways, and that for example 90% of DSM-IV\ncategories are culture-bound to North America and Western Europe, and yet the\n\"culture-bound syndrome\" label is only applied to \"exotic\" conditions outside\nEuro-American society.\n\nIt is argued that a cultural perspective can help psychiatrists become aware of\nthe hidden assumptions and limitations of current psychiatric theory and\npractice and can identify new approaches appropriate for treating the\nincreasingly diverse populations seen in psychiatric services around the\nworld.\n\nThe field has, ironically, increasingly had to address the process of\nglobalization.\n\nIt is said every city has a different culture and that the urban environment,\nand how people adapt or struggle to adapt to it, can play a crucial role in the\nonset or worsening of mental illness.\n\nCross-cultural psychiatry looks at whether psychiatric classifications of\ndisorders are appropriate to different cultures or ethnic groups. It often\nargues that psychiatric illnesses represent social constructs as well as genuine\nmedical conditions, and as such have social uses peculiar to the social groups\nin which they are created and legitimized. It studies psychiatric\nclassifications in different cultures, whether informal (e.g. category terms\nused in different languages) or formal (for example the World Health\nOrganization's ICD, the American Psychiatric Association's DSM, or the Chinese\nSociety of Psychiatry's CCMD.[http://www.cma-\nmh.org/english/articlecontent.asp?articleId=27556]\n\nHowever, some scholars consider that culture is not enough if decontextualized\nfrom historical events, and History in more general sense. A hystorical and\npolitically informed perspective could prevent from hegemonic risks related to\n'global mental health' programs as well as from the increasing hegemony of\ndiagnostic categories such as PTSD (Didier Fassin, Richard Rechhtman analize\nthis issue in their book on the 'empire of trauma'). Roberto Beneduce, who\ndevoted many years to the research and clinical practice in West Africa (Mali,\namong the Dogon) and in Italy with migrants, strongly emphasizes this shift.\nInspired by the thought of Frantz Fanon, Beneduce points out in his recent books\nto forms of historical consciousness, historical Self and History-related\nsuffering as central dimensions of a 'critical ethnopsychiatry' or 'critical trans-\ncultural psychiatry' (Etnopsichiatria. Sofferenza mentale e alteritÃ  fra Storia,\ndominio e cultura, Rome, Carocci, 2007 AND Archeologie del Trauma.\nUn'antropologia del sottosuolo, Rome-Bari, Laterza, 2010).\n\nAs a named field within the larger discipline of psychiatry, cultural psychiatry\nhas a relatively short history. In 1955, a program in transcultural\npsychiatry was established at McGill University in Montreal by Eric Wittkower\nfrom psychiatry and Jacob Fried from the department of anthropology. In 1957, at\nthe International Psychiatric Congress in Zurich, Wittkower organized a meeting\nthat was attended by psychiatrists from 20 countries, including many who became\nmajor contributors to the field of cultural psychiatry: Tsung-Yi Lin (Taiwan),\nThomas Lambo (Nigeria), Morris Carstairs (Britain), Carlos Alberto Seguin (Peru)\nand Pow-Meng Yap (Hong Kong). The American Psychiatric Association established a\nCommittee on Transcultural Psychiatry in 1964, followed by the Canadian\nPsychiatric Association in 1967. H.B.M. Murphy of McGill founded the World\nPsychiatric Association Section on Transcultural Psychiatry in 1970. By the mid-\n1970s there were active transcultural psychiatry societies in England, France,\nItaly and Cuba. There are several scientific journals devoted to cross-cultural\nissues: Transcultural Psychiatry http://tps.sagepub.com/ (est. 1956,\noriginally as Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review, and now the official\njournal of the WPA Section on Transcultural Psychiatry), Psychopathologie\nAfricaine (1965), Culture Medicine & Psychiatry (1977), Curare (1978), and World\nCultural Psychiatry Research Review (2006). The Foundation for Psychocultural\nResearch at UCLA http://www.thefpr.org has published an important\nvolume on psychocultural aspects of trauma http://www.cambridge.org/us/cata-\nlogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521854288 and most recently the landmark volume\nentitled Formative Experiences: the Interaction of Caregiving, Culture, and\nDevelopmental Psychobiology edited by Carol Worthman, Paul Plotsky, Daniel\nSchechter, and Constance Cummings. http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/ca-\ntalogue.asp?isbn=9780521895033 The main professional organizations devoted\nto the field are the World Psychiatric Association Section on Transcultural\nPsychiatry, the Society for the Study of Psychiatry and Culture, and the World\nAssociation for Cultural Psychiatry. Many other mental health organizations have\ninterest groups or sections devoted to issues of culture and mental health.\n\nThere are active research and training programs in cultural psychiatry at\nseveral academic centers around the world, notably McGill\nUniversity, http://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych Harvard University, the\nUniversity of Toronto, and University College London. Other organizations are\ndevoted to cross-cultural adaptation of research and clinical methods. In 1993\nthe Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) was founded. The TPO has come\nup with a system of intervention aimed at countries with little or no mental\nhealth care. They train locals to become mental health workers, often using\npeople who previously have provided mental health guidance of some kind. The TPO\nprovides training material that is adapted to local culture, language and\ndistinct traumatic events that might have occurred in the region where the\norganization is operating. Avoiding Western approaches to mental health; the TPO\nsets up what becomes a local non-governmental organization that is self-\nsustainable, as well as economically and politically independent of any state.\nThe TPO projects have been successful in both Uganda and Cambodia.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Cross-cultural_psychiatry","recorded":1374963295,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cross-cultural_psychiatry&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cross-cultural_psychiatry&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Medical_anthropology","/wiki/Medical_anthropology","/wiki/Psychological_anthropology","/wiki/Health","/wiki/Culture-bound_syndrome","/wiki/Double_bind","/wiki/Navajo_medicine","/wiki/Nutritional_anthropology","/wiki/Psychological_anthropology","/wiki/Cognitive_anthropology","/wiki/Transpersonal_anthropology","/wiki/Ethnomedicine","/wiki/Clinical_ethnography","/wiki/Critical_medical_anthropology","/wiki/Person-centered_ethnography","/wiki/Society_for_Medical_Anthropology","/wiki/National_character_studies","/wiki/Syndemic","/wiki/Gregory_Bateson","/wiki/Maurice_Bloch","/wiki/Charles_L._Briggs","/wiki/Veena_Das","/wiki/George_Devereux","/wiki/Cora_DuBois","/wiki/Paul_Farmer","/wiki/Michael_M._J._Fischer","/wiki/Arthur_Kleinman","/wiki/Charles_Laughlin","/wiki/Robert_I._Levy","/wiki/Ralph_Linton","/wiki/Tanya_Luhrmann","/wiki/Marvin_Opler","/wiki/Michelle_Rosaldo","/wiki/Nancy_Scheper-Hughes","/wiki/Richard_Shweder","/wiki/Merrill_Singer","/wiki/Dan_Sperber","/wiki/Melford_Spiro","/wiki/Beatrice_Blyth_Whiting","/wiki/John_Whiting_(anthropologist)","/wiki/Culture,_Medicine_and_Psychiatry","/wiki/Medical_Anthropology_Quarterly","/wiki/Anthropology_of_Consciousness","/wiki/Social_anthropology","/wiki/Cultural_anthropology","/wiki/Template:Medical_anthropology","/wiki/Template_talk:Medical_anthropology","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Medical_anthropology&action=edit","/wiki/Psychiatry","/wiki/Cultural","/wiki/Ethnic","/wiki/Mental_disorder","/wiki/Prevalence","/wiki/Immigrant","/wiki/Colonialism","/wiki/Arthur_Kleinman","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Anthropology","/wiki/Culture-bound_syndrome","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Globalization","#cite_note-5","/wiki/ICD","/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association","/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","/wiki/Chinese_Society_of_Psychiatry","/wiki/CCMD","http://www.cma-mh.org/english/articlecontent.asp?articleId=27556","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/The_Foundation_for_Psychocultural_Research","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Cross-cultural_psychiatry&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Culture-bound_syndrome","/wiki/Medical_anthropology","/w/index.php?title=Cross-cultural_psychiatry&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0037-7856%2877%2990138-X","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/887955","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.3109%2F10673229709030563","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9385013","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10900523","#cite_ref-4","http://tps.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F1363461506061761","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16671396","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0193-953X%2805%2970249-5","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11593865","#cite_ref-6","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0193-953X%2805%2970238-0","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11593854","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-521-85653-1","#cite_ref-8","http://tps.sagepub.com/","#cite_ref-9","http://www.thefpr.org","#cite_ref-10","http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521854288","#cite_ref-11","http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521895033","#cite_ref-12","http://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych","/wiki/Template:Psychiatry","/wiki/Template_talk:Psychiatry","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Psychiatry&action=edit","/wiki/Psychiatry","/wiki/Portal:Psychiatry","/wiki/Addiction_psychiatry","/wiki/Biological_psychiatry","/wiki/Child_and_adolescent_psychiatry","/wiki/Developmental_disability","/wiki/E
