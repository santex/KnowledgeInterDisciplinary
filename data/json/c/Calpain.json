Calpains constitute the C2 family of protease clan CA in\nthe MEROPS database. The calpain proteolytic system includes the calpain\nproteases, the small regulatory subunit CAPNS1, also known as CAPN4, and the\nendogenous calpain-specific inhibitor, calpastatin.\n","linknr":645,"url":"Calpain","recorded":1362484457,"links":18,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes","Peptidase","Protein families"],"headings":["Discovery","Cleavage specificity","Extended family","Function","Clinical significance","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/PDB_1mdw_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1mdw_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["tissue","cell"],"related":["Calcium","Lysosome","Cysteine","Protease","Proteolytic","Enzyme","MEROPS","CAPNS1","Calpastatin","Brain","Lens_of_the_eye","Tissue_(biology)","Skeletal_muscle","Lysosome","PH","Cathepsin","Proteolysis","Calmodulin","Papaya","Papain","Millimole","Protein_dimer","CAPNS1","CAPN1","CAPN2","Amino_acid","Tertiary_structure","Primary_structure","Peptide","Hydrophobic","Leucine","Valine","Isoleucine","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Fluorogenic","EDANS","DABCYL","Isoform","Splice_variant","MEROPS","CAPN1","CAPN2","CAPN3","CAPN5","CAPN6","CAPN7","CAPN8","CAPN9","CAPN10","CAPN11","CAPN12","CAPN13","CAPN14","SOLH","CAPNS1","CAPNS2","Cell_motility","Cell_cycle","Long-term_potentiation","Neuron","Cell_fusion","Myoblast","Catalyst","Cell_(biology)","Clotting","Blood_vessel","Memory","Apoptosis","Necrosis","Cell_body","Dendrite","Neuron","Axon","Glial_cell","Calcium_in_biology","Cerebrovascular_accident","Ischemic_cascade","Traumatic_brain_injury","Diffuse_axonal_injury","Cytoskeleton","Spectrin","Microtubule","Microtubule-associated_protein","Neurofilament","Ion_channel","Cell_adhesion_molecule","Cell_surface_receptors","Plasma_membrane","Sodium_channel","Sodium","Neuron","Depolarization","Cardiac_contractile_dysfunction","AK275","MDL28170","The_Proteolysis_Map","The_Proteolysis_Map"]}
