{"cursor":"73188","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Clinical psychology' is an integration of science, theory and clinical\nknowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-\nbased distress or dysfunction and to promote subjective well-being and personal\ndevelopment. Central to its\npractice are psychological assessment and psychotherapy, although clinical\npsychologists also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic\ntestimony, and program development and administration.\nIn many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated mental health profession.\n\nThe field is often considered to have begun in 1896 with the opening of the\nfirst psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania by Lightner Witmer.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, clinical psychology was focused on\npsychological assessment, with little attention given to treatment. This changed\nafter the 1940s when World War II resulted in the need for a large increase in\nthe number of trained clinicians. Since that time, two main educational models\nhave developedâthe Ph.D. scientistâpractitioner model (requiring a doctoral\ndissertation and therefore research as well as clinical expertise); and the\nPsy.D. practitionerâscholar model.\n\nClinical psychologists are now considered experts in providing psychotherapy,\npsychological testing, and in diagnosing mental illness. They generally train\nwithin four primary theoretical orientationsâpsychodynamic, humanistic, behavior\ntherapy/cognitive behavioral, and systems or family therapy. Many continue\nclinical training in post-doctoral programs in which they might specialize more\nintensively in disciplines such as psychoanalytic approaches, or child and\nadolescent treatment modalities.\n","linknr":1153,"url":"Clinical_psychology","recorded":1362479217,"links":95,"instances":["psychometric","psychology","psychology","psychology","psychometric","psychologist","psychologist","neuropsychology","psychology","religion"],"pdf":["http://www.deakin.edu.au/hmnbs/psychology/pdf-docs/pathways-melb.pdf","http://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/code_of_ethics_and_conduct.pdf","http://www.bps.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/code_of_ethics_and_conduct.pdf","http://nurse-practitioners.advanceweb.com/resources/np010106_p34table4.pdf","http://www.ispn-psych.org/docs/11-01prescriptive-authority.pdf","http://www.ispn-psych.org/docs/11-01prescriptive-authority.pdf"],"categories":["Clinical
