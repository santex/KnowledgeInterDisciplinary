Curry, O.\n\"[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/441/1/curryphd.pdf Morality as natural history].\"\nUniversity of London Ph.D. Thesis. 2005. Accessed 2009-06-08. This\ncleaning symbiosis is an example of mutualism, an ecological interaction that\nbenefits both parties involved, though cleaning may grade into parasitism.\n\nA wide variety of fishes have been observed to display cleaning behaviors\nincluding wrasses, cichlids, catfish, and gobies, as well as by a number of\ndifferent species of cleaner shrimp. By convergent evolution, different species\nof cleaner fish often resemble each other. There is also at least one predatory\nmimic, the sabre-toothed blenny, that mimics cleaner fish but in fact feeds on\nhealthy scales and mucus.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Cleaner_fish","recorded":1362509144,"links":28,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/441/1/curryphd.pdf","http://www.ufrgs.br/ni/vol1num2/1(2)scientificnotes_02.pdf","http://www.ufrgs.br/ni/vol1num2/1(2)scientificnotes_02.pdf","http://www.opwall.com/Library/Opwall%20library%20pdfs/Journal%20publications/stummer%20size%20and%20stripes.pdf","http://www.opwall.com/Library/Opwall%20library%20pdfs/Journal%20publications/stummer%20size%20and%20stripes.pdf"],"categories":["Blenniidae","Cichlidae","Ecology","Fishkeeping","Gobiidae","Labridae","Symbiosis"],"headings":["Diversity of cleaner fish","Mimicry","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Epinephelus_tukula_is_cleaned_by_two_Labroides_dimidiatus.jpg/200px-Epinephelus_tukula_is_cleaned_by_two_Labroides_dimidiatus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Arothron_hispidus_is_being_cleaned_by_Hawaiian_cleaner_wrasses%2C_Labroides_phthirophagus_1.jpg/300px-Arothron_hispidus_is_being_cleaned_by_Hawaiian_cleaner_wrasses%2C_Labroides_phthirophagus_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Elacatinus_evelynae.jpg/250px-Elacatinus_evelynae.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Antennarius_striatus.jpg/140px-Antennarius_striatus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutualism","biology"]],"members":["mutualism"],"related":["Grouper","Fish","Skin","Ectoparasite","Cleaning_symbiosis","Mutualism_(biology)","Parasitism","Wrasse","Cichlid","Catfish","Goby","Cleaner_shrimp","Convergent_evolution","Aggressive_mimicry","Sabre-toothed_blenny","Lepidophage","Bluestreak_cleaner_wrasse","Bluestreak_cleaner_wrasse","Indian_Ocean","Pacific_Ocean","Cleaning_stations","Goby","Atlantic_Ocean","Convergent_evolution","Caribbean_cleaning_goby","Ectoparasite","Symbiosis","Brackish_water","Cichlidae","South_Asia","Striped_Raphael_catfish","Hoplias_malabaricus","Convergent_evolution","Sabre-toothed_blenny","Blenny","Aggressive_mimicry","Doctor_fish","Reciprocal_altruism","Social_grooming","Acanthuridae","Scalpel"]}
