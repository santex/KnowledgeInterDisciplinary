{"cursor":"10218","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'lithotroph' is an organism that uses an inorganic substrate (usually of\nmineral origin) to obtain reducing equivalents for use in biosynthesis (e.g.,\ncarbon dioxide fixation) or energy conservation via aerobic or anaerobic respir-\nation. http://faculty.weber.edu/mzwolinski/IntroMicro/1113Units/Unit%203/Li-\ntotrophs%20and%20Phototrophs.pdf Known chemolithotrophs are exclusively\nmicrobes; no known macrofauna possesses the ability to utilize inorganic\ncompounds as energy sources. Macrofauna and lithotrophs can form symbiotic\nrelationships, in which case the lithotrophs are called \"prokaryotic symbionts\".\nAn example of this is chemolithotrophic bacteria in deep sea worms or plastids,\nwhich are organelles within plant cells that may have evolved from\nphotolithotrophic cyanobacteria-like organisms. Lithotrophs belong to either the\ndomain Bacteria or the domain Archaea. The term \"lithotroph\" was created from\nthe Greek terms 'lithos' (rock) and 'troph' (consumer), meaning \"eaters of\nrock\". Many lithoautotrophs are extremophiles, but this is not universally so.\n\nDifferent from a lithotroph is an organotroph, an organism which gets its\nreducing agents from the catabolism of organic compounds.\n","linknr":541,"url":"Chemolithotrophy","recorded":1362505903,"links":33,"instances":["phylum","biology"],"pdf":["http://faculty.weber.edu/mzwolinski/IntroMicro/1113Units/Unit%203/Litotrophs%20and%20Phototrophs.pdf"],"categories":["Soil biology","Metabolism","Microbiology"],"headings":["Biochemistry","Geological significance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["chloroflexi","phylum"]],"members":["chloroflexi","cell"],"related":["Organism","Inorganic","Biosynthesis","Energy","Cellular_respiration","Microbe","Fauna","Deep_sea_worms","Plastids","Bacteria","Archaea","Extremophiles","Organotroph","Catabolism","Redox","Chemical_compounds","Electron","Electron_donor","Cell_(biology)","Adenosine_triphosphate","Oxygen","Aerobic_organism","Organic_compound","Species","Iron_bacteria","Ferrous","Ferric","Nitrosifying_bacteria","Ammonia","Nitrite","Nitrifying_bacteria","Nitrate","Purple_sulfur_bacteria","Halothiobacillaceae","Sulfide","Sulfur","Sulfur-oxidizing_bacteria","Rhodobacteraceae","Thiotrichaceae","Sulfur","Sulfate","Aerobic_organism","Hydrogen_bacteria","Hydrogen","Water","Anammox","Planctomycetes","Ammonia","Sulfur","Sulfate-reducing_bacteria","Hydrogen_bacteria","Hydrogen","Water","Sulfate-reducing_bacteria","Phosphite_bacteria","Phosphite","Phosphate","Methanogens","Archaea","Hydrogen","Water","Carbon_dioxide","Carboxydotrophic_bacteria","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_dioxide","Carbon","Carbon_dioxide","Carbon_dioxide","Air","Plant","Light","Photosynthesis","Photolithotrophic_bacteria","Purple_bacteria","Chromatiaceae","Chlorobiaceae","Chloroflexi_(phylum)","Cyanobacteria","Biogeochemical","Sulfur","Nitrogen","Chemical_element","Endolith","Acid_mine_drainage","Pyrite","Sulfuric_acid","Organotroph","Endolith"]}
