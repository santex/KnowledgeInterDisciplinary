Born in Bienville in Bienville Parish in north Louisiana,\nHennigan grew up in nearby Minden, the seat of Webster Parish, located thirty\nmiles east of Shreveport. His father, Clarence Roland Hennigan (1905â1992), was\nstill a sheriff's deputy when he died at the age of eighty-seven.\n\nHis mother, Lura E. Hennigan (1916â1997), was a Pentecostal minister, piano\nteacher, and artist. She wrote a regular column entitled \"The Abundant Life\" for\nthe [[Minden Press-Herald]]. \"Lura Hennigan: Sacrifice of Thanksgiving\",\n[[Minden Press-Herald]], November 16, 1984, p. 5\n\nHennigan graduated in 1953 from Minden High School, where he excelled in\nfootball, basketball, and track as well as academics.\n\nMinden, a small city, produced other successful athletes too, including David\nAllen Lee (born 1943), the punter for the Baltimore Colts from 1966â1978, and\nFred Haynes (1946â2006), the holder of many football records as the quarterback\nat Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge during the late 1960s.\n\nHennigan attended LSU on a track scholarship but wanted to play football. He\ntherefore transferred to Northwestern State University (then Northwestern State\nCollege) in Natchitoches, where he became the star of the team. In 1960, he\njoined the American Football League's Houston Oilers in the team's first year of\noperation. Prior to joining the Oilers, he had taught high school biology at a\nsalary of some $2,700 per year. He kept his teacher pay stub in his helmet to\nremind him that he must succeed in pro athletes.\n\nHennigan scored the first touchdown in Oilers history. After a promising rookie\nseason, in 1961 he started all 14 games and established himself as a superstar\nin the AFL by gaining 1,746 yards receiving, a pro-football record that stood\nfor 34 years. One of quarterback George Blandaâs main targets, Hennigan was the\nsecond professional football player to catch more than a hundred passes in a\nsingle season (101 in 1964) and to twice gain over 1,500 yards receiving (1961\nand 1964). He holds the all-time records for most games in a season with over\n200 yards receiving with three, and most games in a season with over 100 yards\nreceiving with 11. Hennigan had the All-time AFL single game record of 272 yards\nreceiving, against the Boston Patriots on October 13, 1961.\n\nHennigan was selected by his peers as a Sporting News AFL All-League offensive\nend in 1961, 1962, and 1964. He was an American Football League Eastern Division\nAll-Star five straight years (1961 - 1965), and retired after the 1966 season.\nHe was selected to the All-Time All-AFL Second Team.\n\nHall of Famer Willie Brown was originally signed by the Oilers in 1963, but was\ncut during training camp. On the 2009 Showtime series [[Full Color Football: The\nHistory of the American Football League]], George Blanda tells this story:\n\"Willie couldn't cover Charley Hennigan in practice, so he was let go, and the\nBroncos picked him up. The next year we played Denver, and Charley needed nine\ncatches to break [[Lionel Taylor]]'s record of 100 receptions in a season.\nCharley got the nine he needed, with Willie covering him. Willie's in the Hall\nof Fame. Charley Hennigan should be, too.\"\n\nOn January 19, 1962, Minden observed \"Charlie Hennigan\" Day. Then State Senator\nHarold Montgomery, State Representative, Parey Branton, Mayor Frank T. Norman,\nand other local officials presented Hennigan with a signed document of his\naccomplishments. A luncheon and evening meal were served in his\nhonor. \"Hero's Welcome Given Local Pro Grid Athlete\", Minden Press, January\n22, 1962, p. 1\n\nIn 1967, Hennigan received his doctorate in education from the University of\nHouston. \"Charles Henningan to Get Doctor's Degree\", Minden Press-Herald,\nJune 2, 1967 Hennigan operates an educational tutoring service in\nShreveport and works with prisoners seeking the General Equivalency Diploma\n(GED). Hennigan has seven children, the oldest being Charles, Jr., who was born\nin Natchitoches in 1957.\n\nOn April 6, 2002, Hennigan, a Democrat, ran in a special election for Place 8 on\nthe Caddo Parish Commission, his parish's governing body. He was defeated by\nRepublican Michael Long. Long obtained 2,139 votes (74.9 percent) to Hennigan's\n716 ballots (25.1 percent).\n","linknr":275,"url":"Charlie_Hennigan","recorded":1375056771,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Hennigan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Hennigan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Bienville,_Louisiana","/wiki/Bienville_Parish","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Wide_Receiver","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/Northwestern_State_University","/wiki/American_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/1960_American_Football_League_Draft#Round_:_First_selection","/wiki/Sporting_News","/wiki/1961_American_Football_League_All-League_Players","/w/index.php?title=1962_American_Football_League_All-League_Players&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=1964_American_Football_League_All-League_Players&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/American_Football_League_All-Star_game","/wiki/1961_American_Football_League_All-League_Players","/wiki/List_of_National_Football_League_records_(individual)","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/HennCh00.htm","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HENNICHA01","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Houston_Oilers","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Houston_Oilers","/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana","/wiki/Louisiana","/wiki/Bienville,_Louisiana","/wiki/Bienville_Parish","/wiki/Minden,_Louisiana","/wiki/Webster_Parish","/wiki/Pentecostal","/wiki/Piano","/wiki/Minden_Press-Herald","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Minden_High_School_(Minden,_Louisiana)","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Track_and_field","/wiki/David_Lee_(Baltimore_Colts)","/wiki/History_of_the_Indianapolis_Colts","/wiki/Fred_Haynes","/wiki/Louisiana_State_University","/wiki/Baton_Rouge","/wiki/Northwestern_State_University","/wiki/Natchitoches,_Louisiana","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Biology","/wiki/George_Blanda","/wiki/Boston_Patriots","/wiki/Sporting_News","/wiki/1961_American_Football_League_All-League_Players","/wiki/American_Football_League_All-Star_games","/wiki/American_Football_League_All-Time_Team","/wiki/Willie_Brown_(American_football)","/wiki/Full_Color_Football:_The_History_of_the_American_Football_League","/wiki/George_Blanda","/wiki/Lionel_Taylor","/wiki/Louisiana_State_Legislature","/wiki/Harold_Montgomery","/wiki/Louisiana_State_Legislature","/wiki/Parey_Branton","/wiki/Mayor","/wiki/Frank_T._Norman","#cite_note-2","/wiki/University_of_Houston","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Special_election","/wiki/Caddo_Parish","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Hennigan&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_American_Football_League_players","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Hennigan&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Minden_Press-Herald","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Hennigan&action=edit&section=3","http://www.henniganforthehall.com","http://www.mindenmemories.org/Charles%20Hennigan.htm","http://www.remembertheafl.com/1965ToppsOilers.htm#CharlieHennigan","http://www.caddoclerk.com/results_040602.htm","http://www.mindenmemories.com/Fifties%20Minden%20High%20School%20Grigs.htm","http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFLStandardPlayersContract.htm","/wiki/Elroy_Hirsch","/wiki/Jerry_Rice","/wiki/Template:1960_Houston_Oilers","/wiki/Template_talk:1960_Houston_Oilers","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1960_Houston_Oilers&action=edit","/wiki/Tennessee_Titans","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Dalva_Allen","/wiki/Jack_Atchason","/wiki/Tony_Banfield","/wiki/George_Belotti","/wiki/George_Blanda","/wiki/Don_Brown_(American_football_player)","/wiki/Billy_Cannon","/wiki/Johnny_Carson_(American_football)","/wiki/Doug_Cline","/w/index.php?title=Pete_Davidson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mike_Dukes","/wiki/Don_Floyd","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Gordon_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Gabby_Greaves&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bill_Groman","/wiki/Kenneth_Hall_(American_football)","/wiki/Jerry_Helluin","/wiki/Al_Jamison","/wiki/Mark_Johnston_(American_football)","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Kendall&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Dan_Lanphear","/wiki/Jacky_Lee","/wiki/Wahoo_McDaniel","/wiki/Rich_Michael","/wiki/Charlie_Milstead","/wiki/Dennit_Morris","/wiki/Jim_Norton_(safety)","/w
