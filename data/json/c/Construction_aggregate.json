{"cursor":"16278","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]]\n\n\n\n'Construction aggregate', or simply \"[[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]\", is a\nbroad category of coarse particulate material used in construction, including\nsand, gravel, crushed stone, slag, recycled concrete and geosynthetic\naggregates. Aggregates are the most mined material in the world. Aggregates are\na component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete; the\naggregate serves as reinforcement to add strength to the overall composite\nmaterial. Due to the relatively high hydraulic conductivity value as compared to\nmost soils, aggregates are widely used in drainage applications such as\nfoundation and French drains, septic drain fields, retaining wall drains, and\nroad side edge drains. Aggregates are also used as base material under\nfoundations, roads, and railroads. In other words, aggregates are used as a\nstable foundation or road/rail base with predictable, uniform properties (e.g.\nto help prevent differential settling under the road or building), or as a low-\ncost extender that binds with more expensive cement or asphalt to form concrete.\n\nPreferred bitumenous aggregate sizes for road construction are given in EN 13043\nas d/D (where the range shows the smallest and largest square mesh grating that\nthe particles can pass). The same classification sizing is used for larger\narmour stone sizes in EN 13383, EN 12620 for concrete aggregate, EN 13242 for\nbase layers of road construction and EN 13450 for railway ballast.\n\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials publishes an exhaustive listing\nof specifications for various construction aggregate products, which, by their\nindividual design, are suitable for specific construction purposes. These\nproducts include specific types of coarse and fine aggregate designed for such\nuses as additives to asphalt and concrete mixes, as well as other construction\nuses. State transportation departments further refine aggregate material\nspecifications in order to tailor aggregate use to the needs and available\nsupply in their particular locations.\n\nSources for these basic materials can be grouped into three main areas: Mining\nof mineral aggregate deposits, including sand, gravel, and stone; use of waste\nslag from the manufacture of iron and steel; and recycling of concrete, which is\nitself chiefly manufactured from mineral aggregates. In addition, there are some\n(minor) materials that are used as specialty lightweight aggregates: clay,\npumice, perlite, and vermiculite.\n","linknr":234,"url":"Construction_aggregate","recorded":1362562516,"links":45,"instances":["composite","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/GJ/main/cvgrjr/2000gj/ssrq/SRRQREPT.pdf","http://www.co.marin.ca.us/depts/GJ/main/cvgrjr/2000gj/ssrq/SRRQREPT.pdf","http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/meyer_egosi_paper.pdf","http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/meyer_egosi_paper.pdf","http://www.grdp.org/static/documents/EWC_31-03-09_CH.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/myb1-2006-stonc.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/stone_crushed/cstonmyb05.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sand_and_gravel_construction/myb1-2006-sandg.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sand_and_gravel_construction,sandgmyb05.pdf","http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/iron_&_steel_slag/myb1-2006-fesla.pdf","http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1998/c1176/c1176.pdf","http://www.qpa.org/downloads/qid_rec.pdf","http://www.qpa.org/downloads/AggsataGlanceDL.pdf"],"categories":["Building stone","Building materials","Concrete","Granular materials","Pavements","Stone"],"headings":["History","Modern production","Recycled materials for aggregates","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c4/Limestone_processing_plant%2C_Tennessee.jpg/220px-Limestone_processing_plant%2C_Tennessee.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/10mm-aggregate.jpg/220px-10mm-aggregate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/20mm-aggregate.jpg/220px-20mm-aggregate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Point_San_Pedro_07798.JPG/220px-Point_San_Pedro_07798.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["capital","economics"],["aggregate","composite"]],"members":["aggregate","capital"],"related":["Material","Construction","Sand","Gravel","Crushed_stone","Slag","Composite_material","Concrete","Asphalt_concrete","Railroad","American_Society_for_Testing_and_Materials","Clay","Pumice","Perlite","Vermiculite","Roman_Empire","Vitruvius","Quarry","Limestone","Granite","Marble","Bedrock","Mining","Barge","Truck","Concrete","Capital_(economics)","Rock_crusher","USGS","Dimension_stone","USGS","Electric_train","Blast_furnace","Slag","Portland_cement","USGS","Fill","Tumwater,_Washington","Public_Works","Glass_recycling","USGS","Construction","Inert","Waste_characterisation","Aggregate_(composite)","Aggflow","Alkali-aggregate_reaction","Alkali_Silica_Reaction","Pozzolanic_reaction","Concrete","Crushed_stone","Dimension_stone","Marble","Road_metal","Saturated-surface-dry","Hoggin"]}
