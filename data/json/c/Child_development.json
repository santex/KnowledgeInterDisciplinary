Because these\ndevelopmental changes may be strongly influenced by genetic factors and events\nduring prenatal life, genetics and prenatal development are usually included as\npart of the study of child development. Related terms include developmental\npsychology, referring to development throughout the lifespan, and pediatrics,\nthe branch of medicine relating to the care of children. Developmental change\nmay occur as a result of genetically-controlled processes known as maturation,\nor as a result of environmental factors and learning, but most commonly involves\nan interaction between the two. It may also occur as a result of human nature\nand our ability to learn from our environment. Human beings have a keen sense to\nadapt to their surroundings and this is what child development encompasses.\nEvery child would struggle to find their culture and identity in child developm-\nent. http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/-\n13482721438326488881.pdf\n\nThere are various definitions of periods in a child's development, since each\nperiod is a continuum with individual differences regarding start and ending.\n\nSome age-related development periods and examples of defined intervals are:\nnewborn (ages 0â4 weeks); infant (ages 4 weeks â 1 year); toddler (ages 1â3\nyears); preschooler (ages 4â6years); school-aged child (ages 6â13 years);\nadolescent (ages 13â20). However, organizations like Zero\nto Three and the World Association for Infant Mental Health use the term infant\nas a broad category, including children from birth to age 3.\n\nThe optimal development of children is considered vital to society and so it is\nimportant to understand the social, cognitive, emotional, and educational\ndevelopment of children. Increased research and interest in this field has\nresulted in new theories and strategies, with specific regard to practice that\npromotes development within the school system. In addition there are also some\ntheories that seek to describe a sequence of states that compose child\ndevelopment.\n","linknr":1377,"url":"Child_development","recorded":1362479229,"links":63,"instances":["mathematics","psychodynamics","biology","activity","statistics","psychology","education","linguistics","memory","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/13482721438326488881.pdf","http://tm.ermarian.net/Academic%20Junk/Psychology/Neuroscience/Learning/Greenough,%20W.,%20Black,%20J.,%20Wallace%20C.%20%281987%29%20-%20Experience%20and%20Brain%20Development.pdf","http://tm.ermarian.net/Academic%20Junk/Psychology/Neuroscience/Learning/Greenough,%20W.,%20Black,%20J.,%20Wallace%20C.%20%281987%29%20-%20Experience%20and%20Brain%20Development.pdf","http://www.york.ac.uk/res/wml/Gathercole06%20Applied%20PsyLinguistics.pdf","http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/34/9/1885.full.pdf","http://www.ceecis.org/iodine/04a_consequences/02_int/chapt_on_i_brain.pdf","https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/docs/07_02_03.pdf","http://www.headstartresourcecenter.org/Hispanic/Workshops/The%20Socio-Emotional%20and%20Cognitive%20Development%20of%20Migrant%20Children/Home%20Env.%20of%20Children%20in%20US.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_749.pdf","http://www.cityofmadison.com/water/waterQuality/documents/EHP.20100920.MnIQ.pdf"],"categories":["Developmental
