A series of events\nwhich culminated in episodes of violence led those Nez Perce who resisted\nremoval including Joseph's band and an allied band of the Palouse tribe to take\nflight to attempt to reach political asylum, ultimately with the Sioux chief\nSitting Bull in Canada.\n\nThey were pursued by the U.S. Army in a campaign led by General Oliver O.\nHoward. This epic fighting retreat by the Nez Perce in 1877 became known as the\nNez Perce War. The skill in which the Nez Perce fought and the manner in which\nthey conducted themselves in the face of incredible adversity led to widespread\nadmiration among their military adversaries and the American public.\n\nCoverage of the war in United States newspapers led to widespread recognition of\nJoseph and the Nez Perce. For his principled resistance to the removal, he\nbecame renowned as a humanitarian and peacemaker.\n","linknr":310,"url":"Chief_Joseph","recorded":1362674548,"links":35,"instances":["native_american_leader","united_states","military"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1840 births","1904 deaths","American humanitarians","Native American history of Oregon","Native American leaders","Native American people of the Indian Wars","Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest","Nez Perce tribe","Nez Perce War","People from Lewiston, Idaho","People from Oregon"],"headings":["Background","Leadership of the Nez Perce","Nez Perce War","Aftermath","Films and books about Chief Joseph","Legacy","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Chief_Joseph-1877.jpg/240px-Chief_Joseph-1877.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Chief_Joseph_signature.svg/150px-Chief_Joseph_signature.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Nezperce01.png/240px-Nezperce01.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Alice_Fletcher2.gif/220px-Alice_Fletcher2.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Flight_of_the_Nez_Perce-1877-map.jpg/300px-Flight_of_the_Nez_Perce-1877-map.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Chief_Joseph_and_family.JPG/220px-Chief_Joseph_and_family.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Joseph.JPG/250px-Joseph.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["washington","u.s._state"],["general","united_states"],["looking_glass","native_american_leader"],["washington","u.s._state"],["surrender","military"]],"members":["looking_glass","general","surrender","washington"],"related":["Nez_Perce_people","Wallowa_River","Oregon","Colville_Indian_Reservation","Washington_(U.S._state)","Nespelem,_Washington","Americanist_phonetic_notation","Nez_Perce_people","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Wallowa_Valley","Oregon","Pacific_Northwest","United_States","Indian_removal","Wallowa_Valley","United_States_federal_government","Indian_reservation","Lapwai,_Idaho","Idaho_Territory","Palouse","Political_asylum","Sioux","Sitting_Bull","Canada","United_States_Army","General_(United_States)","Oliver_O._Howard","Nez_Perce_War","United_States_newspapers","Nez_Perce_language","Wallowa_River","Oregon","Old_Chief_Joseph","Isaac_Stevens","List_of_Governors_of_Washington","Washington_Territory","Gold_rush","Lapwai,_Idaho","Alice_Cunningham_Fletcher","Interpreting","Prospecting","United_States","Oliver_O._Howard","Fort_Lapwai","Toohoolhoolzote","Chief_White_Bird","Looking_Glass_(Native_American_leader)","Nez_Perce_War","Palouse","Crow_nation","Montana_Territory","Sioux","Sitting_Bull","Oregon","Washington_(U.S._state)","Idaho","Wyoming","Montana","Surrender_(military)","Nelson_A._Miles","Bear_Paw_Mountains","Montana_Territory","Chinook,_Montana","Blaine_County,_Montana","Charles_Erskine_Scott_Wood","William_Tecumseh_Sherman","Napoleon_I_of_France","William_Sherman","Fort_Leavenworth","Indian_Territory","Oklahoma","President_of_the_United_States","Rutherford_B._Hayes","Colville_Indian_Reservation","Chief_Moses","Sinkiuse-Columbia","Ulysses_Grant","Buffalo_Bill","Theodore_Roosevelt","Helen_Hunt_Jackson","Helen_Hunt_Jackson","Nespelem,_Washington","Walt_Disney_World_Resort","Epcot","Ned_Romero","Robert_Penn_Warren","Newbery_Medal","Scott_O'Dell","Chief_Joseph_Scenic_Byway","Chief_Joseph_Dam","Joseph,_Oregon","Joseph_Canyon","Chief_Joseph_Pass","North_American_Review","Wallowa_River","Colville_Indian_Reservation"]}
