(A stimulus is a factor that causes a response in an organism.) The\nconditioned response is the learned response to the previously neutral\nstimulus. The US is usually a biologically significant stimulus such\nas food or pain that elicits a response from the start; this is called the\nunconditioned response or UR. The CS usually produces no particular response at\nfirst, but after conditioning it elicits the conditioned response or CR.\nClassical conditioning differs from ''operant'' or ''instrumental''\nconditioning, in which behavior emitted by the subject is strengthened or\nweakened by its consequences (i.e. reward or punishment).

(2007) Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis,\nSunderland, MA: Sinauer\n\nThere are many examples of these innate (unconditioned) reflexes (corneal,\ncoughing, swallowing, withdrawal reflexes etc.) or learned (conditioned)\nreflexes. {{cite book\n| last = Schmidt first = R.

Pavlov, I.P. (1927/1960). Conditional Reflexes.\nNew York: Dover Publications (the 1960 edition is not an unaltered republication\nof the 1927 translation by Oxford University Press\nhttp://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Pavlov/). Pavlov presented dogs with a\nringing bell followed by food. The food elicited salivation (UR), and after\nrepeated bell-food pairings the bell also caused the dogs to salivate. In this\nexperiment,the unconditioned stimulus is the dog food as it produces an\nunconditioned response, saliva. The conditioned stimulus is the ringing bell and\nit produces a conditioned response of the dogs producing saliva.\n\nIt was originally thought that the process underlying classical conditioning was\none where the conditioned stimulus becomes associated with, and eventually\nelicits, the unconditioned response. But many observations do not support this\nhypothesis. For example, the conditioned response is often quite different from\nthe unconditioned response. Learning theorists now more commonly suggest that\nthe CS comes to signal or predict the US. In the case of the salivating dogs in\nPavlov's experiment, the bell tone signaled and predicted the arrival of the dog\nfood, thus resulting in the dog salivating.
