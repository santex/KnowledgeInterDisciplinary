It occurs when two (or more) beneficial mutations arise\nindependently in different individuals in a genetically homogeneous population.\nIn the absence of genetic recombination, the mutations cannot join to form an\norganism carrying both of them, but they compete against each other. This\ntypically leads to the loss of one of them.
