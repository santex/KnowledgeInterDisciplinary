{"cursor":"43176","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Commercial Crew Development' ('CCDev') is a multiphase space technology\ndevelopment program, funded by the U.S. government, and administered by NASA.\nThe program is intended to stimulate development of privately operated crew\nvehicles to low Earth orbit. It is run by the Commercial Crew and Cargo Program\nOffice (C3PO) at NASA. [http://www.nasa.gov/offices/c3po/about/index.html\nCommercial Crew & Cargo Program Office], NASA website, August 10, 2009, accessed\nDecember 19, 2010. William Gerstenmaier, NASA's Associate Administrator\nfor Human Exploration and Operations for NASA, has stated that most likely only\none competitor will be chosen to deliver crew to the ISS. This\nspacecraft is expected to begin doing so around 2017.\n\nIn the first phase of the program, NASA provided a combined $50 million in 2010\nto five American companies, intended to foster research and development into\nhuman spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector.\n\nA second set of Commercial Crew Development proposals were solicited by NASA in\nOctober 2010 for technology development project durations of up to 14\nmonths. In April 2011, NASA announced that they\nwould award up to nearly $270 million to four companies as they meet their CCDev\n2 objectives.\n\nNASA awarded Space Act Agreements for the third phase, named CCiCap, in August\n2012 and is to last until 2014.\n","linknr":630,"url":"Commercial_Crew_Development","recorded":1362267915,"links":47,"instances":["spacecraft","rocket","spacecraft","spacecraft","company"],"pdf":["http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/660622main_2012.06.18_CCP.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/660622main_2012.06.18_CCP.pdf","http://hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Reference/CCDev_Source_Selection_Statement_signed-1.pdf","http://hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Reference/CCDev_Source_Selection_Statement_signed-1.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/475795main_rendezvous_v4n3.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/475795main_rendezvous_v4n3.pdf","http://www.aiaa.org/pdf/industry/presentations/Lindenmoyer_C3PO.pdf","http://www.aiaa.org/pdf/industry/presentations/Lindenmoyer_C3PO.pdf","http://www.hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Reference/CCDev_Source_Selection_Statement_signed-1.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/580961main_CCPCCDev2-Public_508.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/580961main_CCPCCDev2-Public_508.pdf","http://procurement.ksc.nasa.gov/documents/NNK11MS02S_SAA_BlueOrigin_04-18-2011.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/713715main_CCP_Overview_20121203_508.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/713715main_CCP_Overview_20121203_508.pdf","http://www.paragonsdc.com/docs/CCT-ARS%20Press%20Release.pdf","http://www.paragonsdc.com/docs/CCT-ARS%20Press%20Release.pdf","http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/101211_Gerstenmaier.pdf","http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/hearings/101211_Gerstenmaier.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/729639main_February_2013_60_Day_Report_508.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/729639main_February_2013_60_Day_Report_508.pdf"],"categories":["Human
