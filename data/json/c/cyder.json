      "text" : "\n\n\n'Cider' or 'cyder' ( ) is a fermented alcoholic beverage made from fruit juice,\nmost commonly and traditionally apple juice, but also the juice of peaches or\nother fruit. Cider varies in alcohol content from 2% ABV to 8.5% or more in\ntraditional English ciders. In some regions, such as Germany and United States,\ncider may be called \"apple wine\".<ref></ref>\n\nIn the United States and some parts of Canada, \"hard cider\" usually refers to\nthe alcoholic beverage discussed in this article, while \"cider\" may refer to non-\nalcoholic apple cider. When sugar or extra fruit has been added and a secondary\nfermentation increases the alcoholic strength, a cider is classified as \"apple\nwine\".<ref name=Tax/><ref name=Brown/>\n\nCider may be made from any variety of apple, but certain cultivars grown solely\nfor use in cider are known as cider apples.<ref></ref> Cider is popular in the\nUnited Kingdom, especially in South West England and East Anglia. The United\nKingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest\ncider-producing companies in the world,<ref name=\"cideruk\"></ref> including H.\nP. Bulmer, the largest.<ref></ref> , the UK produces 600 million litres of\ncider each year (130 million imperial gallons).<ref></ref> Much cider today is\nmade from apple pulp rather than fresh apples and may contain added sweeteners\nor flavours.\n\nThe beverage is also popular and traditional in some European countries as\nIreland and the French regions of Brittany (chistr) and Normandy (cidre); In\nSpain it is especially popular in the Principality of Asturias (sidra) although\nit can also be found in the Basque Country (sagardo) and Galicia (sidra);\nGermany is another country where cider is drunk, above all in Rhineland-\nPalatinate and Hesse (Frankfurt am Main). Argentina is also a cider-producing\nand -drinking country, especially the provinces of RÌo Negro and Mendoza.\nAustralia also produces cider, particularly on the island of Tasmania, which has\na strong apple-growing tradition.\n\nPear cider is used as an alternative name for perry in the marketing of some\nproducers products.<ref></ref>\n",
