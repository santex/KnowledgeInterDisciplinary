{"cursor":"68738","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n; an interaction similar to a lock and key.]]\n\nAn 'antibody' (Ab), also known as an 'immunoglobulin' (Ig), is a large Y-shaped\nprotein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and\nneutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes\na unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen. Each tip of the \"Y\" of an\nantibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous to a lock) that is specific\nfor one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen,\nallowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this\nbinding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack\nby other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for\nexample, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and\nsurvival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral\nimmune system.\n\nAntibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell.\nAntibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from\nthe cell, and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell\nand is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the\nsurface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their\nsubsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells,\nor memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen\nso the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T\nhelper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and,\ntherefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble\nantibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many\nsecretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.\n\nAntibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily; the\nterms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably. Antibodies are typically made of basic structural unitsâeach\nwith two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several\ndifferent types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of\nantibodies, which are grouped into different [[isotype (immunology)|isotypes]]\nbased on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are\nknown in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate\nimmune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.\n\nThough the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region\nat the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies\nwith slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This\nregion is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to\na different antigen. This enormous diversity of\nantibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of\nantigens. The large and diverse population of antibodies\nis generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode\ndifferent antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in\nthis area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. Antibody genes also re-organize in a process\ncalled class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another,\ncreating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific\nvariable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different\nparts of the immune system.\n","linknr":1458,"url":"Constant_region","recorded":1362486691,"links":90,"instances":["genetics","biology","immunology","biology","medical","computing","zoology","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/kbm0603-146.pdf","http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/kbm0603-146.pdf","http://www.jem.org/cgi/reprint/203/1/5.pdf","http://www.jem.org/cgi/reprint/203/1/5.pdf","http://users.path.ox.ac.uk/~seminars/halelibrary/Paper%2018.pdf","http://users.path.ox.ac.uk/~seminars/halelibrary/Paper%2018.pdf"],"categories":["Antibodies|","Glycoproteins","Immune
