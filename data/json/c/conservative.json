A person who follows the\nphilosophies of conservatism is referred to as a 'traditionalist' or\n'conservative'.\n\nSome conservatives seek to preserve things as they are, emphasizing stability\nand continuity, while others, called reactionaries, oppose modernism and seek a\nreturn to \"the way things were\".<ref>Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan,\n\"Conservatism\", Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics, Third Edition, \"Sometimes\nit (conservatism) has been outright opposition, based on an existing model of\nsociety that is considered right for all time. It can take a 'reactionary' form,\nharking back to, and attempting to reconstruct, forms of society which existed\nin an earlier period.\", Oxford University Press, 2009, ISBN 978-0-19-920516-\n5.</ref><ref name=\"brit\"> Retrieved on 1&nbsp;November 2009.</ref> The first\nestablished use of the term in a political context was by François-René de\nChateaubriand in 1819, following the French\nRevolution.<ref>[http://hnn.us/articles/43075.html The Scary Echo of the\nIntolerance of the French Revolution in America Today]</ref> The term,\nhistorically associated with right-wing politics, has since been used to\ndescribe a wide range of views. There is no single set of policies that are\nuniversally regarded as conservative, because the meaning of conservatism\ndepends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus,\nconservatives from different parts of the world—each upholding their respective\ntraditions—may disagree on a wide range of issues.\n\nEdmund Burke, an Anglo-Irish politician who served in the British House of\nCommons and opposed the French Revolution, is credited as one of the founders of\nconservatism in Great\nBritain.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/burke_edmund.shtml\nBBC: Edmund Burke (1729–1797)]</ref> According to Quintin Hogg, a former\nchairman of the British Conservative Party, \"Conservatism is not so much a\nphilosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in\nthe development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent\nrequirement of human nature itself.\"<ref>Viscount Hailsham.
