From\nleft to right: hydrogen, barium, copper, uranium, bromine, and helium. }}\n\nA 'chemical element' is a pure chemical substance consisting of one type of atom\ndistinguished by its atomic number, which is the number of protons in its\nnucleus. Elements are divided into metals, metalloids, and non-metals. Familiar\nexamples of elements include carbon, oxygen (non-metals), silicon, arsenic\n(metalloids), aluminium, iron, copper, gold, mercury, and lead (metals).\n\nThe lightest chemical elements, including hydrogen, helium (and smaller amounts\nof lithium, beryllium and boron), are thought to have been produced by various\ncosmic processes during the Big Bang and cosmic-ray spallation. Production of\nheavier elements, from carbon to the very heaviest elements, proceeded by\nstellar nucleosynthesis, and these were made available for later solar system\nand planetary formation by planetary nebulae and supernovae, which blast these\nelements into space.<ref></ref> The high abundance of oxygen, silicon, and iron\non Earth reflects their common production in such stars, after the lighter\ngaseous elements and their compounds have been subtracted. While most elements\nare generally viewed as stable, a small amount of natural transformation of one\nelement to another also occurs at the present time through decay of radioactive\nelements as well as other natural nuclear processes.\n\nThe history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human\nsocieties that found native elements like copper and gold and extracted\n(smelted) iron and a few other metals from their ores. Alchemists and chemists\nsubsequently identified many more, with nearly all of the naturally-occurring\nelements becoming known by 1900. The properties of the chemical elements are\noften summarized using the periodic table that organizes the elements by\nincreasing atomic number into rows (\"periods\") in which the columns (\"groups\")\nshare recurring (\"periodic\") physical and chemical properties. Save for short-half-\nlife radioactive elements, all of the elements are available industrially, most\nof them to high degrees of purity.\n\nHydrogen and helium are by far the most abundant elements in the universe.\nHowever, iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up the Earth, and\noxygen is the most common element in Earth's crust.<ref name=LosAlamos></ref>\nAlthough all known chemical matter is composed of these elements, chemical\nmatter itself is hypothesized to constitute only about 15% of the matter in the\nuniverse. The remainder is believed to be dark matter, a mysterious substance\nthat is not composed of chemical elements, since it lacks protons, neutrons or\nelectrons.<ref></ref>\n\nWhen two or more distinct elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held\ntogether by chemical bonds, the result is termed a chemical compound. Two thirds\nof the chemical elements occur on Earth only as compounds, and in the remaining\nthird, often the compound forms of the element are most common. Chemical\ncompounds may be composed of elements combined in exact whole-number ratios of\natoms, as in water, table salt, and minerals such as quartz, calcite, and some\nores. However, chemical bonding of many types of elements results in crystalline\nsolids and metallic alloys for which exact chemical formulas do not exist.\nRelatively pure samples of isolated elements are uncommon in nature. While all\nof the 98 naturally occurring elements have been identified in mineral samples\nfrom Earth's crust, only a small minority of elements are found as recognizable,\nrelatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such \"native elements\" are\ncopper, silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), sulfur, and\nmercury. All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble\nmetals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical\ncompounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native\nuncombined form, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air\nis primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements\noccur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel.\n\nAs of November 2011, 118 elements have been identified, the latest being\nununseptium in 2010.<ref name=\"Oganessian2010\"></ref> Of the 118 known elements,\nonly the first 98 are known to occur naturally on Earth; 80 of them are stable,\nwhile the others are radioactive, decaying into lighter elements over various\ntimescales from fractions of a second to billions of years. Those elements that\ndo not occur naturally on Earth have been produced artificially as the synthetic\nproducts of man-made nuclear reactions.\n",
