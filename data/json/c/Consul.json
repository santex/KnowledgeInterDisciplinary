{"cursor":"7707","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nRoman consul\n\n\n'Consul' (abbrev. cos.; Latin plural consules) was the highest elected office\nof the Roman Republic and an appointive office under the Empire. The title was\nalso used in other city states and also revived in modern states, notably in\nthe First French Republic. The relating adjective is 'consular', from the\nLatin [[consularis]] (which has been used, substantiated, as a title in its\nown right).\n\nOther uses in antiquity Other city states While many cities (as in Gaul) had a\ndouble-headed chief magistracy, often another title was used, such as Duumvir or\nnative styles such as Meddix, but Consul was used in some.\n\nPrivate sphere It was not uncommon for an organization under Roman private\nlaw to copy the terminology of state and city institutions for its own\nstatutory agents. The founding statute, or contract, of such an organisation\nwas called lex, 'law'. The people elected each year were patricians, members\nof the upper class.\n\nMedieval city states The Dukes of Gaeta often used also the title of \"Consul\" in\nits Greek form \"Hypatos (see List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta).\n\nThe city-state of Genoa, unlike ancient Rome, bestowed the title of Consul on\nvarious state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these\nwere Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role\nincluded helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local\nauthorities. This institution, with its name, was later emulated by other powers\nand is reflected in the modern usage of the word (see Consul (representative)).\n\nIn England, the clerks of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, made a practice of\nusing the Latin word consul rather than the more common comes when translating\nhis title of 'Earl'. Modern historians sometimes call him \"Robert the Consul\",\nfor that reason, though he himself and his contemporaries did not use that name.\n\nFrench Revolution French Republic\n\n, Napoleon Bonaparte and Charles-\nFranÃ§ois Lebrun (left to right)]]\n\nAfter Napoleon Bonaparte in November 1799 staged a coup against the\nDirectory government, the French Republic adopted a constitution, which\nconferred executive powers upon three Consuls, elected for a period of ten\nyears. In reality, the First Consul, Bonaparte, dominated his two colleagues\nand held supreme power, soon making himself Consul for life and eventually,\nin 1804, Emperor.\n\nThe office was held by\n    * Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmanuel-Joseph SieyÃ¨s, Roger Ducos, Provisional\n      Consuls (10 November â 12 December 1799)\n    * Napoleon Bonaparte (First Consul), Jean-Jacques CambacÃ©rÃ¨s (Second\n      Consul), Charles-FranÃ§ois Lebrun (Third Consul), Consuls (12 December 1799\n      â 18 May 1804)\n\nRoman Republic The French-sponsored Roman Republic (15 February 1798 â 23 June\n1800) was headed by multiple consuls:\n    * Francesco Riganti, Carlo Luigi Costantini, Duke Bonelli-Crescenzi, Antonio\n      Bassi, Gioacchino Pessuti, Angelo Stampa, Domenico Maggi, Provisional\n      Consuls (15 February â 20 March 1798)\n    * Liborio Angelucci, Giacomo De Mattheis, Panazzi, Reppi, Ennio Quirino\n      Visconti, Consuls (20 March â September 1798)\n    * Brigi, Calisti, Francesco Pierelli, Giuseppe Rey, Federico Maria Domenico\n      Michele, Zaccaleoni, Consuls (September â 24 July 1799)\n\n''Consular rule was interrupted by the Neapolitan occupation (27 November â 12\nDecember 1798), which installed a Provisional Government:\n    * Prince Giambattista Borghese, Prince Paolo-Maria Aldobrandini, Prince\n      Gibrielli, Marchese Camillo Massimo, Giovanni Ricci (29 November 1798 - 12\n      December 1798)\n\nRome was occupied by France (11 July â 28 September 1799) and again by Naples\n(30 September 1799 â 23 June 1800), bringing an end to the Roman Republic.\n\nBolognese Republic The short-lived Bolognese Republic, proclaimed in 1796 as a\nFrench client republic in the Central Italian city of Bologna, had a government\nconsisting of nine consuls and its head of state was the Presidente del\nMagistrato, i.e., chief magistrate, a presiding office held for four months by\none of the consuls. As noted above, Bologna already had Consuls at some parts of\nits Medieval history.\n\nLater modern republics Paraguay In between series of juntas (and various other\nshort-lived regimes), the young republic was governed by \"consuls of the\nrepublic\" in power (2 consuls alternating in power every 4 months):\n    * 12 October 1813 â 12 February 1814 JosÃ© Gaspar RodrÃ­guez de Francia y\n      Velasco (1st time)\n    * 12 February 1814 â 12 June 1814 Fulgencio Yegros y Franco de Torres\n    * 12 June 1814 â 3 October 1814 JosÃ© Gaspar RodrÃ­guez de Francia y Velasco\n      (2nd time); he stayed on as \"supreme dictator\" 3 October 1814 â 20\n      September 1840 (from 6 June 1816 styled \"perpetual supreme dictator\")\n\nAfter a few presidents of the Provisional Junta, there were again consuls of the\nrepublic, 14 March 1841 â 13 March 1844 (ruling jointly, but occasionally styled\n\"first consul\", \"second consul\"): Carlos Antonio LÃ³pez YnsfrÃ¡n (b. 1792 â d.\n1862) + Mariano Roque Alonzo Romero (d. 1853) (the lasts of the aforementioned\njuntistas, Commandant-General of the Army) Thereafter all republican rulers were\nstyled \"president\".\n\nRevolutionary Greece Among the many petty local republics that were formed\nduring the first year of the Greek Revolution, prior to the creation of a\nunified Provisional Government at the First National Assembly at\nEpidaurus, were:\n    * The Consulate of Argos (from 26 May 1821, under the Senate of the\n      Peloponnese) had a single head of state, styled consul, 28 March 1821 â 26\n      May 1821: Stamatellos Antonopoulos\n    * The Consulate of East Greece (Livadeia) (from 15 November 1821, under the\n      Areopagus of East Greece) was headed 1 April 1821 â 15 November 1821 by\n      three Consuls: Lambros Nakos, Ioannis Logothetis & Ioannis Filon\nNote: in [[Greek language|Greek]], the term for \"consul\" is \"ypatos\", which\n      translates as \"supreme one\", and hence does not necessarily imply a\n      joint office.\n\nSee also\n    * Captain Regent (similar modern position in San Marino's government)\n    * Consularis (Roman gubernatorial style)\n    * Consulate\n    *
