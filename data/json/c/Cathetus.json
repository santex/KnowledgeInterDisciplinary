{"cursor":"1809","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn a right triangle, the 'cathetus' (originally from the Greek word ; plural:\n'catheti'), commonly known as a 'leg', is either of the sides that are adjacent\nto the right angle. It is occasionally called the 'periphrasis'  (\"side about the right angle\"). The side opposite the right\nangle is the hypotenuse. When referring to the hypotenuse, the catheti are often\nreferred to simply as \"the other two sides\".\n\nIf the catheti of a right triangle have different lengths, distinction can be\nmade between the minor (shorter) and major (longer) cathetus. The ratio of the\nlengths of the catheti defines the trigonometric functions tangent and cotangent\n of the angles in the\ntriangle. In a right triangle, the length of the cathetus is also the geometric\nmean between the length of the segment cut by the altitude to the hypotenuse and\nthe length of the whole hypotenuse.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the catheti\nis equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Cathetus","recorded":1362684091,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary geometry","Triangles"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Triangle_Sides.svg/200px-Triangle_Sides.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Right_triangle","Greek_language","Right_angle","Periphrasis","Linguistics","Hypotenuse","Ratio","Trigonometric_functions","Tangent","Cotangent","Trigonometric_functions","Geometric_mean","Pythagorean_theorem"]}
