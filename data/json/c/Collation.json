{"cursor":"17171","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Collation' is the assembly of written information into a standard order. Many\nsystems of collation are based on numerical order or alphabetical order, or\nextensions and combinations thereof. Collation is a fundamental element of most\noffice filing systems, library catalogs and reference books.\n\nCollation differs from [[Document classification|classification]] in that\nclassification is concerned with arranging information into logical\ncategories, while collation is concerned with the ordering of items of\ninformation, usually based on the form of their identifiers. Formally\nspeaking, a collation method typically defines a total order on a set of\npossible identifiers, called sort keys, which consequently produces a total\npreorder on the set of items of information (items with the same identifier\nare not placed in any defined order).\n\nA collation algorithm such as the Unicode collation algorithm defines an order\nthrough the process of comparing two given character strings and deciding which\nshould come before the other. When an order has been defined in this way, a\n[[sorting algorithm]] can be used to put a list of any number of items into\nthat order.\n\nThe main advantage of collation is that it makes it fast and easy for a user to\nfind an element in the list, or to confirm that it is absent from the list. In\nautomatic systems this can be done using a binary search algorithm or\ninterpolation search; manual searching may be performed using a roughly similar\nprocedure, though this will often be done unconsciously. Other advantages are\nthat one can easily find the first or last elements on the list (most likely to\nbe useful in the case of numerically sorted data), or elements in a given range\n(useful again in the case of numerical data, and also with alphabetically\nordered data when one may be sure of only the first few letters of the sought\nitem or items).\n","linknr":220,"url":"Collation","recorded":1362559487,"links":32,"instances":["language","alphabet","language","orthography","character","chinese_character"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Collation|"],"headings":["Numerical and chronological order","Alphabetical order","Radical-and-stroke sorting","Automated collation","Labeling of ordered items","See also","Notes","External links and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["letter","alphabet"],["space","character"],["digraph","orthography"],["radical","chinese_character"],["digraph","orthography"],["german","language"],["turkish","language"]],"members":["turkish","letter","german","digraph","space","radical"],"related":["Number","Alphabetical_order","File_system","Library_catalog","Reference_book","Identifier","Total_order","Sort_key","Total_preorder","Unicode_collation_algorithm","Character_string","Binary_search_algorithm","Interpolation_search","Number","Scientific_notation","Calendar_date","Alphabetical_order","Letter_(alphabet)","Alphabet","Syllabary","Abugida","Cherokee_language","Capital_letter","Space_(character)","Dictionary","Telephone_directory","Given_name","Numerical_digit","Leet","Modified_letter","Spanish_language","Digraph_(orthography)","Dictionaries","Telephone_directories","Chinese_language","Hanzi","Japanese_language","Kanji","Radical_(Chinese_character)","Tokyo","Hiragana","Surname_stroke_order","Algorithm","Character_set","ASCII","Superset","Unicode","Lexicographical_order","Modified_letter","Digraph_(orthography)","Alphabetical_order","German_(language)","Turkish_(language)","Unicode","Unicode_Collation_Algorithm","Common_Locale_Data_Repository","Roman_numeral","Windows_XP","File_name","Decimal_separator","Leading_zero","ISO_8601","Arabic_numerals","Roman_numerals","Bulleted_list","Enumeration","Russian_alphabet","Ъ","Ь","Consonant","Ы","Й","Ё","Latin_script","Modified_letter","Alphabetical_order","Sorting","Taxonomic_sequence","Mac_and_Mc_together","Unicode_equivalence","Cascading_Style_Sheets","Unicode_Collation_Algorithm","International_Components_for_Unicode"]}
