{"cursor":"24992","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn genetics, the 'most recent common ancestor' ('MRCA') of any set of organisms\nis the most recent individual from which all organisms in the group are directly\ndescended. The term is often applied to human genealogy.\n\nThe MRCA of a set of individuals can sometimes be determined by referring to an\nestablished pedigree. However, in general, it is impossible to identify the\nspecific MRCA of a large set of individuals, but an estimate of the time at\nwhich the MRCA lived can often be given. Such time to MRCA ('TMRCA') estimates\ncan be given based on DNA test results and established mutation rates as\npracticed in genetic genealogy, or by reference to a non-genetic, mathematical\nmodel or computer simulation.\n\nThe term MRCA is usually used to describe a common ancestor of individuals\nwithin a species. It can also be used to describe a common ancestor between\nspecies. To avoid confusion, 'last common ancestor' ('LCA') or the equivalent\nterm 'concestor' is sometimes used in place of MRCA when discussing ancestry\nbetween species.\n\nThe term MRCA may also be used to identify a common ancestor between a set of\norganisms via specific gene pathways. The TMRCA in the case of gene pathways\nwill be different depending on how restrictive the choice of genes is. Choosing\na very restrictive gene such as mtDNA which is only inherited along the female\nlineage Mitochondrial Eve or the male equivalent Y-chromosomal Adam are examples\nof such MRCAs which yields TMRCA estimates orders of magnitude further back in\ntime than TMRCA if any possible line of descendancy is allowed. Such genealogies\nin reality trace ancestry of individual genes, not organisms. As a result, TMRCA\nestimates for genetic MRCAs are necessarily greater than those for MRCAs of\norganisms.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Concestor","recorded":1362372771,"links":38,"instances":["biology","writer","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www-bac.esi.umontreal.ca/~dbin1001/h06/presentations/transferts-horizontaux/HGT_genome_Olga_TIG_2004.pdf","http://www-bac.esi.umontreal.ca/~dbin1001/h06/presentations/transferts-horizontaux/HGT_genome_Olga_TIG_2004.pdf","http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf","http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/Ancestors.pdf","http://web.unife.it/progetti/genetica/Giorgio/PDFfiles/ajhg2003.pdf","http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/158/2/897.pdf","http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/158/2/897.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Genetic genealogy","Genealogy","Human evolution","Phylogenetics","Recent single origin hypothesis","Population genetics"],"headings":["MRCA of all living humans","MRCA of different species","MRCA of a population identified by a single genetic marker","Time to MRCA estimates","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg/220px-MtDNA-MRCA-generations-Evolution.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Collapsed_tree_labels_simplified.png/300px-Collapsed_tree_labels_simplified.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/32px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain","biology"],["history","u.s._tv_channel"],["locus","genetics"],["microsatellite","genetics"],["steve_olson","writer"]],"members":["history","domain","steve_olson","microsatellite","locus"],"related":["Genetics","Organism","Common_descent","Human","Genealogy","Pedigree_chart","Mutation_rate","Genetic_genealogy","Mitochondrial_Eve","Y-chromosomal_Adam","Binary_tree","Exponential_growth","High_Middle_Ages","World_population","Pedigree_collapse","Directed_acyclic_graph","Population_bottleneck","First_couple","Sexual_reproduction","Ship_of_Theseus_paradox","The_Ancestor's_Tale","Mesolithic","4th_millennium_BC","Domain_(biology)","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryote","Richard_Dawkins","Human","Organism","Human_evolution","Chimpanzee","Bonobo","Gorilla","Orangutan","Last_universal_ancestor","Colin_Tudge","History_(U.S._TV_channel)","BBC_One","Darwinius","Gene","Coalescent_theory","Sexual_reproduction","Allogamy","Locus_(genetics)","Mitochondrial_DNA","Nuclear_DNA","Mendelian_inheritance","Matrilineal","Mitochondrial_Eve","Y_chromosome","Patrilineality","Y-chromosomal_Adam","Genealogical_DNA_test","Mitochondrial_Eve","Y-chromosomal_Adam","Autosomal_chromosome","Independent_assortment","Genetic_recombination","Chromosomal_crossover","Chromatids","Meiosis","Haplogroup","Human_Y-chromosome_DNA_haplogroup","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Short_tandem_repeat","Y-STR","Haplotypes","Y-STR","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Descent_from_Genghis_Khan","Demic_diffusion","Cultural_diffusion","Neolithic_Europe","Human_migration","Upper_Paleolithic","Steve_Olson_(writer)","Monte_Carlo_method","Early_modern","Age_of_Discovery","Uncontacted_peoples","Sentinelese_people","Clade","Common_descent","Coalescent_theory","Genealogy","Genetic_distance","Genetic_genealogy","Genealogy","Genealogical_DNA_test","Lowest_common_ancestor","Phylogenetic_tree","Timeline_of_evolution","Timeline_of_human_evolution","National_Geographic_Channel","Stephen_Oppenheimer","Discovery_Channel","PBS","National_Geographic_Channel"]}
