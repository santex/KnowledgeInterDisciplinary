{"cursor":"5535","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Canadian Northern Pacific Railway' (CNoPR) was an historic Canadian railway\nwith a main line running between the AlbertaâBritish Columbia border and\nVancouver, British Columbia. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Canadian\nNorthern Railway (CNoR).\n\nThis railway existed mainly on paper, thus there were no cars or locomotives\nlettered as \"Canadian Northern Pacific\". As far as the public and most workers\nwere concerned, it was just a part of the CNoR.\n\nThe CNoPR was incorporated in 1910. A.B. Hopper and T.\nKearny, \"CNR Synoptical History of Organization Capital Stock, Funded Debt and\nOther General Information as of December 31, 1960,\" Canadian National Railways,\nMontreal, 1962. Copies are available in each Provincial Archive. The last\nspike was driven at Basque, British Columbia, near Ashcroft, in January 1915.\nThis event completed Canada's third transcontinental railway, which ran from\nQuebec City, Quebec, to Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nOn Vancouver Island CNoP had a line that competed with the Esquimalt and Nanaimo\nrail line (Owned by CP at the time) but went a different route from Victoria.\nThe route would go to Sooke (At the time Milnes Landing), through Leechtown,\nthen pass the west side of Shawnigan Lake to Cowichan Lake. Another section of\nrail went further northwest to Kissinger . This line was for logging. on Dec 20,\n1918 CNP (Along with Canadian Northern) was absorbed into the CNR.\n\nOriginally, the plan was to build the rail line from Victoria to Port Alberni\nfor passenger and freight service. This included a Victoria to Patricia Bay line\nwith a ferry service from Pat Bay to Port Mann (on the Fraser River in Surrey.\nIn 1911 work had begun on the up-Island rail, construction was slow throughout\nthe years due to issues. The Pat Bay line started construction in 1913 and was\ncompleted in 1916 and by 1917 the Patricia subsidiary from Victoria was opened\nfor passenger service. In late 1918 the rail line was under the new crown\ncorporation, the Canadian National Railway. The government at this time had no\ncompulsion to provide a passenger service from Vancouver Island to the mainland,\ninstead CN would serve freight on the island. The ferry that the ex-CNP ordered\narrived that same year from Quebec. It went into refit and by 1919 the ferry was\nin service for the Patricia Bay line for freight. That same year passenger\nservices ended on the Pat bay line, freight continued. The Victoria and Sidneys\nsection from Bazan bay to Sidney became part of the CNP in 1919. By 1932\n[[Canora]]{{dn|date=June 2013}}  is\nwithdrawn, three years later the track is abandoned and removed.\n\nConstruction continued though up island and by the spring of 1924 the tracks had\nreached the east end of Cowichan Lake. By 1928, the track reached Kissinger but\nby this time, the plan to continue to Port Alberni was abandoned.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1931 CN ran a passenger and freight service that ran up and down\nthe Island. Starting in 1922, service was from Victoria to Sooke (Milnes\nLanding). The rail was still under construction further up. By 1925 passenger\nservice was extended to Youbou on Cowichan Lake until finally CN dropped the\nservice in 1931.\n\nLogging and freight continued but this started disappearing. In 1957 the\nKissinger to Youbou rail was closed and abandoned first. At this time logging by\nrail was quickly moved to Logging trucks. The next rails to be abandoned were\nthe Deerholme to Saanich track. In 1990 the final surviving tracks were\nabandoned, completely removing Vancouver Island's second railway. This was not\nthe end of the route and soon it was revamped for pedestrian and cycling use and\nis now known as the Galloping Goose Trail.\n\nThe CNoR maintained other subsidiary companies, such as the Alberta Midland\nRailway (Vegreville, Alberta, to Drumheller, Alberta), the Canadian Northern\nAlberta Railway (CNoAR) (St. Albert, Alberta, to the AlbertaâBritish Columbia\nborder) and the Edmonton, Yukon, and Pacific Railway which ran from Strathcona,\nAlberta, to Edmonton, and later to Stony Plain, Alberta.\n\nThe CNoAR was also incorporated in 1910. Construction\nstarted at St. Albert in 1910 and the construction train passed into British\nColumbia around the beginning of 1913.\n\nThe line from Edmonton to Vancouver was approved for operation in October\n1915. The first westbound passenger train left\nEdmonton on November 23, 1915. Edmonton Bulletin, November 24, 1915.\nThe first eastbound passenger train left Vancouver on November 25, 1915. Initial\nmain line through service was three trains per week in each\ndirection. Edmonton Bulletin, November 26, 1915.\n\nThese were all operated as part of the CNoR system and were taken over by the\nCrown upon nationalization in 1918.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway","recorded":1375061458,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Canadian","/wiki/Railway","/wiki/Vancouver,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Railway","#cite_note-HopperKearny-1","/wiki/Basque,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Ashcroft,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Quebec_City,_Quebec","/wiki/Esquimalt_and_Nanaimo_Railway","/wiki/Sooke,_British_Columbia","/w/index.php?title=Leechtown&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Shawnigan_Lake_(British_Columbia)","/wiki/Cowichan_Lake","/w/index.php?title=Kissinger,_British_Columbia&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Port_Alberni","/wiki/Patricia_Bay","/wiki/Port_Mann","/wiki/Fraser_River","/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Crown_corporation","/wiki/Canora","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/Youbou","/w/index.php?title=Deerholme,_British_Columbia&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Saanich,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Galloping_Goose_Trail","/w/index.php?title=Alberta_Midland_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Vegreville,_Alberta","/wiki/Drumheller,_Alberta","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Alberta_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/St._Albert,_Alberta","/w/index.php?title=Edmonton,_Yukon,_and_Pacific_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Strathcona,_Alberta","/wiki/Stony_Plain,_Alberta","#cite_note-HopperKearny-1","/wiki/St._Albert,_Alberta","/wiki/Edmonton","#cite_note-HopperKearny-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Government_of_Canada","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-HopperKearny_1-0","#cite_ref-HopperKearny_1-1","#cite_ref-HopperKearny_1-2","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/File:CN_8880_rolls_past_Wood_Street_Crossing_in_Harvey.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/CN_8880_rolls_past_Wood_Street_Crossing_in_Harvey.jpg/50px-CN_8880_rolls_past_Wood_Street_Crossing_in_Harvey.jpg","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Canada-rail-transport-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Canada-rail-transport-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Canada-rail-transport-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&oldid=565428827","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_Alberta_railways","/wiki/Category:Defunct_British_Columbia_railways","/wiki/Category:Predecessors_of_the_Canadian_Northern_Railway","/wiki/Category:Canada_rail_transport_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_links_needing_disambiguation_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canadian+Northern+Pacific+Railway&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canadian+Northern+Pacific+Railway","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Talk:Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway","#","/wiki/Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Northern_Pacific_Railway&oldid=565428827","/w/index.php?title=Canad
