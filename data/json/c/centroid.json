Formally, the centroid of a plane\nfigure or two-dimensional shape is the arithmetic mean (\"average\") position of\nall the points in the shape. The definition extends to any object in n-\ndimensional space: its centroid is the mean position of all the points in all of\nthe coordinate directions.\n\nWhile in geometry the term 'barycenter' is a synonym for \"centroid\", in physics\n\"barycenter\" may also mean the physical center of mass or the center of gravity,\ndepending on the context. The center of mass (and center of gravity in a uniform\ngravitational field) is the arithmetic mean of all points weighted by the local\ndensity or specific weight. If a physical object has uniform density, then its\ncenter of mass is the same as the centroid of its shape.\n\nIn geography, the centroid of a radial projection of a region of the Earth's\nsurface to sea level is known as the region's geographical center.\n","title":"centroid","headings":["Properties","Locating the centroid","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Arithmetic_mean","2: List_of_centroids","2: Cut-the-knot","1: Mathematics","1: Physics","1: Plane_figure","1: Dimension","1: Center_of_mass","1: Density","1: Specific_weight","1: Geography","1: Geographical_center","1: Convex_set","1: Fixed_points_of_isometry_groups_in_Euclidean_space","1: Symmetry_group","1: Hyperplane","1: Symmetry","1: Regular_polygon","1: Regular_polyhedron","1: Rectangle","1: Rhombus","1: Ellipse","1: Ellipsoid","1: Lamé_curve","1: Superellipsoid","1: Parallelogram","1: Diagonal","1: Quadrilateral","1: Translational_symmetry","1: Planar_lamina","1: Plumbline","1: Integral","1: Indicator_function","1: Abscissa","1: Continuous_function","1: Triangle","1: Ratio","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Linear_density","1: Spieker_center","1: Incentre","1: Medial_triangle","1: Euler_line","1: Orthocenter","1: Circumcenter","1: Tetrahedron","1: Simplex","1: Isogonal_conjugate","1: Symmedian","1: Chebyshev_center","1: Fréchet_mean","1: K-means_algorithm","1: Pappus's_centroid_theorem","1: Triangle_center"]}
