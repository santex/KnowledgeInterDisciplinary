Along with the nitrogen cycle and the water cycle, the carbon cycle\ncomprises a sequence of events that are key to making the Earth capable of\nsustaining life; it describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and\nreused throughout the biosphere.\n\nThe 'global carbon budget' is the balance of the exchanges (incomes and losses)\nof carbon between the carbon reservoirs or between one specific loop (e.g.,\natmosphere â biosphere) of the carbon cycle. An examination of the carbon budget\nof a pool or reservoir can provide information about whether the pool or\nreservoir is functioning as a source or sink for carbon dioxide. The carbon\ncycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and\npopularized by Humphry Davy. Holmes, Richard. \"The Age Of\nWonder\", Pantheon Books, 2008.
