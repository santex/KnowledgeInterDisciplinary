Of the\nseveral viruses in the Coxsackie family, many of them seem to evoke this\nresponse, as do several other agents. A genetic predisposition appears to be\nimportant, such that individuals with human leukocyte antigen types DR3 and DR4\npredominate in the affected population.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Coxsackie_B4_virus","recorded":1362482129,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://archives.niddk.nih.gov/federal/dwg/fr.pdf"],"categories":["Picornaviruses"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Coxsackie_B4_virus.JPG/200px-Coxsackie_B4_virus.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Polio.jpg/30px-Polio.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Virus","Autoimmune","Insulin","Beta_cell","Pancreas","Diabetes_mellitus","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Coxsackievirus","Human_leukocyte_antigen","National_Institutes_of_Health"]}
