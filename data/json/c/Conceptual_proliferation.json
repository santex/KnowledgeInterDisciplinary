{"cursor":"2697","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In Buddhism, 'conceptual proliferation'(, ) refers to conceptualization of the\nworld through the use of ever-expanding language and concepts. Nanananda\n1997, p. 4 The translation of papaÃ±ca as conceptual proliferation was\nfirst made by Katukurunde Nanananda Thera in his research monograph Concept and\nReality.[2] It is a useful concept, not only in Buddhism but in many other\nfields (see below)\n\nIt is intended to elucidate reality, although it has the unexpected result of\nblotting out or reducing direct nonverbal sensory perception. In part, this is\ndue to each person's limitation of how many things they can pay attention to at\nthe same time. A person who can only attend to two things at once, may be able\nto receive a direct sensory picture of the tree while at the same time saying\n\"The apple tree in the garden,\" but the picture will not be as complete.\nThe Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind. Wisdom,\n2006 http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/prin11.htm\n\nAccident Prevention For example, California lists distraction (conceptual\nproliferation is perhaps the biggest) as one of the 3 major causes of accidents.\nhttp://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/brochures/fast_facts/ffdl28.htm\n\nThe term is mentioned in a variety of [[sutta]]s in the Pali canon, such as the\nMadhupindika Sutta (MN 18), and is mentioned in Mahayana Buddhism as well. When\nreferencing the concepts derived from this process, such concepts are referred\nto in Pali as papaÃ±ca-saÃ±Ã±Ä-sankhÄ.\n","linknr":455,"url":"Conceptual_proliferation","recorded":1362560253,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Buddhist terms"],"headings":["Nippapañca","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/40px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Buddhism","Pali_canon","Mahayana_Buddhism","Nibbana-The_Mind_Stilled","Monkey_mind"]}
