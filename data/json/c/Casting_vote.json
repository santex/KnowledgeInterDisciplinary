{"cursor":"3934","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'casting vote' is a vote given to the presiding officer of a council or\nlegislative body to resolve a deadlock and which can be exercised only when such\na deadlock exists. Examples of officers who hold casting votes are the Speaker\nof the British House of Commons and the Vice President of the United States (in\nhis constitutional capacity as President of the United States Senate).\n\nIn some legislatures, a casting vote may be exercised however the presiding\nofficer wishes. An example is the Vice President of the United States, who may\nexercise his casting vote in the Senate according to his party affiliation or\naccording to his own personal beliefs. By virtue of the Vice President's casting\nvote, when the Senate as elected is equally divided between two parties, the\nVice President's party automatically becomes the official majority party in the\nSenate. The exercise of the Vice President's casting vote has become\nincreasingly rare throughout American history as the size of the Senate has\ngrown from 26 to 100 and ties have become less probable.\n\nIn some other legislatures, by contrast, a casting vote can only be exercised\naccording to strict rules or conventions. For example, the Speaker of the\nBritish House of Commons is expected by constitutional convention to follow\nSpeaker Denison's rule, i.e. to vote to allow further discussion, if this is\npossible, and otherwise to vote against the proposal concerned.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Casting_vote","recorded":1375075645,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Voting","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(UK)","/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States","/wiki/List_of_the_Presidents_of_the_United_States_Senate","/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)","/wiki/Speaker_Denison%27s_rule","#Exceptions","#Casting_vote_at_elections","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_New_Zealand_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/President_of_the_Australian_Senate","/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives","/wiki/Congressman","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Returning_officer","/wiki/Bandon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/United_States_Vice_Presidents%27_tie-breaking_votes","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.dca.gov.uk/elections/gen-elec-brief-info.pdf","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&oldid=553567172","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Parliamentary_procedure","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Casting+vote&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Casting+vote","/wiki/Casting_vote","/wiki/Talk:Casting_vote","#","/wiki/Casting_vote","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Casting_vote","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Casting_vote","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&oldid=553567172","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3275080","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Casting_vote&id=553567172","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Casting+vote","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Casting+vote&oldid=553567172&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Casting_vote&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voto_de_calidad","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AD%B0%E9%95%B7%E6%B1%BA%E8%A3%81","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbeltstemme","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voto_de_Minerva","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3275080#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_vote","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["uk_parliament_constituency","uk","political_custom"],"pdf":["http://www.dca.gov.uk/elections/gen-elec-brief-info.pdf"],"categories":["Parliamentary
