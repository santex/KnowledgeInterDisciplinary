{"cursor":"12431","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn linguistics, 'cognates' are words that have a common etymological origin.\nThis learned term derives from the Latin [[:wikt:cognatus|cognatus]] (blood\nrelative). [http://www.answers.com/topic/cognate \"cognate\"], [[The American\nHeritage Dictionary of the English Language]], 4th ed.: \"Latin cognÄtus: co-,\nco- + gnÄtus, born, past participle of nÄscÄ«, to be born.\" Other definitions of\nthe English word include \"[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor\" and\n\"[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function\". Ibid. Cognates\nwithin the same language are called ''doublets''. Strictly speaking, loanwords\nfrom another language are not considered cognates.\n\nFor example, the English words shirt and skirt are doublets; the former derives\nfrom the Old English sÄyrte, while the latter is loaned from Old Norse skyrta,\nboth of which derive from the Proto-Germanic [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-\nGermanic/skurtijÅn|*skurtijÇ­]]. Additional cognates of the same word in other\nGermanic languages include the German SchÃ¼rze and Dutch schort (apron).\n","linknr":290,"url":"Cognate","recorded":1362373250,"links":42,"instances":["linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf"],"categories":["Historical linguistics","Language comparison"],"headings":["Characteristics of cognate words","Cognates across languages","Cognates within the same language","False cognates","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["doublet","linguistics"],["doublet","linguistics"]],"members":["doublet"],"related":["Linguistics","Etymology","Doublet_(linguistics)","Loanword","Old_English","List_of_English_words_of_Old_Norse_origin","Proto-Germanic","Germanic_languages","Semantic_drift","English_language","Dutch_language","German_language","Proto-Germanic","English_language","German_language","Latin_Language","Greek_language","Medieval_Latin","OED","False_friends","Indo-European_languages","English_language","French_language","German_language","Dutch_Language","Afrikaans_Language","Scots_language","Swedish_language","Norwegian_language","Danish_language","Faroese_language","Icelandic_language","Czech_language","Slovak_language","Polish_language","Russian_language","Macedonian_language","Bulgarian_language","Ukrainian_language","Belarusian_language","Slovene_language","Croatian","Ancient_Greek","Modern_Greek","Latin","Sanskrit","Albanian_language","Spanish_language","Welsh_language","Asturian_language","Portuguese_language","Galician_language","Italian_language","Catalan_language","Romanian_language","Latvian_Language","Lithuanian_language","Proto-Indo-European_language","Proto-Indo-European_language","English_language","Sanskrit","Hindustani_language","French_language","Greek_language","Modern_Greek","Italian_language","Latin","Romanian_language","Venetian_language","Gothic_language","Armenian_language","German_language","Afrikaans","Norwegian_language","Icelandic_language","Swedish_language","Faroese_language","Persian_language","Pashto_language","Welsh_language","Cornish_language","Catalan_language","Spanish_language","Asturian_language","Leonese_language","Portuguese_language","Galician_language","Kurdish_language","Hebrew_language","Arabic_language","Amharic_language","Proto-Semitic","Spanish_language","Ancient_Greek_language","White","Loanword","Neologism","Doublet_(linguistics)","Old_Norse_language","Danelaw","Middle_French","Etymological_twins","False_cognate","Proto-Indo-European_language","Grimm's_law","Hebrew_language","Mbabaram_language","False_etymology","False_friend","Cognate_object","Figura_etymologica","Historical-comparative_linguistics"]}
