{"cursor":"1617","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n 'Coin orientation' (or 'coin alignment' or variations of\nthese) is a feature of coins struck by some nations. In these nations, most\ncoins, including all modern coins, have their reverse turned, or aligned, in a\nspecified way relative to the obverse. There are essentially two options,\nreferred to as coin orientation and medallic orientation.\n\nFor a medal to display properly, even if it flips over, when it is tagged to a\nuniform, the reverse needs to be aligned so that the top of the reverse shares\nthe same position as the top of the obverse. This alignment is called medallic\norientation. The opposite situation is seen in some coins, e.g. coins of the\nUnited States - but not those of the United Kingdom. In this case, the coin must\nbe flipped about its horizontal axis in order to see the other side the correct\nway up. In other words, the image on one face of the coin is upside-down\nrelative to the other. For this reason, 'coin orientation' is used in the United\nStates to express the opposite of 'medal orientation'.\n\nCoins with coin orientation include United States coinage, South Korean coinage,\nThai coinage and pre-Euro French coinage.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Coin_orientation","recorded":1362554957,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coins|Orientation"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Money_template.svg/35px-Money_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Coin","Medallic_orientation","Medallic_orientation","United_Kingdom","United_States_coinage","South_Korean_won","Thai_baht","French_franc","Medallic_orientation"]}
