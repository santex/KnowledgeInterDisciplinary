[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/devolution/guidance/glossary_of_d-\nevolution_terms.aspx UK Cabinet Office: Devolution Glossary] (Accessed 7\nSeptember 2010): \"United Kingdom: Term used most frequently for the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the modern sovereign state\ncomprising England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\" Prior to 1922,\nthe entire island of Ireland rather than just Northern Ireland was one of the\ncountries. The alternative term [[home nations]] is also used, although today\nthis is mainly in sporting contexts and may still include all of Ireland.\n\nThe United Kingdom, a sovereign state under international law, is a member of\nintergovernmental organisations, the European Union and the United Nations.\nEngland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are not themselves listed in the\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) list of countries. However\nthe ISO list of the subdivisions of the UK is supplied by British Standards and\nthe Office for National Statistics and so uses \"country\" to describe England,\nScotland and Wales. [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-3_2011-12-\n13.pdf ISO Newsletter ii-3-2011-12-13] Northern Ireland, in contrast, is\ndescribed as a \"province\" in the same lists. The Parliament of the United Kingdom and Government of the United Kingdom\ndeal with all reserved matters for Northern Ireland and Scotland and all non-\ntransferred matters for Wales, but not in general matters that have been\ndevolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and National\nAssembly for Wales. Additionally, devolution in Northern Ireland is conditional\non co-operation between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of\nIreland (see North/South Ministerial Council). The Government of the United\nKingdom also consults with the Government of Ireland to reach agreement on some\nnon-devolved matters for Northern Ireland (see British-Irish Intergovernmental\nConference). England remains the full responsibility of the Parliament of the\nUnited Kingdom, which is centralised in London.\n\nEngland, Scotland and Wales have separate national governing bodies for many\nsports, and compete separately in many international sporting competitions.\nNorthern Ireland has a separate governing body for association football but\nforms joint all-Ireland sporting bodies with the Republic of Ireland for\nmost sports.\n\nThe Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are dependencies of the British Crown\nbut not part of the UK or of the European Union. Collectively, the United\nKingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are referred to in UK law as\nthe [[British Islands]]. Similarly, the British overseas territories, remnants\nof the British Empire scattered around the globe, are not constitutionally part\nof the UK. Formerly, the whole of Ireland was a country of the United Kingdom.\nThe Republic of Ireland is the sovereign state formed from the portion of\nIreland that seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922. Although part of the\ngeographical British Isles, the Republic of Ireland is not part of\nthe United Kingdom and has not been a Commonwealth realm since April 1949.\n","linknr":668,"url":"Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom","recorded":1362484576,"links":50,"instances":["historic","europe"],"pdf":["http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_3166-2_newsletter_ii-3_2011-12-13.pdf","http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/asset/News/6001/draft-response.pdf","http://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/asset/News/6001/draft-response.pdf","http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/71887/sample/9780521771887ws.pdf","http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/71887/sample/9780521771887ws.pdf","http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20public%20attitudes.pdf","http://www.devolution.ac.uk/Final%20Conf/Devolution%20public%20attitudes.pdf","http://ethnos.co.uk/what_is_britishness_CRE.pdf","http://ethnos.co.uk/what_is_britishness_CRE.pdf"],"categories":["Geography
