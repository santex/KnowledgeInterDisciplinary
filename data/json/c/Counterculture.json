Eric Donald Hirsch. The Dictionary of Cultural\nLiteracy. Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0-395-65597-8. (1993) p 419. \"Members of a\ncultural protest that began in the U.S. in the 1960s and Europe before fading in\nthe 1970s... fundamentally a cultural rather than a political protest.\"\n\nA countercultural movement expresses the ethos, aspirations, and dreams of a\nspecific population during a well-defined era. When oppositional forces reach\ncritical mass, countercultures can trigger dramatic cultural changes.\n\nProminent examples of countercultures in Europe and North America include\nRomanticism (1790-1840), Bohemianism (1850-1910), the more fragmentary\ncounterculture of the Beat Generation (1944-1964), the Hippie counterculture (1964-\n1974) and Hipsterism (1990s-2010s).\n","linknr":663,"url":"Counterculture","recorded":1362580427,"links":51,"instances":["sociodynamics","magazine","contemporary_subculture","comics","british_subculture","comics","band","band","subculture","clothing","producer","scholar"],"pdf":["http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/02pdf/02-102.pdf"],"categories":["Counterculture|","Words
