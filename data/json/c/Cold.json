{"cursor":"8628","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n]]\n\n\n'Cold' refers to the condition or subjective perception of having low\ntemperature, the opposite of 'hot'. A cold body is often\ndescribed as having less heat, although this use of \"heat\" would be incorrect in\nthe context of physics, as heat refers to the transfer of energy between bodies,\nwhich do not \"have\" heat themselves.\n\nA lower bound to temperature is the absolute zero, defined as 0 K on the\nKelvin scale, an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. This corresponds to\nâ273.15 Â°C on the Celsius scale, â459.67 Â°F on the Fahrenheit scale,\nand 0 Â°R on the Rankine scale.\n\nSince temperature relates to the thermal energy held by an object or a sample of\nmatter, which is the kinetic energy of the random motion of the particle\nconstituents of matter, an object will have less thermal energy when it is\ncolder and more when it is hotter. If it were possible to cool a system to\nabsolute zero, all motion of the particles in a sample of matter would cease and\nthey would be at complete rest in this classical sense. The object would be\ndescribed as having zero thermal energy. Microscopically in the description of\nquantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute\nzero, because of the uncertainty principle.\n","linknr":280,"url":"Cold","recorded":1362901027,"links":35,"instances":["planet","moon","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cold|"],"headings":["Mammalian perception","Cooling","Notable cold locations and objects","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Antarctic_iceberg%2C_2001_-2.jpg/250px-Antarctic_iceberg%2C_2001_-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["triton","moon"],["mercury","planet"],["rigor","medicine"]],"members":["mercury","triton","rigor"],"related":["Subjectivity","Temperature","Heat","Physics","Energy","Absolute_zero","Kelvin_scale","Thermodynamic_temperature","Fahrenheit_scale","Rankine_scale","Thermal_energy","Kinetic_energy","Zero-point_energy","Uncertainty_principle","Mammal","Physiology","Metabolism","Heat_conduction","Convection","Radiation","Evaporation","Temperature","Fluids","Coolant","Air_cooling","Air","Temperature","Surface_area","Mass","Ice","Dry_ice","Liquid_nitrogen","Convection","Heat","Coolant","Laser_cooling","Magnetic_evaporative_cooling","Bose–Einstein_condensate","Satyendra_Nath_Bose","Eric_Cornell","Carl_Wieman","JILA","Rubidium","Laser_cooling","Steven_Chu","Claude_Cohen-Tannoudji","William_D._Phillips","Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","Magnetic_evaporative_cooling","Boomerang_Nebula","Universe","Kelvin","Herschel_Space_Observatory","Kelvin","Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","Big_bang","Triton_(moon)","Uranus","Black_body","Saturn","Black_body","Mercury_(planet)","Sun","Atmosphere","Heat","Sun","Jupiter","Black_body","Mars","Black_body","Earth","Antarctica","Antarctic_Plateau","South_Pole","Altitude","Vostok_Station","Chiller","Cryogenics","Cryosphere","Freezer","Freezer_burn","Icebox","Refrigeration","Refrigerator","Cocytus","Ice_cream","Indrid_Cold","Niflheim","Snowball","Snowman","Winter_sports","Frostbite","Hypothermia","Rigor_(medicine)","Shivering","Atmospheric_inversion","Cold_front","Frost","Hail","Ice","Iceberg","Icecaps","Sleet","Snowflake","Snow","Antarctica","Freezing_point","Glacier","North_Pole","Pole_of_Cold","South_Pole","Winter","Ice_cap_climate"]}
