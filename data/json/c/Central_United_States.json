Small areas near the Great\nLakes drain into the Great Lakes and eventually the St. Lawrence River; the Red\nRiver Basin is centered on the North Dakota-Minnesota border and drains to\nHudson Bay.\n\nThe Central Time Zone is the same area plus the Florida Panhandle, minus Ohio,\nMichigan, most of Indiana, westernmost fringes of Great Plains states, eastern\nand northern Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, and El Paso, Texas.\n\n Image:US Census Central\nDivisions.svg|Census Bureau Divisions with 'Central' in name.
