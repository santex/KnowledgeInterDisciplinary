In most cases the term is used to denote the\nprocesses of purification, separation, and decontamination of aqueous and other\nion-containing solutions with solid polymeric or mineralic 'ion exchangers'.\n\nTypical ion exchangers are ion exchange resins (functionalized porous or gel\npolymer), zeolites, montmorillonite, clay, and soil humus. Ion exchangers are\neither 'cation exchangers' that exchange positively charged ions (cations) or\n'anion exchangers' that exchange negatively charged ions (anions). There are\nalso '[[amphoterism|amphoteric]] exchangers' that are able to exchange both\ncations and anions simultaneously. However, the simultaneous exchange of cations\nand anions can be more efficiently performed in mixed beds that contain a\nmixture of anion and cation exchange resins, or passing the treated solution\nthrough several different ion exchange materials.\n\nIon exchangers can be unselective or have binding preferences for certain ions\nor classes of ions, depending on their chemical structure. This can be dependent\non the size of the ions, their charge, or their structure. Typical examples of\nions that can bind to ion exchangers are:\n\n* H + (proton) and OH â (hydroxide)\n* Single-charged monatomic ions like Na +, K +, and\n  Cl â\n* Double-charged monatomic ions like Ca 2+ and Mg 2+\n* Polyatomic inorganic ions like SO 42â and\n  PO 43â\n* Organic bases, usually molecules containing the amino functional group -\n  NR 2H +\n* Organic acids, often molecules containing -COO â (carboxylic acid)\n  functional groups\n* Biomolecules that can be ionized: amino acids, peptides, proteins, etc.\n\nAlong with absorption and adsorption, ion exchange is a form of sorption.\n\nIon exchange is a reversible process and the ion exchanger can be regenerated or\nloaded with desirable ions by washing with an excess of these ions.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Charge_exchange","recorded":1362485652,"links":35,"instances":["water","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry"],"headings":["Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Ionenaustauscher.jpg/220px-Ionenaustauscher.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Ion_exchange_resin_beads.jpg/200px-Ion_exchange_resin_beads.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Ion_exchange_column.jpg/300px-Ion_exchange_column.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["complex","chemistry"],["absorption","chemistry"],["filter","water"]],"members":["filter","complex","absorption"],"related":["Ion","Electrolyte","Solution","Complex_(chemistry)","Polymer","Mineral","Ion_exchange_resin","Gel","Zeolite","Montmorillonite","Clay","Soil","Humus","Electric_charge","Cation","Anion","Chemical_structure","Proton","Hydroxide","Sodium","Potassium","Chloride","Calcium","Magnesium","Inorganic_compound","Sulfate","Phosphate","Organic_base","Molecule","Amine","Functional_group","Organic_acid","Molecule","Carboxylic_acid","Biomolecule","Amino_acid","Peptide","Protein","Absorption_(chemistry)","Adsorption","Sorption","Reversible_process","Power_engineering","Polymer","Mineral","Solubility","Water_softening","Water_purification","Decontamination","Laundry_detergent","Filter_(water)","Soft_water","Calcium","Magnesium","Water_softening","Ion_exchange_chromatography","Ion_exchange_chromatography","Chromatography","Biochemistry","Protein","Amino_acids","DNA","RNA","Metal","Uranium","Plutonium","Actinide","Thorium","Lanthanum","Neodymium","Ytterbium","Samarium","Lutetium","Lanthanide","Rare_earth_element","Frank_Spedding","PUREX","Plutonium","Uranium","Nuclear_reactor","Nuclear_weapon","Zirconium","Hafnium","Control_rod","Nuclear_reprocessing","Radioactive_waste","Proton_exchange_membrane","Chloralkali_process","Fuel_cell","Vanadium_redox_battery","Soil_science","Cation_exchange_capacity","Soil","Geotechnical_engineering","Expansive_clay","Montmorillonite","Waveguide","Index_of_refraction","Dealkalization","Glass","Chemically_strengthened_glass","Alkali_anion_exchange_membrane","Ion-exchange_resin"]}
