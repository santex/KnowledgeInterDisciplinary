{"cursor":"5828","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Chemical similarity' (or 'molecular similarity') refers to the similarity of\nchemical elements, molecules or chemical compounds with respect to either\nstructural or functional qualities, i.e. the effect that the chemical compound\nhas on reaction partners in anorganic or biological settings. Biological effects\nand thus also similarity of effects are usually quantified using the biological\nactivity of a compound. In general terms, function can be related to the\nchemical activity of compounds (among others).\n\nThe notion of chemical similarity (or molecular similarity) is one of the most\nimportant concepts in chemoinformatics. It plays an important role in modern approaches to\npredicting the properties of chemical compounds, designing chemicals with a\npredefined set of properties and, especially, in conducting drug design studies\nby screening large databases containing structures of available (or potentially\navailable) chemicals. These studies are based on the similar property principle\nof Johnson and Maggiora, which states: similar compounds have similar\nproperties.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Chemical_similarity","recorded":1362671831,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cheminformatics","Drug discovery","Chemistry"],"headings":["Similarity Measures","Similarity Search and Virtual Screening","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_element","Molecule","Chemical_compound","Chemical_structure","Chemical_reaction","Biological_activity","Chemical_activity","Chemoinformatics","Inverse_element","Distance","Euclidean_distance","Triangle_inequality","Virtual_screening","Jaccard_index","QSAR"]}
