For example, a liquid may become gas upon\nheating to the boiling point, resulting in an abrupt change in volume. The\nmeasurement of the external conditions at which the transformation occurs is\ntermed the ''phase transition.\n\nPhase transitions are common occurrences observed in nature and many engineering\ntechniques exploit certain types of phase transition.\n\nThe term is most commonly used to describe transitions between solid, liquid and\ngaseous states of matter, and, in rare cases, plasma.\n",
