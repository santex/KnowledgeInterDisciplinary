{"cursor":"11347","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn single-winner voting system theory, the 'Condorcet loser criterion' is a\nmeasure for differentiating voting systems. It implies the majority loser\ncriterion.\n\nA voting system complying with the Condorcet loser criterion will never allow a\nCondorcet loser to win. A Condorcet loser is a candidate who can be defeated in\na head-to-head competition against each other candidate. (Not all elections will\nhave a Condorcet loser since it is possible for three or more candidates to be\nmutually defeatable in different head-to-head competitions.)\n\nA slightly weaker (easier to pass) version is the majority Condorcet loser\ncriterion, which requires that a candidate who can be defeated by a majority in\na head-to-head competition against each other candidate, lose. It is possible\nfor a system, such as Majority Judgment, which allows voters not to state a\npreference between two candidates, to pass the MCLC but not the CLC.\n\nCompliant methods include: two-round system, instant-runoff voting, contingent\nvote, borda count, Schulze method, ranked pairs, and Kemeny-Young method.\n\nNoncompliant methods include: plurality voting, supplementary voting, Sri Lankan\ncontingent voting, approval voting, range voting, Bucklin voting and minimax\nCondorcet.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Condorcet_loser","recorded":1362566151,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Voting system criteria"],"headings":["Examples","Ranked Pairs","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Tennessee_map_for_voting_example.svg/500px-Tennessee_map_for_voting_example.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Voting_system","Majority_loser_criterion","Voting_system","Condorcet_method","Two-round_system","Instant-runoff_voting","Contingent_vote","Borda_count","Schulze_method","Ranked_pairs","Kemeny-Young_method","Plurality_voting","Approval_voting","Range_voting","Bucklin_voting","Minimax_Condorcet","Condorcet_method","Condorcet_criterion"]}
