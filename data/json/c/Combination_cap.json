In the United States\nmilitary, they are commonly known as 'service caps', 'wheel caps', 'saucer\ncaps,' or 'combination covers' in the Naval services.\n\nThe cap has a crown, a band, and a peak (British English) or visor (American\nEnglish). The crown is one color, often white for navies, light blue for air\nforces, and green for armies, and may be piped around the edge in a different\ncolor. The band can be one color, often black, or can be striped, vertically or\nhorizontally. Most caps have some form of cap device (or cap badge). In the\nBritish Army, each regiment and corps has a different badge. In the American\narmed forces, the cap device is uniform throughout the branch of service, though\ndifferent variants are used by different rank classes. The peak or visor is\nshort, historically made of leather, or in newer caps may be a shiny plastic.\nSometimes it is covered in fabric and may be adorned with embroidered\nornamentation.\n","linknr":457,"url":"Combination_cap","recorded":1362566487,"links":39,"instances":["israel","rank","united_states","united_kingdom","sphinx_special_observation_post_battery_ra","united_states","1992","united_states","military","united_kingdom","united_states","united_kingdom","uniform","nautical","armed_forces","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caps","Russian
