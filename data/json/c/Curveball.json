{"cursor":"14760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'curveball' is a type of pitch in baseball thrown with a characteristic\ngrip and hand movement that imparts forward spin to the ball causing it to dive\nin a downward path as it approaches the plate. Its close relatives are the\nslider and the slurve. The \"curve\" of the ball varies from pitcher to pitcher.\nOutside the context of baseball, variants of the expression \"to throw a\ncurveball\" essentially translate to introducing a significant deviation to a\npreceding concept.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Curveball","recorded":1362552604,"links":23,"instances":["baseball","baseball","object","baseball"],"pdf":["http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/pdf/pitchingpage.pdf"],"categories":["Aerodynamics","Baseball pitches","Baseball plays"],"headings":["Grip and action","The 12–6 curveball vs. The \"slurve\"","Physics of a curveball","Real or illusion?","Nicknames","History","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/12-6_Curveball.gif/200px-12-6_Curveball.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/Baseball_%28crop%29.jpg/29px-Baseball_%28crop%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pitch","baseball"],["baseball","object"],["fred_goldsmith","baseball"],["matt_morris","baseball"]],"members":["fred_goldsmith","matt_morris","baseball","pitch"],"related":["Pitch_(baseball)","Baseball","Baseball_(object)","Slider","Slurve","Four-seam_fastball","Axis_of_rotation","Reel-type_mower","Bowling_ball","MLB","Wild_pitch","Cartilage","Tendon","Ligament","Bicep","Tommy_John_surgery","12–6_curveball","Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis","Slurve","Magnus_effect","Gravity","Knuckleball","Topspin","Optical_illusion","Sikorsky_Aircraft","Baseball_Hall_of_Fame","Dizzy_Dean","Fred_Goldsmith_(baseball)","Candy_Cummings","Capitoline_Grounds","Phonney_Martin","St._Nicholas_Magazine","Bob_Feller","Virgil_Trucks","Herb_Score","Camilo_Pascual","Sandy_Koufax","Barry_Zito","Adam_Wainwright","Sal_Maglie","Dwight_Gooden","Nolan_Ryan","David_Wells","Darryl_Kile","Matt_Morris_(baseball)","Orel_Hershiser","Aaron_Sele","Tommy_Bridges","Bert_Blyleven","Steve_Carlton","Mordecai_Brown"]}
