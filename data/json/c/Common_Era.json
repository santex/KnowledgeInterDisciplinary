{"cursor":"68808","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Common Era' (also 'Current Era'\n\n or 'Christian Era'\n*\n* ), abbreviated as 'CE', is an alternative naming of the traditional\n  calendar era, [[Anno Domini]] (abbreviated AD). {{cite web\n  |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm |title=Controversy over the use\n  of the \"CE/BCE\" and \"AD/BC\" dating notation |publisher=Ontario Consultants on\n  Religious Tolerance |accessdate=2011-11-12}}  'BCE' is the abbreviation\n  for 'Before the Common/Current/Christian Era' (an alternative to Before\n  Christ, abbreviated BC). The CE/BCE designation uses the year-numbering system\n  introduced by the 6th-century Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus, who started\n  the Anno Domini designation, intending the beginning of the life of Jesus to\n  be the reference date.\n\n\n\n Neither notation includes a year zero, Two separate systems that\nalso do not use religious titles, the astronomical system and the ISO 8601\nstandard do use a year zero. The year 1 BCE (identical to the year 1 BC) is\nrepresented as 0 in the astronomical system, and as 0000 in ISO 8601. Presently,\nISO 8601 dating requires use of the Gregorian calendar for all dates, however;\nwhereas astronomical dating and Common Era dating allow use of the Julian\ncalendar for dates before 1582 CE.  and the two notations (CE/BCE and\nAD/BC) are numerically equivalent; thus \" CE\" corresponds to \"AD \" and \"399 BCE\"\ncorresponds to \"399 BC\".\n\nThe expression \"Common Era\" can be found as early as 1708 in English, and traced back to Latin usage among European\nChristians to 1615, as vulgaris aerae, and to 1635 in\nEnglish as Vulgar Era. At those times, the expressions were all used\ninterchangeably with \"Christian Era\", and \"vulgar\" meant \"not regal\" rather than\n\"crudely indecent\". Use of the CE abbreviation was introduced by Jewish\nacademics in the mid-19th century. Since the later 20th century, use of CE and\nBCE has been popularized in academic and scientific publications, and more\ngenerally by publishers emphasizing secularism or sensitivity to non-Christians.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar, and the year-numbering system associated with it, is the\ncalendar system with most widespread use in the world today. For decades, it has\nbeen the global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the\nUnited Nations and the Universal Postal Union.\n\nThe CE/BCE notation has been adopted by numerous authors and publishers wishing\nto be neutral or sensitive to non-Christians {{cite book\n|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-\nVLt0uQrzXMC&pg=PA18&dq=before+common+era+christian+non-christian |title=Get Set\nfor Religious Studies |publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|author1=Corrywright, Dominic |author2=Morgan, Peggy |year=2006 |isbn=0-7486-2032-\nX |isbn=978-0-7486-2032-6 |page=18 |quote=Also note where AD (from the Latin 'in\nthe year of our Lord') and BC (before Christ) are used in datings, for although\nthe numerical calculation of this system is now the international convention,\nthe terminology used in religious studies is CE (common era) and BCE (before the\ncommon era), which are more neutrally descriptive terms |accessdate=2011-05-18}}\n\n\n because it does not explicitly make use of religious titles for Jesus,\nsuch as \"Christ\" and Domin- (\"Lord\"), which are used in the BC/AD notation, nor\ndoes it give implicit expression to the Christian creed that Jesus was the\nChrist.
