{"cursor":"21012","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Patent claims' are the part of a patent or patent application that defines the\nscope of protection granted by the patent. The claims define, in technical\nterms, the extent of the protection conferred by a patent, or the protection\nsought in a patent application. The claims are of the utmost importance both\nduring prosecution and litigation.\n\nFor instance, a claim could read:\n* \"An apparatus for catching mice, said apparatus comprising a base for\n  placement on a surface, a spring member...\"\n* \"A chemical composition for cleaning windows, said composition comprising\n  10â15% ammonia, ...\"\n* \"Method for computing future life expectancies, said method comprising\n  gathering data including X, Y, Z, ...\"\n\nA patent is a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or offering\nfor sale the subject matter defined by the claims. In order to exclude someone\nfrom using a patented invention in a court, the patent owner, or patentee, needs\nto demonstrate that what the other person is using falls within the scope of a\nclaim of the patent. Therefore, it is more valuable to obtain claims that\ninclude the minimal set of limitations that differentiate an invention over what\ncame before, i.e. the so-called prior art. On the other hand, the fewer the\nlimitations in a claim, the more likely it is that the claim will cover or \"read\non\" what came before and be rejected during examination or found to be invalid\nat a later time for lack of novelty.\n","linknr":224,"url":"Claim_(patent)","recorded":1362535292,"links":19,"instances":["patent","engineering","patent"],"pdf":["http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/patents/Patent_Act_of_1836.pdf","http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/pdf/t110443eu1.pdf","http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/classifications/ipc/en/guide/guide_ipc_2009.pdf","http://www.european-patent-office.org/epo/pubs/oj003/07_03/se2_07_03.pdf"],"categories":["Patent law"],"headings":["History","Requirements and structure","Interpretation or claim construction","Basic types and categories","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["novelty","patent"],["novelty","patent"],["nail","engineering"],["disclaimer","patent"]],"members":["disclaimer","nail","novelty"],"related":["Patent","Patent_application","Patent_prosecution","Lawsuit","Surface","Prior_art","Novelty_(patent)","Europe","Invention","Inventor","Technology","Patent_attorney","Novelty_(patent)","Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness","Patent_infringement","Germany","Continental_Europe","United_Kingdom","United_States","Japan","Doctrine_of_equivalents","Filing_date","European_Patent_Convention","Nail_(engineering)","Rivet","Fastener","Transitional_phrase","Lexicographer","Sufficiency_of_disclosure","Markman_hearing","Public_Patent_Foundation","Patent_examiner","Priority_right","Doctrine_of_claim_differentiation","European_Patent_Convention","USPTO","Method_claim","Claims_under_the_European_Patent_Convention","Clearance_search_and_opinion","Disclaimer_(patent)","Doctrine_of_equivalents","European_Patent_Judges'_Symposium"]}
