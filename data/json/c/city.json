Oil\nand tempera painting (c1480). Panel in the Walters Art Museum]] A 'city' is a\nrelatively large and permanent settlement.<ref name=\"Goodall\">Goodall, B. (1987)\nThe Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.</ref><ref\nname=\"Kuper and Kuper\">Kuper, A. and Kuper, J., eds (1996)The Social Science\nEncyclopedia''. 2nd edition. London: Routledge.</ref> Although there is no\nagreement on how a city is distinguished from a town within general English\nlanguage meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or\nhistorical status based on local law.\n\nFor example, in the American state of Massachusetts an article of incorporation\napproved by the local state legislature distinguishes a city government from a\ntown. In the United Kingdom and parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, a city is\nusually a settlement with a royal charter.<ref name=\"Goodall\"/> Historically, in\nEurope, a city was understood by some to mean an urban settlement with a\ncathedral. The belief in this distinction is also common in England, where the\npresence of a cathedral is thought by many to distinguish a 'city' (sometimes\ncalled a 'cathedral city') from a 'town' (which has a parish church); the belief\nis incorrect (Chelmsford, for example, became a city only in 2012, but had a\ncathedral for most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century).\n\nCities generally have complex systems for sanitation, utilities, land usage,\nhousing, and transportation. The concentration of development greatly\nfacilitates interaction between people and businesses, benefiting both parties\nin the process. A big city or metropolis usually has associated suburbs and\nexurbs. Such cities are usually associated with metropolitan areas and urban\nareas, creating numerous business commuters traveling to urban centers for\nemployment. Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region\ncan be deemed a conurbation or megalopolis.\n","title":"city","headings":["Origins","Geography","History","External
