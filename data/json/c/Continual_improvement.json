These efforts can seek \"incremental\"\nimprovement over time or \"breakthrough\" improvement all at once. ASQ: Learn\nAbout Quality â€” http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/continuous-\nimprovement/overview/overview.html Delivery (customer valued) processes\nare constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency,\neffectiveness and flexibility.\n\nSome see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems (such as business\nprocess management, quality management, project management, and program\nmanagement). W. Edwards Deming, a pioneer of the field, saw it as part of the\n'system' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against\norganisational goals. The fact that it can be called a management process does\nnot mean that it needs to be executed by 'management'; but rather merely that it\nmakes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design\nof the delivery process itself.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Continual_improvement","recorded":1362551710,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Japanese business terms","Lean concepts"],"headings":["Kaizen","Implementation","Continual improvement in environmental management","\"Continuous\" versus \"continual\"","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Business_process_management","Quality_management","Project_management","Program_management","W._Edwards_Deming","Kaizen","Masaaki_Imai","Facila","Lifelong_Learning","Environmental_management_system","ISO_14000","Eco-Management_and_Audit_Scheme","ISO_14000","Kaizen","Linguistic_prescription","Continuous_function","Quantum","Linguistic_corpus","International_Organization_for_Standardization","ISO_9000","ISO_14000","Benchmarking","Kaizen","Training_Within_Industry","ISO_14000","ISO/IEC_15504"]}
