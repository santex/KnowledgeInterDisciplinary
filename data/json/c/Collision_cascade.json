The initial energetic atom can be, e.g., an ion from a particle\naccelerator, an atomic recoil produced by a passing high-energy neutron,\nelectron or photon, or be produced when a radioactive nucleus decays and gives\nthe atom a recoil energy.\n\nThe nature of collision cascades can vary strongly depending on the energy and\nmass of the recoil/incoming ion and density of the material (stopping power).\n","linknr":382,"url":"Collision_cascade","recorded":1362544231,"links":20,"instances":["particle_radiation","irradiation","journal"],"pdf":["http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jun252001/1560.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jun252001/1560.pdf","http://www.swamp.tec.ufl.edu/images/JApplPhys_81_6513.pdf","http://www.swamp.tec.ufl.edu/images/JApplPhys_81_6513.pdf"],"categories":["Condensed matter physics","Radiation effects"],"headings":["Linear cascades","Heat spikes (thermal spikes)","Time scale","Effects","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/10kevau_au.gif/220px-10kevau_au.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Bca_collisions.png/220px-Bca_collisions.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Linearcollisioncascade.png/220px-Linearcollisioncascade.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Heatspikecollisioncascade.png/220px-Heatspikecollisioncascade.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Cascade_sequence.png/220px-Cascade_sequence.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stopping_power","particle_radiation"],["stopping_power","particle_radiation"],["pka","irradiation"],["nature","journal"],["stopping_power","particle_radiation"],["stopping_power","particle_radiation"]],"members":["stopping_power","pka","nature"],"related":["Gold","KeV","Kinetic_energy","KeV","Atom","Academic_Press","Cambridge_University_Press","Threshold_displacement_energy","Electronvolt","Crystallographic_defect","Ion","Particle_accelerator","Neutron","Electron","Photon","Stopping_power_(particle_radiation)","Stopping_power","Binary_collision_approximation","Stopping_and_Range_of_Ions_in_Matter","GeV","Stopping_power_(particle_radiation)","PKA_(Irradiation)","Threshold_displacement_energy","Molecular_dynamics","Physical_Review","Youtube.com","Academic_Press","Interstitial_defect","Crystallographic_defect","Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution","Physical_Review_Letters","Nature_(journal)","Copper","Stopping_power_(particle_radiation)","Nuclear_Instruments_and_Methods_in_Physics_Research_Section_B","Physical_Review_B","Swift_heavy_ion","Stopping_power_(particle_radiation)","Physical_Review_B","Physical_Review_Letters","Coulomb_explosion","Physical_Review_Letters","Ion_tracks","Current_Science","Physical_Review_Letters","Applied_Physics_A","Threshold_displacement_energy","Physical_Review_Letters","Electron-phonon_coupling","Physical_Review_B","Crystallographic_defect","Point_defect","Dislocation","Crystallographic_defect","Crystallographic_defect","Crystallographic_defect","Dislocation","Applied_Physics_Letters","Amorphous","Philosophical_Magazine_A","Ion_implantation","Silicon_chip","Journal_of_Applied_Physics","Semiconductor","Quantum_well","Journal_of_Physics_D","Nature_Materials","Sputtering","Physical_Review_Letters","Philosophical_Magazine_A","Physical_Review_Letters","Physical_Review_Letters","Ion_beam_mixing","Nuclear_Instruments_and_Methods_in_Physics_Research_Section_B","Particle_shower","COSIRES_conference","REI_conference"]}
