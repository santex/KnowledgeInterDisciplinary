{"cursor":"5827","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Channel Ports' are seaports in southern England and the facing continent,\nwhich allow for short crossings of the English Channel. There is no formal\ndefinition, but there is a general understanding of the term. Some ferry\ncompanies divide their routes into \"short\" and \"long\" crossings. The broadest\ndefinition might be from Plymouth east to Kent and from Roscoff to Zeebrugge\nalthough a tighter definition would exclude ports west of Newhaven and Dieppe. A\nhistoric group of such ports is the Cinque Ports of south-east England, most of\nwhich have ceased to be commercial ports. {{cite web\n | last = first = authorlink = coauthors = title = Channel Ferry Ports linking\n | England and France work = publisher = visitFrance date = 2002-2009 url =\n | http://www.visitfrance.co.uk/channel_ferries.cfm doi = accessdate = 15 July\n | 2009 }}\n","linknr":166,"url":"Channel_ports","recorded":1362538066,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ports and harbours of England","Ports and harbours of France","Ports and harbours of the English Channel"],"headings":["Ports","Strategic importance","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Dover_from_air.jpg/240px-Dover_from_air.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["English_Channel","Plymouth","Kent","Roscoff","Zeebrugge","Newhaven,_East_Sussex","Dieppe,_Seine-Maritime","Cinque_Ports","Dover","Hinterland","Channel_Tunnel","Sussex","Folkestone","Calais","Newhaven,_East_Sussex","Dieppe,_Seine-Maritime","Ramsgate","Ostende","Portsmouth","Poole","Weymouth,_Dorset","Plymouth","Normandy","Brittany","Spain","Dunkirk","Le_Havre","Caen","Cherbourg","Roscoff","St_Malo","Rosslare_Europort","Cobh","Ostend","Zeebrugge","Rosyth_â€“_Zeebrugge_ferry_service","Industrial_action","Strike_action","Blockade","World_War_I","Materiel","John_Jellicoe,_1st_Earl_Jellicoe","Douglas_Haig,_1st_Earl_Haig","Flanders","Battle_of_Passchendaele","Dunkirk","Calais","Dunkirk_evacuation","First_Canadian_Army","Operation_Fusilade","Operation_Astonia","Operation_Wellhit","Operation_Undergo"]}
