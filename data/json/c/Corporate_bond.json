(The term \"commercial paper\" is\n  | sometimes used for instruments with a shorter maturity.)\n\nSometimes, the term \"corporate bonds\" is used to include all bonds except those\nissued by governments in their own currencies. Strictly speaking, however, it\nonly applies to those issued by corporations. The bonds of local authorities and\nsupranational organizations do not fit in either category.\n\nCorporate bonds are often listed on major exchanges (bonds there are called\n\"listed\" bonds) and ECNs, and the coupon (i.e. interest payment) is usually\ntaxable. Sometimes this coupon can be zero with a high redemption value.\nHowever, despite being listed on exchanges, the vast majority of trading volume\nin corporate bonds in most developed markets takes place in decentralized, dealer-\nbased, over-the-counter markets.\n\nSome corporate bonds have an embedded call option that allows the issuer to\nredeem the debt before its maturity date. Other bonds, known as convertible\nbonds, allow investors to convert the bond into equity.\n\nCorporate Credit spreads may alternatively be earned in exchange for default\nrisk through the mechanism of Credit Default Swaps which give an unfunded\nsynthetic exposure to similar risks on the same 'Reference Entities'. However,\nowing to quite volatile CDS 'basis' the spreads on CDS and the credit spreads on\ncorporate bonds can be significantly different.\n","linknr":416,"url":"Corporate_bond","recorded":1362555830,"links":29,"instances":["finance","finance","finance","bond"],"pdf":["http://www.vietnamica.net/op/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/VuongTran.JEPR_.Vol6_.No1_.2011.pdf","http://www.vietnamica.net/op/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/VuongTran.JEPR_.Vol6_.No1_.2011.pdf"],"categories":["Commercial bonds"],"headings":["Types","Risk analysis","Other risks in Corporate Bonds","Corporate bond indices","Corporate bond market transparency","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg/135px-Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bond","finance"],["coupon","bond"],["over-the-counter","finance"],["default","finance"]],"members":["bond","default","coupon"],"related":["Bond_(finance)","Corporation","Government","Stock_exchange","Electronic_communication_network","Coupon_(bond)","Interest","Tax","Over-the-counter_(finance)","Call_option","Convertible_bond","Secured_debt","Unsecured_debt","Senior_debt","Subordinated_debt","Capital_structure","Government_bond","Default_(finance)","Probability_of_default","Yield","Bond_index"]}
