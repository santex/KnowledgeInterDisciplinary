All objects in the\n observer's sky can be thought of as projected upon the inside surface of the\n celestial sphere, as if it were the underside of a dome or a hemispherical\n screen. The celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy,\n allowing observers to plot positions of objects in the sky when their distances\n are unknown or unimportant.\n","linknr":289,"url":"Celestial_sphere","recorded":1362672302,"links":73,"instances":["graphical","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Celestial coordinate system","Spherical astronomy"],"headings":["Introduction","Celestial coordinate systems","History","Star globe","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Earth_within_celestial_sphere.gif/200px-Earth_within_celestial_sphere.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/JostBurgi-MechanisedCelestialGlobe1594.jpg/220px-JostBurgi-MechanisedCelestialGlobe1594.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["direction","geometry"],["point","geometry"],["centre","geometry"],["parallel","geometry"],["line","geometry"],["perspective","graphical"],["parallel","geometry"],["plane","geometry"]],"members":["perspective","direction","plane","point","parallel","line","centre"],"related":["Ecliptic","Right_ascension","Declination","Equatorial_coordinate_system","Astronomy","Navigation","Imagination","Sphere","Radius","Concentric","Sky","Projective_geometry","Dome","Projection_screen","Spherical_astronomy","Sky","Sphere","Diurnal_motion","Earth's_rotation","Spherical_astronomy","Direction_(geometry)","Infinity","Radius","Point_(geometry)","Centre_(geometry)","Parallel_(geometry)","Line_(geometry)","Millimetre","Solar_System","Vanishing_point","Perspective_(graphical)","Parallel_(geometry)","Plane_(geometry)","Great_circle","Moon","Earth","Parallax","Astronomer","Geocentric_coordinates","Geometry","Astronomy","Shorthand","Moon","Terrestrial_Time","Equatorial_coordinate_system","Right_ascension","Declination","Eclipse","Celestial_coordinate_system","Earth","Equator","Earth's_rotation","Earth's_orbit","Celestial_equator","Celestial_pole","Ecliptic","Celestial_coordinate_system","Longitude","Latitude","Equatorial_coordinate_system","Right_ascension","Declination","Celestial_equator","Celestial_pole","Ecliptic_coordinate_system","Celestial_longitude","Celestial_latitude","Aristotle","Ptolemy","Classical_planets","Celestial_spheres","Fixed_stars","Plato","Farnese_Atlas","Hellenistic_period","Celestial_coordinate_system","Celestial_spheres","Firmament","History_of_astronomy","Sky","Spherical_astronomy","National_Imagery_and_Mapping_Agency"]}
