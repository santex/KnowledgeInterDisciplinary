He also played on the inaugural\nNational League pennant-winning team, the 1876 Chicago White Stockings.\n\nHe has the NA record for most career RBIs (276)\n\n\nCal McVey was born in rural Montrose, Iowa and moved to Indianapolis at eleven,\nwhere he learned baseball and soon excelled at the game, playing for the Western\nand Active clubs in the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP). With\nMcVey usually pitching, the Actives in 1868 defeated local rivals, lost to the\nthree strong Eastern teams that toured the West, and won one game in six against\nCincinnati teams (Wright 2000: 211). Despite a lopsided 7â54 defeat by the\nCincinnati Red Stockings, that club later hired him to play in 1869 for $700 and\nhe served as the regular right fielder for both of its storied seasons. On a\ntrip to Cincinnati, September 14 to 17, the Actives played four games in four\ndays (Wright 2000: 211). The local baseball fraternity must have followed the\nActives as well as the relative performances of the four local teams, all\nwinners. Perhaps Red Stockings manager Harry Wright watched all the games\nhimself.\n","linknr":233,"url":"Cal_McVey","recorded":1362892240,"links":17,"instances":["baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Major League Baseball catchers","Major League Baseball first basemen","Major League Baseball outfielders","Cincinnati Red Stockings players","Boston Red Stockings players","Baltimore Canaries players","Baltimore Canaries managers","Chicago White Stockings players","Cincinnati Reds (1876–1880) players","Cincinnati Reds (1876–1880) managers","Baseball players from Iowa","People from Lee County, Iowa","Major League Baseball player–managers","19th-century baseball players","1849 births","1926 deaths","San Francisco Bay City players","San Francisco Californias players"],"headings":["Cincinnati","1871","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Cal_McVey.jpg/200px-Cal_McVey.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cincinnati_reds","1876-1880"],["cincinnati_reds","1876-1880"],["cincinnati_reds","1876-1880"],["hit","baseball"],["pitch","baseball"],["out","baseball"],["forfeit","baseball"],["cincinnati_reds","1876-1880"]],"members":["forfeit","out","pitch","hit","cincinnati_reds"],"related":["First_Baseman","Catcher","Outfielder","Montrose,_Iowa","San_Francisco,_California","Cincinnati_Reds_(1876-1880)","Batting_average","Runs_scored","Runs_batted_in","Cincinnati_Red_Stockings","Baltimore_Canaries","Chicago_Cubs","Cincinnati_Reds_(1876-1880)","Baltimore_Canaries","Cincinnati_Reds_(1876-1880)","Hit_(baseball)","Baseball","Cincinnati_Red_Stockings","National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players","National_League","Chicago_Cubs","RBIs","Montrose,_Iowa","Indianapolis","National_Association_of_Base_Ball_Players","Cincinnati_Red_Stockings","Cincinnati_Red_Stockings","1869_in_baseball","1870_in_baseball","Foul_ball","Pitch_(baseball)","Catcher","Out_(baseball)","Forfeit_(baseball)","Harry_Wright","National_Association_of_Professional_Base_Ball_Players","Deacon_White","Cap_Anson","Chicago_Cubs","Deacon_White","Ross_Barnes","Albert_Spalding","National_League","Cap_Anson","1878_in_baseball","Cincinnati_Reds_(1876-1880)","List_of_Major_League_Baseball_saves_champions","List_of_Major_League_Baseball_RBI_champions","List_of_Major_League_Baseball_runs_scored_champions","List_of_Major_League_Baseball_doubles_champions","List_of_Major_League_Baseball_player–managers"]}
