Unlike the protonâproton chain reaction, the CNO cycle is a\ncatalytic cycle. Theoretical models show that the CNO cycle is the dominant\nsource of energy in stars more massive than about 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.\nThe protonâproton chain is more important in stars the mass of the Sun or less.\nThis difference stems from temperature dependency differences between the two\nreactions; pp-chain reactions start occurring at temperatures around\n, {{citation\n | first1=I.
