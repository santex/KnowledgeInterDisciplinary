{"cursor":"13230","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cooperative breeding' is a social system in which individuals contribute care\nto offspring that are not their own at the expense of their own\nreproduction. When reproduction is monopolized by one or few of the\nadult group members and most adults do not reproduce, but help rear the\nbreederâs offspring, the majority of these cooperative breeding species exhibit\nhigh reproductive skew. However, there are plural breeding species with low\nreproductive skew, in which the subordinates commonly breed. This kind of\ncooperative breeding systems is particularly rare and includes communal\nbreeding, in which more than one female lays eggs or gives birth to\nyoung. 5. Gilchrist, Jason. 2006. Cooperative behaviour in cooperative\nbreeders: costs, benefits, and communal breeding. Behavioural Processes 76: 100-\n105. Cooperative breeding is different from alloparenting, which is simply\nthe act of caring completely for another conspecific's offspring but not at\ntheir own expense.\n","linknr":200,"url":"Cooperative_breeding","recorded":1362686380,"links":17,"instances":["cultural_anthropology","biology","biology","animal_behavior"],"pdf":["http://www.columbia.edu/~dr2497/PUBLICATIONS_files/Jetz%26RubensteinCB.pdf","http://www.columbia.edu/~dr2497/PUBLICATIONS_files/Jetz%26RubensteinCB.pdf","http://personal.lse.ac.uk/sear/pdfs/are%20human%20cooperative%20breeders.pdf"],"categories":["Helping","Ecological processes","Sociobiology","Ethology"],"headings":["Evolution","Benefits of Cooperative Breeding","Costs of Cooperative Breeding","Biological Examples","Primates","See also","Sources","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Suricata.suricatta.with.young.2.jpg/220px-Suricata.suricatta.with.young.2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fitness","biology"],["mutualism","biology"],["reciprocity","evolution"],["mobbing","animal_behavior"],["reciprocity","cultural_anthropology"]],"members":["reciprocity","mutualism","fitness","mobbing"],"related":["Social_system","Offspring","Reproduction","Communal_breeding","Alloparenting","Birds","Mammals","Kinship","Kin_selection","Evolution","Societies","Social_animals","Unrelated","Fitness_(biology)","Mutualism_(biology)","Reciprocity_(evolution)","Iterated_prisoner's_dilemma","Group_augmentation","Mobbing_(animal_behavior)","Reciprocity_(cultural_anthropology)","Coraciiformes","Piciformes","Songbirds","Sylvioidea","Australian_mudnester","Australo-Papuan_babbler","Ground_hornbill","Azure-winged_magpie","Australia","Sub-Saharan_Africa","Meerkat","Alpha","Reproduction","Mating_system","Breeding_season"]}
