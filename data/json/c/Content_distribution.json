Digital distribution bypasses conventional\nphysical distribution methods, such as paper or DVDs. The term online\ndistribution is typically applied to freestanding products; downloadable add-ons\nfor other products are more commonly known as downloadable content. With the\nadvancement of network bandwidth capabilities, digital distribution became\nprominent in the 2000s.\n\nContent distributed online may be streamed or downloaded. Streaming involves\ndownloading and using content \"on-demand\" as it is needed. Meanwhile, fully\ndownloading the content to a hard drive or other form of storage media allows\nfor quick access in the future.\n\nSpecialist networks known as content delivery networks help distribute digital\ncontent over the Internet by ensuring both high availability and high\nperformance. Alternative technologies for content delivery include peer-to-peer\nfile sharing technologies. Content can only be delivered if it exists on a\ncomputer that another user has made available to others. If it does not exist,\nseveral techniques and methods can be used for content creation or content\nregeneration. Alternatively, content delivery platforms create and syndicate\ncontent remotely, acting like hosted content management systems. \n","linknr":485,"url":"Content_distribution","recorded":1362484217,"links":42,"instances":["business","communication","media","business"],"pdf":["http://www.keanet.eu/docs/impactondigitaldistribution.pdf","http://www.keanet.eu/docs/impactondigitaldistribution.pdf"],"categories":["Video game development","Digital rights management","E-commerce","Online content distribution|"],"headings":["Basis","Impact on traditional retail","Differences between traditional and digital retailers","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ambox_outdated_content.svg/42px-Ambox_outdated_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["media","communication"],["content","media"],["distribution","business"],["overhead","business"]],"members":["overhead","media","content","distribution"],"related":["Media_(communication)","Content_(media)","Sound_recording_and_reproduction","Motion_graphics","Software","Video_game","Internet","Paper","DVD","Downloadable_content","Streaming_media","Hard_drive","Content_delivery_network","Peer-to-peer","File_sharing","Content_delivery_platform","Content_management_system","Book","Film","Music","Software","Television_program","Video_game","Artist","Publishing","Advertise","Funding","Distribution_(business)","Retail","Overhead_(business)","Consumer","Digital_rights_management","Open_Music_Model","Micropayment","Gunbound","Online_music_store","IPlayer","United_Kingdom","Sam_the_Record_Man","The_Toronto_Star","MP3","YouTube","TiVo","Nintendo","Wii","Microsoft","Xbox_360","Sony","PlayStation_3","Hard_drive","Perseus_Books_Group","Independent_Publishers_Group","Online_newspaper","ITunes","Long_Tail","Bel_Air_Circuit","Cloud_gaming","Comparison_of_online_music_stores","Content_delivery_network","Digital_distribution_in_video_games","E-book","Electronic_commerce","Film_distribution","Film_distributor","Internet_pornography","List_of_Internet_television_providers","List_of_mobile_software_distribution_platforms","Streaming_media","Video_on_demand"]}
