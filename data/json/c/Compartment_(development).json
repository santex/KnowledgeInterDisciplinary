{"cursor":"20782","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Compartments can be simply defined as separate, different, adjacent cell\npopulations, which upon juxtaposition, create a lineage boundary. This boundary prevents cell movement from cells from\ndifferent lineages across this barrier, restricting them to their\n'compartment'. Subdivisions are established by\nmorphogen gradients and maintained by local cell-cell interactions, providing\nfunctional units with domains of different regulatory genes, which give rise to\ndistinct fates. Compartment boundaries are found across\nspecies. In the hindbrain of vertebrate embryos, rhobomeres are compartments of\ncommon lineage  outlined by expression of Hox\ngenes. In invertebrates, the wing imaginal disc of\n[[Drosophila]] provides an excellent model for the study of compartments.\nAlthough other tissues, such as the abdomen, and even\nother imaginal discs are compartmentalized, much of our understanding of key\nconcepts and molecular mechanisms involved in compartment boundaries has been\nderived from experimentation in the wing disc of the fruit fly.\n","linknr":428,"url":"Compartment_(development)","recorded":1362568283,"links":11,"instances":["gene","physics","cell_biology","biology","biology","biology","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology"],"headings":["Function","Cell Separation","Central Dogma","A/P Boundary","Cell Segregation","Future Directions","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["regeneration","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["clone","cell_biology"],["engrailed","gene"],["engrailed","gene"],["clone","cell_biology"],["tension","physics"],["tension","physics"],["cdh1","gene"]],"members":["engrailed","tension","clone","tissue","regeneration","cell","cdh1"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Morphogen","Cell-cell_interaction","Regulator_gene","Cell_fate_determination","Species","Rhombencephalon","Vertebrate","Embryo","Rhombomere","Hox_gene","Invertebrate","Imaginal_disc","Tissue_(biology)","Molecular_biology","Drosophila_melanogaster","Cell_fate_determination","Pattern_formation","Cell_growth","Morphogen","Developmental_biology","Regeneration_(biology)","Cell_growth","Pattern_formation","Heredity","Homeotic_selector_gene","Heredity","Morphogen","Homeotic_selector_gene","Cell_fate_determination","Signal_transduction","Signal_transduction","Cell_growth","Pattern_formation","Tissue_(biology)","Clone_(cell_biology)","Drosophila_embryogenesis","Blastoderm","Engrailed_(gene)","Homeotic_selector_gene","Engrailed_(gene)","Cell_fate_determination","Anatomical_terms_of_location","Imaginal_disc","Clone_(cell_biology)","Ectopic_expression","Regional_specification","Hedgehog_signaling_pathway","Decapentaplegic","Decapentaplegic","Ci_protein","Signal_transduction","Adhesion","Cell_adhesion_molecule","Homeotic_selector_gene","Hedgehog_signaling_pathway","Smoothened","Adhesion_molecules","Tension_(physics)","Myosin","Anatomical_terms_of_location","Anatomical_terms_of_location","Cytoskeleton","Myosin-heavy-chain_kinase","Rho_kinase","Y-27632","Tension_(physics)","Vertex_model","Adhesion","CDH1_(gene)","Cell_division","Programmed_cell_death","Genetic_screen"]}
