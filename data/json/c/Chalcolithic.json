The\nCopper Age was originally defined as a transition between the Neolithic and the\nBronze Age.\n\nAn archaeological site in southeastern Europe (Serbia) contains the oldest\nsecurely dated evidence of copper making at high temperature, from 7,000 years\nago. [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/calendar/articles/20100924\nucl.ac.uk] Copper smelting may have been invented in separate parts of\nAsia and Europe at that time or spread from an\ninitial source by long-distance\ntrade. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2003.10.007\n","linknr":325,"url":"Chalcolithic","recorded":1362373335,"links":73,"instances":["archaeology","archaeologist","geology","process"],"pdf":["http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/history_in_africa/v032/32.1alpern.pdf","http://www.helsinki.fi/~aparpola/tices_50.pdf","http://www.helsinki.fi/~aparpola/tices_50.pdf"],"categories":["Chalcolithic|"],"headings":["Origin of name","Europe","South Asia","East Asia","Africa","Americas","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Los_Millares_recreacion_cuadro.jpg/250px-Los_Millares_recreacion_cuadro.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG/220px-TimnaChalcolithicMine.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["john_evans","archaeologist"],["molding","process"],["artifact","archaeology"]],"members":["artifact","john_evans","rock","molding"],"related":["Iberia","Copper","Rock_(geology)","Latin","Bronze","Bronze_Age","Tin","Copper","Bronze","Neolithic","Archaeological","Southeastern_Europe","Serbia","Independent_discovery","John_Evans_(archaeologist)","Three-age_system","Three-age_system","Tin","Metallurgy","Fertile_Crescent","4th_millennium_BC","Incas","South_America","Mesoamerica","Mexico","Metallurgy_in_pre-Columbian_Mesoamerica","Middle_East","Caucasus","5th_millennium_BC","Early_Bronze_Age","Bronze_Age_Europe","3rd_millenium_BC","Indus_Civilization","Turkmenistan","Iran","Serbia","Europe","Prokuplje","Battle_Axe_culture","Molding_(process)","Ötzi_the_Iceman","Alps","Mondsee_group","Israel","Vila_Nova_de_São_Pedro","Los_Millares","Iberian_Peninsula","Beaker_people","Proto-Indo-Europeans","Varna_Necropolis","Varna_necropolis","South_Asia","Mehrgarh","5th_millennium_BC","Jiangzhai,_Xi'an","Hongshan_culture","Iron_Age","North_Africa","Near_East","Iron_Age","Sub-Saharan","Termit_Massif","Aïr_Mountains","Niger","Alloy","Old_Copper_Complex","Michigan","Wisconsin","United_States","Weapon","Artifact_(archaeology)","Copper_metallurgy_in_Africa","Metallurgy_during_the_Copper_Age_in_Europe","Synoptic_table_of_the_principal_old_world_prehistoric_cultures","Three_age_system","Encyclopaedia_Iranica"]}
