{"cursor":"13635","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The Creation of the Universe (album)}} from a state of gravitational\nsingularity. The origins of that singularity remain unclear.]] 'Cosmogony' (or\n'cosmogeny') is any scientific theory concerning the coming into existence (or\norigin) of either the cosmos (or universe), or the so-called \"reality\" of\nsentient beings. Developing\na complete theoretical model has implications in both the philosophy of science\nand epistemology.\n\nThe Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model of the early\ndevelopment of the universe. The most commonly held view is that the\nuniverse was once a gravitational singularity, which expanded extremely rapidly\nfrom its hot and dense state. While this expansion is well-modeled by the Big\nBang theory, the origins of the singularity remains one of the unsolved problems\nin physics.\n","linknr":539,"url":"Cosmogony","recorded":1362552061,"links":69,"instances":["theory","philosophy","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/Cosmogony/CosmogonyPDF/CosCosmolTT.pdf"],"categories":["Cosmology","Natural philosophy"],"headings":["Etymology","Overview","Cosmogony compared with cosmology","Epistemological limitations to cosmogony","Theoretical scenarios","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Universe_expansion.png/140px-Universe_expansion.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Calabi-Yau.png/200px-Calabi-Yau.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["membrane","m-theory"],["naturalism","philosophy"],["phenomenology","philosophy"],["continuum","theory"]],"members":["continuum","phenomenology","naturalism","membrane"],"related":["Gravitational_singularity","Scientific_theory","Existence","Cosmos","Universe","Reality","Sentient","Philosophy_of_science","Epistemology","Big_Bang","Physical_cosmology","Scientific_theory","Universe","Gravitational_singularity","Big_Bang","Unsolved_problems_in_physics","Astronomy","Big_Bang","Physical_cosmology","Scientific_theory","Universe","Gravitational_singularity","Big_Bang","Unsolved_problems_in_physics","String_theory","Sean_M._Carroll","Stephen_Hawking","Planck_time","Quantum_gravity","String_theory","M_theory","Loop_quantum_cosmology","Particle_physics","Particle_accelerators","Membrane_(M-theory)","Philosophy_of_science","Epistemology","National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration","Cosmology","Cosmological_argument","Theology","God","Science","Physical_cosmology","Observation","Scientific_method","Metaphysics","Speculation","Extrapolation","Planck_scale","Philosophical","Religious","Naturalism_(philosophy)","Scientific_method","Observation","Principle_of_sufficient_reason","Theism","Deity","First_cause","God_of_the_gaps","Argument_from_ignorance","Nondual","Phenomenology_(philosophy)","Metaphysics","Theism","Paradox","Kierkegaard","Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","Causality","Thomas_Aquinas","Conservation_law","Zeno's_paradoxes","Infinite_regress","Quantum_mechanics","Principle_of_sufficient_reason","String_theory","M_theory","Hartle–Hawking_initial_state","String_landscape","Cosmic_inflation","Ekpyrotic_universe","Big_Bounce","Scientific_model","Universe","Cyclic_model","Big_Bang","Planck_time","Second","Photon","Light","Vacuum","Planck_length","Quantum","Scientific_method","Grand_unified_theories","General_relativity","Quantum_gravity","Superstring","M-theories","Thought_experiment","Quantum_cosmology","Schrödinger","Wave_equation","General_relativity","Quantum_cosmology","Momentum","Hartle–Hawking_state","Differential_of_a_function","Continuum_(theory)","Discrete_mathematics","Digital_physics","Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe"]}
