{"cursor":"2489","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues\n| confusing = April 2011 unreferenced = October 2008\n}}\n\nPhilosophers sometimes distinguish 'classes' from types and kinds. We can talk\nabout the class of human beings, just as we can talk about the type (or natural\nkind), human being, or humanity. How, then, might classes differ from types? One\nmight well think they are not actually different categories of being, but\ntypically, while both are treated as abstract objects, classes are not usually\ntreated as universals, whereas types usually are. Whether natural kinds ought to\nbe considered universals is vexed; see natural kind.\n\nThere is, in any case, a difference in how we talk about types and kinds versus\nhow we talk about classes. We say that Socrates is a [[Type-token\ndistinction|token]] of a type, or an [[Instantiation principle|instance]] of the\nnatural kind, human being. But notice that we say instead that Socrates is a\nmember of the class of human beings. We would not say that Socrates is a\n\"member\" of the type or kind, human beings. Nor would we say he is a type (or\nkind) of a class. He is a token (instance) of the type (kind). So the linguistic\ndifference is: types (or kinds) have tokens (or instances); classes, on the\nother hand, have members.\n\nThere is similarity between the concept of a class, and that of a set defined by\nits members. Here the class is extensional. If, however, a set is defined\nintensionally, then it is a set of things that meet some requirement to be a\nmember. Thus such a set can be seen as creating a type. Note that it also\ncreates a class from the extension of the intensional set. A type always has a\nsimilar class (though that class might have no members), but a class does not\nalways have a corresponding type.\n","linknr":229,"url":"Class_(philosophy)","recorded":1362893027,"links":22,"instances":["metaphysics","metaphysics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophical concepts"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg/30px-Greek_letter_uppercase_Phi.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["type","metaphysics"],["universal","metaphysics"]],"members":["universal","type"],"related":["Philosopher","Type_(metaphysics)","Natural_kind","Category_of_being","Abstract_object","Universal_(metaphysics)","Natural_kind","Socrates","Bertrand_Russell","Principia_Mathematica"]}
