The word can also be used in a more\nlimited sense, means that of cave sediments bivalves, rather than those attached\nto the substrate (such as oysters and mussels), or those who can swim, like\nscallops. In addition, the mussels can be used in a more limited sense, refers\nto one or more varieties of commonly consumed marine bivalves, in the phrase\nclam chowder, which means that shellfish soup usually clams . Many edible\nbivalves are roughly oval-shaped; however, the Pacific razor clam has an\nelongated, parallel-sided shell, the shape of the show, an old-fashioned\nstraight razor.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"clam\" is one of the common names of various species of\nmarine bivalve mollusc, [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/clam?view=uk\nCompact Oxford English Dictionary] but it is not used as a general term\nto cover edible clams that burrow, and it is not used as a general term for\nall bivalves.\n\nNumerous edible marine bivalve species live buried in sand or mud, and respire\nby means of siphons, which reach to the surface. In the United States, these\nclams are collected by \"digging for clams\" or clam digging.\n\nIn October 2007 an [[Arctica islandica]] clam, caught off the coast of Iceland,\nwas discovered to be at least 405 years old, and was declared the world's oldest\nliving animal by researchers from Bangor University; it was later named Ming.\n\nSome species of bivalves are too small to be useful for food and not all species\nare considered palatable.\n\nThe word \"clam\" has given rise to the metaphor \"clam up\", meaning to refuse to\ntalk or answer, based on the clam behavior of quickly closing its shell when\nthreatened. A \"clamshell\" is the name given to a container consisting\nof two hinged halves that lock together. Clams have also inspired the phrase\n\"happy as a clam\", short for \"happy as a clam at high tide\" (which should be\nhappy because it cannot easily be dug up and eaten).\n","linknr":-1,"url":"clam","recorded":1372154297,"links":[],"instances":["clam","container","culture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bivalves","Commercial molluscs","Edible molluscs","Seafood","Mollusc products"],"headings":["Anatomy","As food","Religion","As currency","Species","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["ming","clam"],["clamshell","container"],["moche","culture"]],"members":["ming","clamshell","moche"],"related":["Veneridae","Animal","Mollusca","Bivalvia","Clam_digging","Iceland","Bangor_University","Ming_(clam)","Palatability","Clamshell_(container)","Plankton","Filter_feeder","Hard_clam","Soft-shell_clam","Atlantic","Fried_clams","Clam_chowder","New_England_clam_bake","Endangered_species","Bengal","Karnataka","India","Konkan","Tisaryachi_Ekshipi","Kerala","Masala","Moche_(culture)","Peru","Thames_and_Hudson","Mollusca","Kashrut","Mercenaria_mercenaria","Algonquian_peoples","Wampum","Shell_money","Grooved_carpet_shell","Hard_clam","Soft-shell_Clam","Atlantic_surf_clam","Ocean_quahog","Pacific_razor_clam","Pismo_clam","Pismo_Beach","Geoduck","Atlantic_jackknife_clam","Meretrix_lyrata","Ark_clam","Arcidae","Nut_clam","Pointed_nut_clam","Nuculidae","Duck_clam","Trough_shell","Mactridae","Marsh_clam","Corbiculidae","File_clam","Limidae","Giant_clam","Asian_clam","Peppery_furrow_shell","New_England_clam_bake","Fried_clams","Clam_chowder","Clam_cake","Shipworm","Bivalvia","Science_Daily"]}
