It is used in the context of carbon dioxide releasing\nprocesses associated with transportation, energy production, and industrial\nprocesses such as production of carbon neutral fuel.\n\nThe carbon neutrality concept may be extended to include other greenhouse gases\n(GHG) measured in terms of their carbon dioxide equivalenceâthe impact a GHG has\non the atmosphere expressed in the equivalent amount of CO 2. The term\n'climate neutral' reflects the broader inclusiveness of other greenhouse gases\nin climate change, even if CO is the most abundant, encompassing\nother greenhouse gases regulated by the Kyoto Protocol, namely: methane\n(CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC),\nperfluorocarbons (PFC), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). Both terms\nare used interchangeably throughout this article.\n\nThe best practice for organizations and individuals seeking carbon neutral\nstatus entails reducing and/or avoiding carbon emissions first so that only\nunavoidable emissions are offset. Carbon neutral status is commonly achieved in\ntwo ways: *Balancing carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from burning\nfossil fuels, with renewable energy that creates a similar amount of useful\nenergy, so that the carbon emissions are compensated, or alternatively using\nonly renewable energies that don't produce any carbon dioxide (also called a post-\ncarbon economy).
