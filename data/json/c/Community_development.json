{"cursor":"22736","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Community Development (CD)' is a broad term applied to the practices and\nacademic disciplines of civic leaders, activists, involved citizens and\nprofessionals to improve various aspects of local communities.\n\nCommunity development seeks to empower individuals and groups of people by\nproviding them with the skills they need to effect change in their own\ncommunities. These skills are often created through the formation of large\nsocial groups working for a common agenda. Community developers must understand\nboth how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions\nwithin the context of larger social institutions.\n\nThere are a myriad of job titles for CD workers and their employers include\npublic authorities and voluntary or non-governmental organisations, funded by\nthe state and by independent grant making bodies. Since the nineteen seventies\nthe prefix word âcommunityâ has also been adopted by several other occupations\nfrom the police and health workers to planners and architects, who work with\nmore disadvantaged groups and communities and have been influenced by CD\napproaches.\n\nCD practitioners have over many years developed a range of skills and approaches\nfor working within local communities and in particular with disadvantaged\npeople. These include less formal educational methods, community organising and\ngroup work skills. Since the nineteen sixties and seventies through the various\nanti poverty programmes in both developed and developing countries, CD\npractitioners have been influenced by structural analyses as to the causes of\ndisadvantage and poverty i.e. inequalities in the distribution of wealth,\nincome, land etc and especially political power and the need to mobilise people\npower to affect social change. Thus the influence of such educators as Paulo\nFriere and his focus upon this work also being about politicising the poor.\nOther key people who have influenced this field are Saul Alinsky (Rules for\nRadicals) and EF Schumacher (Small is Beautiful).\n\nThe UK currently hosts the main international body representing community\ndevelopment, the International Association for Community Development. IACD was\nstarted in the USA in 1953, moved to Belgium in the seventies and to the UK\n(Scotland) in 1998. Community development as a term has taken off widely in\nanglophone countries i.e. the USA, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand and\nother countries in the Commonwealth. It is also used in some countries in\neastern Europe with active CD associations in Hungary and Romania. The\nInternational Community Development Journal, published by Oxford University\nPress, and set up in 1967 has been the major forum for research and\ndissemination of international CD theory and practice.\n\nCommunity development approaches are recognised internationally. These methods\nand approaches have been acknowledged as significant for local social, economic,\ncultural, environmental and political development by such organisations as the\nUN, WHO, OECD, World Bank, Council of Europe and EU.\n","linknr":262,"url":"Community_development","recorded":1362477550,"links":20,"instances":["politician","economist","autonomous_community"],"pdf":["http://www.cdf.org.uk/SITE/UPLOAD/DOCUMENT/communitydevelopmentchallenge.pdf","http://www.cdf.org.uk/SITE/UPLOAD/DOCUMENT/communitydevelopmentchallenge.pdf"],"categories":["Urban studies and planning","Community building","Development","Community development"],"headings":["Definitions","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["basque_country","autonomous_community"],["michael_young","politician"],["ronald_ferguson","economist"]],"members":["michael_young","ronald_ferguson","basque_country"],"related":["List_of_academic_disciplines","Social_organization","Community_Development_Foundation","Community_Development_Exchange","Federation_for_Community_Development_Learning","Grassroots_democracy","Community_economic_development","Capacity_building","Social_capital","Civil_society","Direct_Action","Ecologically_sustainable_development","Asset-based_community_development","Faith-based_community","Community_practice","Community-based_participatory_research","Community_Mobilization","Empowerment","Community_Participation","Participatory_planning","Workforce_development","Digital_divide","Digital_inclusion","Online_community","Urban_development","Per_Scholas","Socialist","Robert_Owen","New_Lanark","Oneida_Community","New_Australia_Movement","Utopian","Intentional_utopian_communities","Urban_renewal","Working_class","Ford_Foundation","Robert_F._Kennedy","Bedford-Stuyvesant_Restoration_Corporation","Community_Development_Corporation","Housing_and_Community_Development_Act_of_1974","Non-profit_organization","Neighborhood_Reinvestment_Corporation","NeighborWorks_America","Local_Initiatives_Support_Corporation","Enterprise_Foundation","Nonprofit","Social_development","Types_of_rural_communities","Inner_city","South_Bronx","Credit_union","Antigonish_Movement","Nova_Scotia","Moses_Coady","James_Tompkins","Eastern_Africa","Mahatma_Gandhi","Swaraj","Economic_interdependence","Indian_independence","Vinoba_Bhave","Grassroots","Land_reform","Jawaharlal_Nehru","Arusha_Declaration","Tanzania","Julius_Nyerere","United_Nations","World_Bank_Group","Literacy","Paulo_Freire","Each_One_Teach_One","Frank_Laubach","Serowe_Brigades","Botswana","Community_Business_Ventures","Cooperatives","José_María_Arizmendiarrieta","Mondragón_Cooperative_Corporation","Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)","Compensatory_Education","Education","Open_educational_resources","Michael_Young_(politician)","Alternative_technology","E._F._Schumacher","Permaculture","Bill_Mollison","David_Holmgren","Water_resources","Robert_Putnam","Social_Capital","Muhammad_Yunus","Bangladesh","Grameen_Bank","Microcredit","Nobel_Peace_Prize","Human_Scale_Development","Right_Livelihood_Award","Manfred_Max_Neef","Poverty","Money","Arms_race","Representative_democracy","Social_alienation","Television","Recreation","Synergy","Breastfeeding","Popular_education","Preventive_medicine","Community","Community_education","Community_learning_and_development","Community_building","Community_art","BetterTogether","Community_media","Community_film","Community_organizing","Community_practice","Rural_community_development","Urban_regeneration","Urbanism","Community_engagement","Urban_Planning","Participatory_planning","Ronald_Ferguson_(economist)","Brookings_Institution","Oxford_University_Press","Affordable_housing"]}
