Modern\ncalculators are more portable than most computers, though most PDAs or mobile\nphones are comparable in size to handheld calculators and may soon replace them.\n\nThe first solid state electronic calculator was created in the 1960s, building\non the extensive history of tools such as the abacus, developed around 2000 BC;\nand the mechanical calculator, developed in the 17th century. It was developed\nin parallel with the analog computers of the day.\n\nPocket sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the\ninvention of the microprocessor developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator\ncompany Busicom.\n\nModern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card sized\nmodels to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in\nthe mid-1970s as integrated circuits made their size and cost small. By the end\nof that decade, calculator prices had reduced to a point where a basic\ncalculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.\n\nComputer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive\ncalculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included\nin almost all PDA-type devices (save a few dedicated address book and\ndictionary devices).\n\nIn addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for\nspecific markets; for example, there are scientific calculators which include\ntrigonometric and statistical calculations. Some calculators even have the\nability to do computer algebra. Graphing calculators can be used to graph\nfunctions defined on the real line, or higher dimensional Euclidean space.\n\nIn 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-\npurpose hardware capacity to compute information. This diminished to less than\n0.05% by 2007.
