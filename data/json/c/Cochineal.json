A\nprimarily sessile parasite native to tropical and subtropical South America and\nMexico, this insect lives on cacti in the genus [[Opuntia]], feeding on plant\nmoisture and nutrients.\n\nThe insect produces carminic acid that deters predation by other insects.\nCarminic acid, typically 17â24% of dried insects' weight, can be extracted from\nthe body and eggs then mixed with aluminum or calcium salts to make carmine dye\n(also known as cochineal). [http://sensient-\ntech.com/cosmetics_sku_color/carmine_overview.htm A history of cochineal.\nAccessed Nov. 28, 2009] Carmine is today primarily used as a food\ncolouring and for cosmetics, especially as a lipstick colouring.\n\nThe carmine dye was used in Central America in the 15th century for colouring\nfabrics and became an important export good during the colonial period. After\nsynthetic pigments and dyes such as alizarin were invented in the late 19th\ncentury, natural-dye production gradually diminished. Health fears over\nartificial food additives, however, have renewed the popularity of cochineal\ndyes, and the increased demand has made cultivation of the insect profitable\nagain, with Peru being the largest exporter. In Mexico,\nsome towns in the state of Oaxaca are still working in hand-made\ntextiles. [http://www.teotitlan.com/naturaldyes.htm teotitlan del valle\noaxaca mexico ]\n\nThere are other species in the genus [[Dactylopius]] that can be used to produce\ncochineal extract, but they are extremely difficult to distinguish from D.\ncoccus, even for expert taxonomists, and the latter scientific name (and the\nvernacular \"cochineal insect\") is therefore commonly used when one is actually\nreferring to other biological species. The primary biological distinctions\nbetween species are minor differences in host plant preferences, in addition to\nvery different geographic distributions.\n\n, the predator-deterring substance found in high concentration in cochineal\ninsects.
