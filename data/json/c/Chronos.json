He and his consort, serpentine Ananke (Inevitability),\ncircled the primal world egg in their coils and split it apart to form the\nordered universe of earth, sea and sky. Chronos was confused with, or perhaps\nconsciously identified with, due to the similarity in name, the Titan Cronus\nalready in antiquity, LSJ entry [http://www.perseus.tu-\nfts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*kro%2Fnos\nÎÏÏÎ½Î¿Ï] the identification becoming more widespread during the\nRenaissance, giving rise to the allegory of \"Father Time\" wielding the\nharvesting scythe.\n\nHe was depicted in Greco-Roman mosaics as a man turning the Zodiac Wheel.\nChronos, however, might also be contrasted with the deity Aion as Eternal\nTime Doro Levi, \"Aion,\" Hesperia 13.4 (1944), p. 274.
