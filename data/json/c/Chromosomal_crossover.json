It is\none of the final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs during prophase I\nof meiosis (pachytene) in a process called synapsis. Synapsis begins before the\nsynaptonemal complex develops, and is not completed until near the end of\nprophase I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching\nchromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome.\n\nCrossing over was described, in theory, by Thomas Hunt Morgan. He relied on the\ndiscovery of the Belgian Professor Frans Alfons Janssens of the University of\nLeuven who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it 'chiasmatypie'.\nThe term [[chiasma (genetics)|chiasma]] is linked if not identical to\nchromosomal crossover. Morgan immediately saw the great importance of Janssens'\ncytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his\nresearch on the heredity of [[Drosophila]]. The physical basis of crossing over\nwas first demonstrated by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931.\n(Original paper)\n","linknr":250,"url":"Chromosomal_crossover","recorded":1362567206,"links":48,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular processes","Molecular genetics"],"headings":["Chemistry","Consequences","Problems","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Morgan_crossover_1.jpg/200px-Morgan_crossover_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Morgan_crossover_2.jpg/200px-Morgan_crossover_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Chromosomal_Recombination.svg/220px-Chromosomal_Recombination.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Holliday_Junction.svg/182px-Holliday_Junction.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Holliday_junction.jpg/200px-Holliday_junction.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Conversion_and_crossover.jpg/250px-Conversion_and_crossover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["catholic_university_of_leuven","1834–1968"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["catholic_university_of_leuven","cell"],"related":["Homologous_chromosome","Genetic_recombination","Prophase_I","Meiosis","Synapsis","Synaptonemal_complex","Chromosome","Thomas_Hunt_Morgan","Frans_Alfons_Janssens","Catholic_University_of_Leuven_(1834–1968)","Harriet_Creighton","Barbara_McClintock","Spo11","Exonuclease","Recombinase","Dmc1","Rad51","Chromatid","Holliday_junction","Tetrahedron","Chromatid","Eukaryote","Cell_(biology)","Gene","Allele","Gamete","Chromatid","Mendelian_inheritance","CentiMorgan","Genetic_linkage","Linkage_disequilibrium","Disease","DNA_sequence","Zygote","Gene_duplication","Gene_deletion","Chromosomal_translocation","Chromosomal_inversion","Unequal_crossing_over","Coefficient_of_coincidence","Genetic_distance","Independent_assortment","Mitotic_crossover","Recombinant_frequency"]}
