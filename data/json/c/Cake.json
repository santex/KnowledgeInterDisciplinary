In its modern forms, it is\ntypically a sweet baked dessert. In its oldest forms, cakes were normally fried\nbreads or cheesecakes, and normally had a disk shape. Determining whether a\ngiven food should be classified as bread, cake, or pastry can be difficult.\n\nModern cake, especially layer cakes, normally contain a combination of flour,\nsugar, eggs, and butter or oil, with some varieties also requiring liquid\n(typically milk or water) and leavening agents (such as yeast or baking powder).\nFlavorful ingredients like fruit purÃ©es, nuts, dried or candied fruit, or\nextracts are often added, and numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients\nare possible. Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces\n(like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with\nmarzipan, piped borders or candied\nfruit.

Retrieved on 2011-12-23.\n\nCake is often the dessert of choice for meals at ceremonial occasions,\nparticularly weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake\nrecipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries\nold. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time\nconsiderable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg\nfoams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the\nmost amateur cook may bake a cake.\n","linknr":634,"url":"Cake","recorded":1362371623,"links":87,"instances":["fruit","food","geometry","plant","food","food","cake","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cakes|","World
