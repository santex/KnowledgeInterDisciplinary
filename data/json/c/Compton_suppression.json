{"cursor":"5178","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Electronic anticoincidence' is a method (and its associated hardware) widely\nused to suppress unwanted, \"background\" events in high energy physics,\nexperimental particle physics, gamma-ray spectroscopy, gamma-ray astronomy,\nexperimental nuclear physics, and related fields. In the typical case, a high-\nenergy interaction, or event, that it is desired to study occurs and is detected\nby some kind of electronic detector, creating a fast electronic pulse in the\nassociated nuclear electronics. But the desired events are mixed up with a\nsignificant number of other events, produced by other particles or other\nprocesses, which create indistinguishable events in the detector. Very often it\nis possible to arrange other physical photon or particle detectors to intercept\nthe unwanted background events, producing essentially simultaneous pulses that\ncan be used with fast electronics to reject, or veto, the unwanted background.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Compton_suppression","recorded":1362903002,"links":10,"instances":["satellite"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear physics"],"headings":["Gamma-ray astronomy","Compton suppression","Nuclear and particle physics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["uhuru","satellite"]],"members":["uhuru"],"related":["High_energy_physics","Particle_physics","Gamma-ray_spectroscopy","Gamma-ray_astronomy","Nuclear_physics","Nuclear_electronics","Gamma-ray_spectroscopy","Gamma_ray","Compton_scattering","Compton_edge","Scintillator","Large_Hadron_Collider","Nuclear_electronics","HEAO_1","HEAO_3","INTEGRAL","Uhuru_(satellite)","Gamma-ray_spectroscopy"]}
