{"cursor":"10879","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cofiring' is the combustion of two different types of materials at the same\ntime. One of the advantages of cofiring is that an existing plant can be used\nto burn a new fuel, which may be cheaper or more environmentally friendly. For\nexample, biomass is sometimes cofired in existing coal plants instead of new\nbiomass plants. Cofiring can also be used to improve the combustion of fuels\nwith low energy content. For example, landfill gas contains a large amount of\ncarbon dioxide, which is non-combustible. If the landfill gas is burned without\nremoving the carbon dioxide, the equipment may not perform properly or\nemissions of pollutants may increase. Cofiring it with natural gas increases\nthe heat content of the fuel and improves combustion and equipment performance.\nAs long as the electricity or heat produced with the biomass and landfill gas\nwas otherwise going to be produced with non-renewable fuels, the benefits are\nessentially equivalent whether they are cofired or combusted alone. Also,\ncofiring can be used to lower the emission of some pollutants. For example,\ncofiring biomass with coal results in less sulfur emissions than burning coal\nby itself.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Co-firing","recorded":1362500040,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.techtp.com/Cofiring/Biomass%20Cofiring%20in%20Coal-Fired%20Boilers.pdf","http://www.icrepq.com/pdfs/PL2.%20VALERO.pdf"],"categories":["Combustion","Incineration"],"headings":["Origin of cofiring and meaning according to present technology framework","Types of cofiring","Advantages of cofiring","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Combustion","Biomass","Coal","Landfill_gas","Carbon_dioxide","Landfill_gas","Natural_gas","Heat_content","Electricity","Heat","Biomass","Landfill_gas","Pollutants","Sulfur","Combustion","Fuels","Solid_fuels","Liquid_fuels","Fossil","Renewable","Waste","Biomass","Coal_power_station","Global_warming","Greenhouse_gas","Fossil_fuel","Renewable","Biomass","Greenhouse_gas_emissions","Biomass","Coal_power_station","Fossil_fuel","Pulverized_fuel","Fluidized_bed_combustion","Grate_firing","Cement_kilns","Waste","Biomass","Blast_furnace","Stoves","Biomass","Waste","Retrofitting","Combustion_Gas","Fouling","Combustion_Gas","Superheaters","Heat_exchangers","Selective_catalytic_reduction","Exhaust_gas","Heating_value","Gasifier","Syngas","Pyrolysis","Economy_of_scale"]}
