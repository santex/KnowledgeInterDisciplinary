{"cursor":"14341","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n.]] In genetics, a 'chromosome translocation' is a chromosome abnormality caused\nby rearrangement of parts between nonhomologous chromosomes. A gene fusion may\nbe created when the translocation joins two otherwise separated genes, the\noccurrence of which is common in cancer. It is detected on cytogenetics or a\nkaryotype of affected cells. There are two main types, 'reciprocal' (also known\nas non-Robertsonian) and 'Robertsonian'. Also, translocations can be 'balanced'\n(in an even exchange of material with no genetic information extra or missing,\nand ideally full functionality) or 'unbalanced' (where the exchange of\nchromosome material is unequal resulting in extra or missing genes).\n","linknr":524,"url":"Chromosomal_translocation","recorded":1362566707,"links":40,"instances":["human","genetics","biology","human","human"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytogenetics","Chromosomal abnormalities"],"headings":["Reciprocal (non-Robertsonian) translocations","Robertsonian translocations","Role in disease","By chromosome","History","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Rod_of_asclepius.png/15px-Rod_of_asclepius.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Translocation-4-20.png/220px-Translocation-4-20.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Chromosomal_translocations.svg/350px-Chromosomal_translocations.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["chromosome_13","human"],["chromosome_14","human"],["chromosome_21","human"],["chromosome_21","human"],["chromosome_14","human"],["locus","genetics"]],"members":["chromosome_13","locus","cell","chromosome_21","chromosome_14"],"related":["Genetics","Chromosome_abnormality","Chromosomes","Cancer","Cytogenetics","Karyotype","Cell_(biology)","Chromosome","Gene","Prenatal_diagnosis","Genetic_counseling","Genetic_testing","Meiosis","Mitosis","Chronic_Myelogenous_Leukemia","Philadelphia_Chromosome","Centromere","Karyotype","Robertsonian_translocation","Chromosome_13_(human)","Chromosome_14_(human)","Chromosome_21_(human)","Down_syndrome","Nondisjunction","Uniparental_disomy","Trisomy_rescue","Cancer","Leukemia","Acute_myelogenous_leukemia","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Ewing's_sarcoma","Infertility","Down_syndrome","Chromosome_21_(human)","Chromosome_14_(human)","Chromosome","Chromosome","Staining_dye","Locus_(genetics)","Burkitt's_lymphoma","C-myc","Fusion_protein","IGH@","Mantle_cell_lymphoma","Cyclin_D1","IGH@","Follicular_lymphoma","IGH@","Bcl-2","Papillary_thyroid_cancer","RET_proto-oncogene","Follicular_thyroid_cancer","Paired_box_gene_8","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_Î³","Acute_myeloblastic_leukemia_with_maturation","RUNX1T1","RUNX1","Cytosine_arabinoside","Philadelphia_chromosome","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia","Abl_gene","Chromosome_22","Acute_promyelocytic_leukemia","PML_protein","Retinoic_acid_receptor_alpha","ETV6","TrkC_receptor","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia","Janus_kinase_2","ETV6","Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia","RUNX1","MALT_lymphoma","BCL-2","Paracaspase","Schizophrenia","Anaplastic_large_cell_lymphoma","Ewing's_sarcoma","Dermatofibrosarcoma_protuberans","COL1A1","PDGFB","Acute_myelogenous_leukemia","Sarcoma","Oligodendroglioma","Oligoastrocytoma","Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia","Low-grade_fibromyxoid_sarcoma","FUS","CREB3L2","CREB3L1","Karl_Sax","Harvard_University","Radiation","Genetics","Accipitridae","Aneuploidy","Chromosome_abnormalities","DbCRID","Fusion_gene"]}
