{"cursor":"16617","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n:For alternative meanings of the word \"court\", see: [[Court (disambiguation)]].\n\nThe 'court' of a monarch, or at some periods an important nobleman, is a term\nfor the extended household and all those who regularly attended on the ruler or\ncentral figure. In the largest courts many thousands of individuals comprised\nthe court, many officials or servants in the permanent employ of the ruler, and\nothers attending in hope of political or financial gain, or merely for the\nsociety and entertainments offered. As well as being the centre of political\nlife, courts were usually the drivers of fashion, and often where literary,\nmusical and artistic trends first developed. Courts are found in all monarchical\nhigh cultures, although relatively little is known about Pre-Columbian court\nlife, for example. and Siamese envoys pay their respect to Louis XIV at his\ncourt in
