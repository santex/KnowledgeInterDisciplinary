{"cursor":"51706","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Conversion}} 'Conversion' is a common law tort. A conversion is a voluntary act\nby one person inconsistent with the ownership rights of another. \"[A] taking\nwith the intent of exercising over the chattel an ownership inconsistent with\nthe real owner's right of possession\" (Rolfe B), [[Fouldes v. Willoughby]]\n It is a tort of strict liability. [[Kuwait Airways Corp. v. Iraq\nAirways Co. (No. 4,5,6)]]  Its criminal counterpart is theft.\n\nExamples are seen in cases where trees are cut down and the lumber hauled from\nthe land by someone not having clear ownership; or removing furniture belonging\nto another from a cohabited dwelling, placing it in storage and not telling the\nowner of the whereabouts. In medieval times, a conversion would occur when bolts\nof cloth were bailed for safe keeping, and the bailee or a third party took them\nand made clothes for their own use or for sale. (See below)\n\nMany questions concerning joint ownership in enterprises such as a partnership\nbelong in equity, and do not rise to the level of a conversion. Traditionally, a\nconversion occurs when some chattel is lost, then found by another who\nappropriates it to his own use without legal authority to do so. It has also\napplied in cases where chattels were bailed for safe keeping, then misused or\nmisappropriated by the bailee or a third party.\n\nConversion, as a purely civil wrong, is distinguishable from both theft and\nunjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights,\nand theft will also be conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because\nconversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from\nunjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, the person who has\nanother's property may always raise a change of position defence, to say they\nhave unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there\nalways must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property,\ninconsistently with their rights.\n","linknr":851,"url":"Conversion_(law)","recorded":1362684496,"links":28,"instances":["barrister","law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tort law","Personal property law"],"headings":["Elements of conversion","History of conversion","Property subject to conversion","Acts constituting conversion","Persons entitled to bring action","Persons subject to action","Conditions precedent to recovery","Defenses","Damages","Practice and procedure in the United States","Conversion and crime","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/FamilyFarm.jpg/220px-FamilyFarm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Cattle_herd.jpg/220px-Cattle_herd.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Borel.jpg/220px-Borel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/White_Pines_Forest_State_Park_Pine_Stand4.JPG/220px-White_Pines_Forest_State_Park_Pine_Stand4.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Stern_of_the_Colombo_Express.jpg/220px-Stern_of_the_Colombo_Express.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Building_7_fire.jpg/220px-Building_7_fire.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/VegCorn.jpg/220px-VegCorn.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Charles_Duelfer.jpg/220px-Charles_Duelfer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["equity","law"],["john_williams","barrister"],["agent","law"]],"members":["john_williams","agent","equity"],"related":["Common_law","Tort","Strict_liability","Criminal","Partnership","Equity_(law)","Chattel","Theft","Unjust_enrichment","Unjust_enrichment","Change_of_position","Trover","English_law","Roman_law","Common_law","Trover","Action_on_the_case","Trespass","Detinue","Wager_of_law","Champerty_and_maintenance","Lord_Mansfield","John_Williams_(barrister)","Saunders's_Reports","United_States_law","Sex.com","Confidence_trick","Restatement_of_Torts","O'Keeffe_v._Snyder","Legal_remedy","Damages","Damages","Larceny","Agent_(law)","Trusts","Larceny_Act_1861","Larceny_Act_1901","Trover","Detinue","Rei_vindicatio","Replevin","Haslem_v._Lockwood"]}
