Crethar, H. C. & Vargas, L. A. (2007).\nMulticultural intricacies in professional counseling. In J. Gregoire & C.\nJungers (Eds.), The counselorâs companion: What every beginning counselor needs\nto know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p.61. Kristen\nSchilt and Laurel Westbrook define cisgender as a label for \"individuals who\nhave a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and\ntheir personal identity,\" complementing [[transgender]]. According to\nJulia Serano, cissexual is an adjective used in the context of gender issues to\ndescribe \"people who are not transsexual and who have only ever experienced\ntheir mental and physical sexes as being aligned,\" while cisgender is a slightly\nnarrower term for those who do not identify as transgender (a larger cultural\ncategory than the more clinical transsexual).\n\nThere are a number of derivatives of the terms in use, including cis male for a\nmale with a male gender identity, cis female for a female with a female gender\nidentity, and [[transphobia|cissexism]]. In addition, certain scholars have\nbegun to use the term cisnormativity, akin to the queer studies'\n[[heteronormativity]]. A related adjective is gender-\nnormative; Eli R. Green has written that \"'cisgendered' is used [instead of the\nmore popular 'gender normative'] to refer to people who do not identify with a gender\ndiverse experience, without enforcing existence of a 'normative' gender\nexpression.\"\n","linknr":519,"url":"Cisgender","recorded":1362889738,"links":27,"instances":["sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gender","Transgender","Words coined in the 1990s"],"headings":["Cisgender vs. cissexual","Origins","Further reading","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Portal_Transgender.svg/16px-Portal_Transgender.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Nuvola_LGBT_flag_borderless.svg/32px-Nuvola_LGBT_flag_borderless.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg/120px-Rainbow_flag_and_blue_skies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["norm","sociology"]],"members":["norm"],"related":["Gender_studies","Gender_identity","Julia_Serano","Transsexual","Transgender","Transsexual","Julia_Serano","Transsexual","Transgender","Transsexual","Norm_(sociology)","Transgender","Gender_identity","Helen_Boyd","Gender_roles","Latin","Cis-trans_isomerism","Gaul","Alps","Usenet","Transsexual","Netherlands","Sexology","Volkmar_Sigusch","Julia_Serano","Gender_taxonomy","List_of_transgender-related_topics","University_of_Texas_at_Austin"]}
