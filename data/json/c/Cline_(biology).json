For definition and an\netymology, see [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cline Merriam-Webster\nentry for \"cline\"], or http://www.greek-\nlanguage.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/search.html?lq=%CE%BA%CE%BB%CE%-\nB9%CE%BD%CF%89&dq= (in Greek). The term was coined by the English\nevolutionary biologist Julian Huxley in 1938.\n\nMore technically, clines consist of ecotypes or forms of species that exhibit\ngradual phenotypic and/or genetic differences over a geographical area,\ntypically as a result of environmental heterogeneity. Genetically, clines result\nfrom the change of allele frequencies within the gene pool of the group of taxa\nin question.
