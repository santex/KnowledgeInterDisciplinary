A recording of it\nappeared on his 1979 album [[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The\nPleasure Principle]]; it was also released as a single in the UK, where it was\na number-six hit.\n\nThe recording's backing track uses conventional acoustic drums, acoustic piano,\nand electric bass guitar, however the distinctive lead parts are performed on\nviolin, viola and heavily flanged and reverberated analogue monosynth, an\nunusual combination in popular music.\n\nLyrically, the song alludes to a psychological complex, expressing a paranoia\nthat might have been directed at critics, fans, stalkers or false friends,\ndepending on one's point of view:\n\n:Please keep them away :Don't let them touch me :Please don't let them lie\n:Don't let them see me\n\nA BBC Radio 1 review panel speculated that this song was \"the first electronic\nballad\", although this is untrue, as it post-dates recordings such as \"Hiroshima\nMon Amour\" by Ultravox and \"Neon Lights\" by Kraftwerk by a couple of years.\n\nNuman rarely performed \"Complex\" in concert throughout the '80s and '90s, with\nversions appearing on the recently re-released and expanded 1980 recordings\ncaptured on Living Ornaments '80, as well as the Micromusic video from his final\nWembley Arena concert in 1981 and its CD counterpart Living Ornaments '81. He\nrevived the song on stage in September 2003, as captured in the \"Hope Bleeds\"\nDVD and CD.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Complex_(song)","recorded":1362372538,"links":11,"instances":["music","gary_numan_album","song","psychology","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1979 singles","Gary Numan songs"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Gary_Numan-Complex.jpeg/220px-Gary_Numan-Complex.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_pleasure_principle","gary_numan_album"],["single","music"],["cars","song"],["complex","psychology"],["hiroshima_mon_amour","song"]],"members":["single","the_pleasure_principle","cars","complex","hiroshima_mon_amour"],"related":["Gary_Numan","The_Pleasure_Principle_(Gary_Numan_album)","Single_(music)","London","New_Wave_music","Synthpop","Beggars_Banquet_Records","Gary_Numan","Cars_(song)","We_Are_Glass","United_Kingdom","Gary_Numan","1979_in_music","Violin","Viola","Flanging","Monosynth","Complex_(psychology)","Ballad","Hiroshima_Mon_Amour_(song)","Ultravox","Kraftwerk","1980_in_music","Wembley_Arena","1981_in_music"]}
