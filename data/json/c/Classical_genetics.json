{"cursor":"1238","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Classical genetics' consists of the technique and methodologies of genetics\nthat predate the advent of molecular biology. A key discovery of classical\ngenetics in eukaryotes was genetic linkage. The observation that some genes do\nnot segregate independently at meiosis broke the laws of Mendelian inheritance,\nand provided science with a way to map characteristics to a location on the\nchromosomes. Linkage maps are still used today, especially in breeding for plant\nimprovement.\n\nAfter the discovery of the genetic code and such tools of cloning as\nrestriction enzymes, the avenues of investigation open to geneticists were\ngreatly broadened. Some classical genetic ideas have been supplanted with the\nmechanistic understanding brought by molecular discoveries, but many remain\nintact and in use. Classical genetics is often contrasted with reverse\ngenetics, and aspects of molecular biology are sometimes referred to as\nmolecular genetics.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Classical_genetics","recorded":1362483060,"links":26,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics|*"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clone","genetics"]],"members":["clone"],"related":["Genetics","Molecular_biology","Eukaryote","Genetic_linkage","Gene","Meiosis","Mendelian_inheritance","Chromosome","Plant_improvement","Genetic_code","Clone_(genetics)","Restriction_enzyme","Reverse_genetics","Molecular_genetics","Gregor_Mendel","Thomas_Hunt_Morgan"]}
