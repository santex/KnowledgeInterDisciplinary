      "text" : "\n\n\n'Anger' is an emotion related to one's psychological interpretation of having\nbeen offended, wronged, or denied and a tendency to react through retaliation.\nSheila Videbeck describes anger as a normal emotion that involves a strong\nuncomfortable and emotional response to a perceived provocation.<ref></ref>\nRaymond Novaco of UC Irvine, who since 1975 has published a plethora of\nliterature on the subject, stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive\n(appraisals), somatic-affective (tension and agitations), and behavioral\n(withdrawal and antagonism).<ref></ref> William DeFoore, an anger-management\nwriter, described anger as a pressure cooker: we can only apply pressure against\nour anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes.<ref></ref>\n\nAnger may have physical correlates such as increased heart rate, blood pressure,\nand levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline.<ref></ref> Some view anger as part\nof the fight or flight brain response to the perceived threat of\nharm.<ref>Harris, W., Schoenfeld, C. D., Gwynne, P. W., Weissler, A.\nM.,Circulatory and humoral responses to fear and anger, The Physiologist, 1964,\n7, 155.</ref> Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively,\nand physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to\nimmediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.<ref>Raymond\nDiGiuseppe, Raymond Chip Tafrate, Understanding Anger Disorders, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2006, pp. 133–159.</ref> The English term originally comes\nfrom the term anger of Old Norse language.<ref>Anger,The American Heritage\nDictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000, Houghton Mifflin\nCompany.</ref> Anger can have many physical and mental consequences.\n\nThe external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, body\nlanguage, physiological responses, and at times in public acts of\naggression.<ref name=\"OxfDic\">Michael Kent, Anger, The Oxford Dictionary of\nSports Science & Medicine, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-262845-3</ref>\nHumans and animals for example make loud sounds, attempt to look physically\nlarger, bare their teeth, and stare.<ref name=\"Primate\"/> The behaviors\nassociated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening\nbehavior. Rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression\nof anger by at least one of the participants.<ref name=\"Primate\">Primate\nEthology, 1967, Desmond Morris (Ed.). Weidenfeld & Nicolson Publishers: London,\np.55</ref> While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a\nresult of \"what has happened to them,\" psychologists point out that an angry\nperson can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring\ncapacity and objective observability.<ref name=\"EncPsy\">Raymond W. Novaco,\nAnger, Encyclopedia of Psychology, Oxford University Press, 2000</ref>\n\nModern psychologists view anger as a primary, natural, and mature emotion\nexperienced by virtually all humans at times, and as something that has\nfunctional value for survival. Anger can mobilize psychological resources for\ncorrective action. Uncontrolled anger can, however, negatively affect personal\nor social well-being.<ref name=\"EncPsy\"/><ref name=\"Ethics\">John W. Fiero,\nAnger, Ethics, Revised Edition, Vol 1</ref> While many philosophers and writers\nhave warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, there has\nbeen disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger.<ref name=\"AngerTheory\"/>\nThe issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the\nearliest philosophers, but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers,\nhave also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger.<ref\nname=\"AngerTheory\"/> Displays of anger can be used as a manipulation strategy\nfor social influence.<ref name=\"Sutton1\"/><ref name=\"Hochschild1\"/>\n",
