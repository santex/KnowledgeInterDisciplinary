{"cursor":"19190","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, a 'countable set' is a set with the same cardinality (number of\nelements) as some subset of the set of natural numbers. A set that is not\ncountable is called [[uncountable set|uncountable]]. The term was originated by\nGeorg Cantor. The elements of a countable set can be counted one at a\ntime—although the counting may never finish, every element of the set will\neventually be associated with a natural number.\n\nSome authors use countable set to mean a set with the same cardinality as the\nset of natural numbers. For an example of this usage see \nThe difference between the two definitions is that under the former, finite sets\nare also considered to be countable, while under the latter definition, they are\nnot considered to be countable. To resolve this ambiguity, the term 'at most\ncountable' is sometimes used for the former notion, and 'countably infinite' for\nthe latter. The term 'denumerable' can also be used to mean countably\ninfinite, See . or countable, in contrast with the term\n'nondenumerable'.
