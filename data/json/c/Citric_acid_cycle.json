{"cursor":"24577","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'citric acid cycle' â also known as the 'tricarboxylic acid cycle' ('TCA\ncycle'), the 'Krebs cycle', or the 'Szent-GyÃ¶rgyiâKrebs cycle' â is a series of chemical\nreactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the\noxidization of acetate derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon\ndioxide. In addition, the cycle provides precursors including certain amino\nacids as well as the reducing agent NADH that is used in numerous biochemical\nreactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it\nwas one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may\nhave originated abiogenically.\n\nThe name of this metabolic pathway is derived from citric acid (a type of\ntricarboxylic acid) that is first consumed and then regenerated by this sequence\nof reactions to complete the cycle. In addition, the cycle consumes acetate (in\nthe form of acetyl-CoA) and water, reduces NAD + to NADH, and produces\ncarbon dioxide. The NADH generated by the TCA cycle is fed into the oxidative\nphosphorylation pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is\nthe oxidation of nutrients to produce usable energy in the form of ATP.\n\nIn eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the\nmitochondrion. Bacteria also use the TCA cycle to generate energy, but since\nthey lack mitochondria, the reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with\nthe proton gradient for ATP production being across the plasma membrane rather\nthan the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.\n\nThe components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the\n1930s by seminal work from the Nobel laureates Albert Szent-GyÃ¶rgyi and Hans Adolf Krebs.\n","linknr":948,"url":"Citric_acid_cycle","recorded":1362502933,"links":195,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biochemistry","Cellular respiration","Exercise
