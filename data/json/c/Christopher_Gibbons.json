{"cursor":"4116","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Christopher Gibbons' (1615â1676) was an English composer and organist. He was\nthe second son, and first surviving child of the composer Orlando Gibbons.\n\nAs a child, Gibbons sang in the Chapel Royal under the direction of Nathaniel\nGiles. Gibbons most likely studied initially with his father as Orlando Gibbons\nwas the leading church musician with the courts of James I and Prince (later\nKing) Charles. After his father's early death in 1625, Gibbons moved to Exeter\nto live, for a short period, with his uncle, and father's eldest brother, Edward\nGibbons who was also a well-regarded church musician in London and Master of the\nChoristers at Exeter Cathedral.\n\nIn 1638, Gibbons, himself already a noted organist and Gentleman Chorister of\nthe Chapel Royal and Westminster Abbey, succeeded organist Thomas Holmes and\nbegan playing in the Winchester Cathedral. However, the English Civil War -\nwhich began in earnest in 1641 - lead to a suppression of Church music, and put\nan end to Gibbons' position. He fought for the Royalist cause but, after the\nexecution of Charles I and the collapse of Royalist resistance following the\nBattle of Worcester (1651), Gibbons moved to London where he lived from late in\n1651 to his death in 1676. Worthy of mention is his work with respected\ncontemporary Matthew Locke on the masque or quasi-opera Cupid and Death in 1653\n- it is one of the few works from this period that still exists in full score.\nFrom 1653 until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Gibbons made his living\nprimarily as a music teacher and, more occasionally, as a composer of incidental\nmusic for the restricted theatres of Commonwealth London.\n\nWith the return of Charles II to the English throne, Gibbons, in part because of\nhis loyalty to the crown, was immediately welcomed into the artistic fold of the\nnew court and, with church music again flourishing, was swiftly reinstated as a\nGentleman and Organist of the Chapel Royal. He subsequently became one of\nCharles' most important post-Interregnum composers, teachers and musical\nadvisors. Christopher Gibbons was one of the few Royalist musicians not to flee\nEngland for the safety of the continent (such as did Nicholas Lanier) during the\nInterregnum - and this may explain Gibbons' rapid rise in the king's favour -\nfor it had been no easy thing to remain a known Royalist in Cromwell-controlled\nLondon and had cost some their lives.\n\nGibbons was well-known and influential in the later part of his life (1660-1676)\n- he is recorded several times in the diaries of Samuel Pepys - and importantly\n(given his direct link to the musical tradition of the Elizabethan period) he\nwas responsible for the nurturing of several great Restoration composers\nincluding Blow, Humfrey and, most significantly, Henry Purcell.\n\nHis music is little known - and few examples exist of any - but it is as a\nteacher and upholder of the English musical tradition - before the almost 30-\nyear interruption to it by those socioeconomic and cultural struggles that\nculminated in the English Civil War - that secures for him a substantial role in\nthe rebirth of English music, particularly church music, during the second half\nof the 17th century.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Christopher_Gibbons","recorded":1375059348,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard?wpDestFile=Christopher_Gibbon.jpg","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Organist","/wiki/Orlando_Gibbons","/wiki/Chapel_Royal","/wiki/Nathaniel_Giles","/wiki/James_I_of_England","/wiki/Exeter","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Gibbons&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Winchester_Cathedral","/wiki/English_Civil_War","/wiki/Royalist","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/Battle_of_Worcester","/wiki/Matthew_Locke_(composer)","/wiki/Commonwealth","/wiki/Charles_II_of_England","/wiki/Interregnum","/wiki/Nicholas_Lanier","/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell","/wiki/Samuel_Pepys","/wiki/Elizabethan","/wiki/John_Blow","/wiki/Pelham_Humfrey","/wiki/Henry_Purcell","/wiki/English_Civil_War","/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&action=edit&section=1","http://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Gibbons,_Christopher","/wiki/International_Music_Score_Library_Project","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n83-206593","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/69115587","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n83206593","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&oldid=545014832","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1615_births","/wiki/Category:1676_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_composers","/wiki/Category:Baroque_composers","/wiki/Category:English_organists","/wiki/Category:Gentlemen_of_the_Chapel_Royal","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_missing_files","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Christopher+Gibbons&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Christopher+Gibbons","/wiki/Christopher_Gibbons","/wiki/Talk:Christopher_Gibbons","#","/wiki/Christopher_Gibbons","/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Christopher_Gibbons","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Christopher_Gibbons","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&oldid=545014832","/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1086692","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Christopher_Gibbons&id=545014832","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Christopher+Gibbons","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Christopher+Gibbons&oldid=545014832&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Gibbons&printable=yes","//az.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristofer_Gibbons","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Gibbons","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%92%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A1","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Gibbons","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1086692#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher
