{"cursor":"20211","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cell signalling' is part of a complex system of communication that governs\nbasic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions. The ability of cells\nto perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment is the basis of\ndevelopment, tissue repair, and immunity as well as normal tissue\nhomeostasis. Errors in cellular information processing are responsible for\ndiseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes. By understanding cell\nsignaling, diseases may be treated effectively and, theoretically, artificial\ntissues may be created.\n\nTraditional work in biology has focused on studying individual parts of cell\nsignaling pathways. Systems biology research helps us to understand the\nunderlying structure of cell signaling networks and how changes in these\nnetworks may affect the transmission and flow of information. Such networks are\ncomplex systems in their organization and may exhibit a number of emergent\nproperties including bistability and ultrasensitivity. Analysis of cell\nsignaling networks requires a combination of experimental and theoretical\napproaches including the development and analysis of simulations and modeling.\nLong-range allostery is often a significant component of cell signaling\nevents.\n","linknr":499,"url":"Cell_signaling","recorded":1362483802,"links":35,"instances":["cellular","cell_signaling","biology","biochemistry","medical","biology","biology","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell signaling|","Cell biology","Cell communication","Systems biology"],"headings":["Unicellular and multicellular organism cell signaling","Classification of intercellular communication","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/USDAbacteria.jpg/220px-USDAbacteria.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Notchccr.gif/220px-Notchccr.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Signal_transduction_pathways.png/500px-Signal_transduction_pathways.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/MAPKpathway.png/220px-MAPKpathway.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["immunity","medical"],["cell","biology"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["differentiation","cellular"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["ligand","biochemistry"],["hedgehog","cell_signaling"],["cellular_communication","biology"],["crosstalk","biology"],["hedgehog","cell_signaling"]],"members":["differentiation","hedgehog","crosstalk","receptor","immunity","cellular_communication","cell","ligand"],"related":["Complex_system","Communication","Immunity_(medical)","Homeostasis","Diseases","Cancer","Autoimmunity","Diabetes","Systems_biology","Complex_systems","Emergent_properties","Bistability","Simulations","Scientific_modelling","Allostery","Quorum_sensing","Disease","Cell_(biology)","Organisms","Mammal","Embryo","Uterus","Gastrointestinal_tract","Bacteria","Epithelium","Immune_system","Mating_of_yeast","Peptide","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Juxtacrine_signaling","Paracrine_signaling","Endocrine_system","Cellâ€“cell_interaction","Gap_junction","Cytoplasm","Cardiac_muscle","Action_potential","Cardiac_pacemaker","Notch_signaling","Juxtacrine_signalling","Differentiation_(cellular)","Gonad","Feedback_loop","Stem_cell","Hormone","Circulatory_system","Retinoic_acid","Neurotransmitter","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Adrenal_gland","Neuron","Estrogen","Ovary","Autocrine","Nitric_oxide","Redox_signaling","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Notch_signaling_pathway","Gene","Hormones","Neurotransmitters","Cytokines","Growth_factors","Ligand_(biochemistry)","Notch_signaling_pathway","Estrogen","Hydrophobic","Lipid_bilayer","Cell_membrane","Endocrine_system","Estrogen_receptor","Ovary","Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate","GABA","Ion_channel","GABA_A_receptor","Chloride","Action_potential","Physiology","Signal_transduction","Protease","Gene_regulation","Protein-protein_interaction","Cell_cycle","Cell_division","Kinase","Phosphorylation","Protein-protein_interaction","Epidermal_growth_factor","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","Adaptor_protein","MAPK","MAPK/ERK_pathway","Protein_kinase","Phosphate","Transcription_factor","C-myc","Hedgehog_(cell_signaling)","Endocrinology","Endocrine_system","Immune_cell","Neurotransmitters","Circulatory_system","Molecular_Cellular_Cognition","Cellular_communication_(biology)","Crosstalk_(biology)","MAPK/ERK_pathway","Wnt_signaling_pathway","Hedgehog_(cell_signaling)","Retinoic_acid","TGF_beta_signaling_pathway","JAK-STAT_signaling_pathway","CAMP_dependent_pathway","Protein_dynamics","Signal_transduction","Systems_biology","Lipid_signaling","Redox_signaling","Cell_Signaling_Technology","ESIGNET_Project","Netpath","Nanoscale_networking","International_q-bio_Conference_on_Cellular_Information_Processing"]}
