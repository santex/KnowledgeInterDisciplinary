{"cursor":"5777","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'membrane attack complex' ('MAC') is typically formed on the surface of\npathogenic bacterial cells as a result of the activation of the alternative\npathway and the classical pathway of the complement system, and it is one of the\neffector proteins of the immune system. The membrane-attack complex (MAC) forms\ntransmembrane channels. These channels disrupt the phospholipid bilayer of\ntarget cells, leading to cell lysis and death.\n\nA number of proteins participate in the assembly of the MAC. Freshly activated\nC5b binds to C6 to form a C5b-6 complex, then to C7 forming the C5b-7 complex.\nThe C5b-7 complex binds to C8, which is composed of three chains (alpha, beta,\nand gamma), thus forming the C5b-8 complex. C5b-8 subsequently binds to C9 and acts as a catalyst in the polymerization of C9.\nActive MAC has a subunit composition of C5b-C6-C7-C8-C9{n}.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Complement_membrane_attack_complex","recorded":1362477066,"links":16,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Complement system"],"headings":["Structure and function","Initiation: C5-C7","Polymerization: C8-C9","Inhibition","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Complement_death.PNG/220px-Complement_death.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Formowanie_MAC-en.svg/350px-Formowanie_MAC-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["homology","cell"],"related":["Pathogen","Bacteria","Cell_(biology)","Alternative_complement_pathway","Classical_complement_pathway","Complement_system","Immune_system","Protein","Plasma_membrane","MACPF","Homology_(biology)","Cytolysin","Diffusion","C5_convertase","Complement_component_5","Complement_component_6","Complement_component_7","C8_complex","Complement_component_9","Hydrophobic","Lipid_bilayer","Hydrophilic","CD59","Paroxysmal_nocturnal_haemoglobinuria"]}
