{"cursor":"2711","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Collins reagent' is the complex of chromium(VI) oxide with pyridine in\ndichloromethane. It is used to selectively oxidize primary\nalcohols to the aldehyde, and will tolerate many other functional groups within\nthe molecule.\n\n\n\nIt can be used as an alternative to the Jones reagent and pyridinium\nchlorochromate (PCC) when oxidizing secondary alcohols to ketones. Moreover, the\nCollins reagent is especially useful for oxidations of acid sensitive compounds.\n\nThis complex is both difficult and dangerous to prepare, as it is very\nhygroscopic and can inflame during preparation. It is typically used in a\nsixfold excess in order to complete the reaction. Nowadays, PCC or PDC oxidation\nhave largely supplanted Collins oxidation for these very reasons.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Collins_reagent","recorded":1362672228,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oxidizing agents","Chromium compounds"],"headings":["History","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Collins_reagent.png/300px-Collins_reagent.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chromium_trioxide","Pyridine","Dichloromethane","Alcohol_oxidation","Aldehyde","Functional_group","Jones_reagent","Pyridinium_chlorochromate","Ketone","Hygroscopic","Chromium_trioxide","Pyridine","Aldehydes","Ketones","Methylene_chloride","Aldehydes","Ketones","Jones_oxidation","Pyridinium_chlorochromate","Pyridinium_dichromate","Sarett_oxidation"]}
