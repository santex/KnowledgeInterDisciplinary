{"cursor":"21595","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Work hardening', also known as 'strain hardening' or 'cold working', is the\nstrengthening of a metal by plastic deformation. This strengthening occurs\nbecause of dislocation movements and dislocation generation within the crystal\nstructure of the material. . Most non-brittle metals with a reasonably\nhigh melting point as well as several polymers can be strengthened in this\nfashion. Alloys not amenable to heat treatment, including low-carbon steel, are\noften work-hardened. Some materials cannot be work-hardened at normal ambient\ntemperatures, such as indium, however others can only be strengthened via work\nhardening, such as pure copper and aluminum. .\n\nWork hardening may be desirable or undesirable depending on the context.\n* An example of undesirable work hardening is during machining when early passes\n  of a cutter inadvertently work-harden the workpiece surface, causing damage to\n  the cutter during the later passes. Certain alloys are more prone to this than\n  others; superalloys such as Inconel require machining strategies that take it\n  into account.\n* An example of desirable work hardening is that which occurs in metalworking\n  processes that intentionally induce plastic deformation to exact a shape\n  change. These processes are known as 'cold working' or 'cold forming'\n  processes. They are characterized by shaping the workpiece at a temperature\n  below its recrystallization temperature, usually at the ambient\n  temperature. . Cold forming techniques are usually\n  classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing.\n  Applications include the heading of bolts and cap screws and the finishing of\n  cold rolled steel.\n","linknr":295,"url":"Cold_working","recorded":1362538176,"links":27,"instances":["metallurgy","metalworking","metalworking","metalworking","metalworking","physical","device","metalworking","machining","metalworking","material","metalworking","metalworking","manufacturing","metalworking","metalworking","manufacturing","metallurgy","polymers","metallurgy","metalworking","metalworking"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Industrial
