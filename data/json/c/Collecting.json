{"cursor":"14676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nThe hobby of 'collecting' includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing,\ncataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items are of interest\nto the individual collector. Some collectors are generalists, accumulating\nmerchandise, or stamps from all countries of the world. Others focus on a\nsubtopic within their area of interest, perhaps 19th century postage stamps,\nmilk bottle labels from Sussex, or Mongolian harnesses and tack.\n\nThe items collectors collect may be antique, or simply collectible. Antiques are\ncollectible items at least 100 years old; collectibles are less than antique,\nand may even be new. Collectors and dealers may use the word vintage to describe\nolder collectibles. Most collectibles are man-made commercial items, but some\nprivate collectors collect natural objects such as birds' eggs, butterflies,\nrocks, and seashells. Items which were once everyday objects may now be\ncollectible since almost all those once produced have been destroyed or\ndiscarded are called Ephemera. Some collectors collect only in childhood while\nothers continue to do so throughout their lives and usually modify their aims\nlater in life. Philately, phillumeny, and deltiology (collecting postage stamps,\nmatchboxes and postcards) are examples of forms of collecting which can be\nundertaken at minimal expense. from the Museum Wormianum depicting Ole Worm's\ncabinet of curiosities]]\n","linknr":290,"url":"Collecting","recorded":1362559432,"links":54,"instances":["collector","writer","poster_collector","collector","instrument","dishware"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Collecting|","Forteana","Historical scientific instruments","History of biology","History of earth science","History of museums","Museum collections","Western art"],"headings":["History","Age of collected items","Types of limited editions","Secondary market","Psychological aspects","On the Internet","Notable collectors","See also","Bibliography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Stamp_album_sleeve.jpg/220px-Stamp_album_sleeve.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Musei_Wormiani_Historia.jpg/350px-Musei_Wormiani_Historia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/NutcrackerCollection.JPG/300px-NutcrackerCollection.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plate","dishware"],["bell","instrument"],["james_allen","collector"],["donald_kaufman","collector"],["hans_sachs","poster_collector"],["richard_rubin","writer"]],"members":["donald_kaufman","richard_rubin","hans_sachs","james_allen","bell","plate"],"related":["Hobby","Postage_stamp","Milk_bottle","Label","Antique","Collectible","Ephemera","Philately","Phillumeny","Deltiology","Ole_Worm","Ptolemaic_dynasty","Library_of_Alexandria","George_Thomason","Samuel_Pepys","Art_market","Furnitur","Antique","Antique_car","Antique_furniture","Collectibles","Limited_edition","Art_Deco","Art_Nouveau","Plate_(dishware)","Figurine","Bell_(instrument)","Graphics","Beer_stein","Doll","Secondary_market","Autograph_club","Forrest_J_Ackerman","James_Allen_(collector)","Raleigh_DeGeer_Amyx","Miss_Frank_E._Buttolph","John_Gardner_Coolidge","Doc_Corbin_Dart","Barry_Halper","Donald_Kaufman_(collector)","Geddy_Lee","Princess_Lida_of_Thurn_and_Taxis","Cordelia_Mendoza","Harvey_H._Nininger","Hans_Sloane","Hans_Sachs_(poster_collector)","Antiquities","Autograph_club","Book_collecting","Collectable","Hoarding","Compulsive_hoarding","List_of_popular_collectibles","Memorabilia","Saving","Singing_bird_box","Souvenir","Philipp_Blom","Charles_M._Schulz","Richard_Rubin_(writer)"]}
