{"cursor":"12447","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'councilâmanager government form' is one of two predominant forms of\nmunicipal government in the United States; the other common form of local\ngovernment is the mayor-council government form, which characteristically occurs\nin large cities. Svara, James H. (2008). Strengthening\nLocal Government Leadership and Performance: Reexamining and Updating the Winter\nCommission Goals. Public Administration Review, December 2008, Special Issue,\nvol 68, pp S37-S49. Councilâmanager government form also is used in county\ngovernments in the United States and the governing body in a county may be\ncalled a council, a commission, freeholders, aldermen, and such. The council-\nmanager form also is used for municipal government in Canada and in Ireland,\namong many other countries, both for city councils and county councils.\n\nUnder the councilâmanager form of government for municipalities, the elected\ngoverning body (commonly called a city council, city commission, or board of\nselectmen) is responsible for the legislative function of the municipality such\nas establishing policy, passing local ordinances, voting appropriations, and\ndeveloping an overall vision. [http://www.icma.org/main/topic.asp?hsid=1&tpid=20 ICMA\ninformation brochure] County and other types of local government follow\nthe same pattern, with a different title for the governing body members that\nmatches the title of the body.\n\nThe legislative body, which is voted into office by public elections, appoints a\nprofessional manager to oversee the administrative operations, implement its\npolicies, and advise it. The position of \"mayor\" present in this type of\nlegislative body is a largely ceremonial title, and may be selected by the\ncouncil from among its members or elected as an at-large council member with no\nexecutive functions. [http://icma.org/main/ld.asp?ldid=11226&hsid=10&tpid=20 ICMA\nforms of government]\n\nThe city manager position in this form of municipal government is similar to\nthat of corporate chief executive officer (CEO), providing professional\nmanagement to the board of directors. Councilâmanager government is much like a\npublicly traded corporation. [http://support.orcities.org/Portals/5/ICMA%20-\nWhy%20Local%20Government.pdf Local Government Management, ICMA] In a\ncorporation, the board of directors appoints a CEO, makes major decisions and\nwields representative power on behalf of shareholders. In councilâmanager\ngovernment, the elected council appoints a city manager, makes major decisions,\nand wields representative power on behalf of the citizens.\n\nThis system of government is used in 40.1% of American cities with populations\nof 2,500 or more, according to the 2011 Municipal Yearbook published by the\nInternational City/County Management Association (ICMA),
