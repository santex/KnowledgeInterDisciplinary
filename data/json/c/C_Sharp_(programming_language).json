It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET\ninitiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC\n23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common\nLanguage Infrastructure.\n\nC# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented\nprogramming language.
