In arguments, compromise is a concept of finding\nthrough communication, through a mutual acceptance of termsâ€”often involving\nvariations from an original goal or desire. Extremism is often considered as\nantonym to compromise, which, depending on context, may be associated with\nconcepts of balance and tolerance. In the negative connotation, compromise may\nbe referred to as capitulation, referring to a \"surrender\" of objectives,\nprinciples, or material, in the process of negotiating an agreement. In human\nrelationships \"compromise\" is frequently said to be an agreement that no party\nis happy with, this is because the parties involved often feel that they either\ngave away too much or that they received too little.<ref name=\"pmhut\"></ref>\n","title":"Compromise","headings":["Political Compromise","Studies in compromise","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Demand","1: Argument","1: Communication","1: Acceptance","1: Extremism","1: Antonym","1: Toleration","1: Connotation","1: Political_ethics","1: Game_theory","1: Voting","1: Decision_making","1: Multi-criteria_decision_analysis","1: VIKOR_method","1: Three-Fifths_Compromise","1: Connecticut_Compromise","1: Missouri_Compromise","1: Compromise_of_1850","1: Compromise_of_1867","1: Argument_to_moderation","1: Constitution","1: Win-win_game"]}
