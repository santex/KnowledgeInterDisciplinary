For\nthe [[scientific journal]]Conservation Genetics, see [[Conservation Genetics\n(journal)]].\n\n'Conservation genetics' is an interdisciplinary science that aims to apply\ngenetic methods to the conservation and restoration of biodiversity. Researchers\ninvolved in conservation genetics come from a variety of fields including\npopulation genetics, molecular ecology, biology, evolutionary biology, and\nsystematics. Genetic diversity is one of the three fundamental levels of\nbiodiversity, so it is directly important in conservation of biodiversity,\nthough genetic factors are also important in the conservation of species and\necosystem diversity. Conservation of genetic variability is important to the\noverall health of populations because decreased genetic variability leads to\nincreased levels of inbreeding, and reduced fitness.\n","linknr":278,"url":"Conservation_genetics","recorded":1362584200,"links":16,"instances":["biology","biology","genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Conservation","Applied genetics","Population genetics","Rare breed conservation"],"headings":["Genetic diversity","Importance of genetic diversity","Contributors to extinction","Techniques","Applications","Implications","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Symbol_template_class.svg/16px-Symbol_template_class.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Symbol_template_class.svg/16px-Symbol_template_class.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fitness","biology"],["locus","genetics"],["polymorphism","biology"],["microsatellite","genetics"],["microsatellite","genetics"],["hybrid","biology"],["hybrid","biology"]],"members":["fitness","polymorphism","microsatellite","hybrid","locus"],"related":["Interdisciplinary","Genetics","Biodiversity","Population_genetics","Molecular_ecology","Molecular_biology","Evolutionary_biology","Systematics","Genetic_diversity","Inbreeding","Fitness_(biology)","Genetic_diversity","Alleles","Locus_(genetics)","Polymorphism_(biology)","Genetic_diversity","Inbreeding","Mutations","Heterozygosity","Outbreeding_depression","Habitat_fragmentation","Taxonomic","Genetic_drift","Natural_selection","Allozymes","Alloenzymes","RFLP","Amplified_fragment_length_polymorphism","RAPD","Single_strand_conformation_polymorphism","Minisatellite","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Single-nucleotide_polymorphisms","DNA_sequencing","DNA_fingerprinting","Mitochondrial_DNA","Chloroplast_genome","Major_Histocompatibility_Complex","Microsatellite_(genetics)","Minisatellite","Heterozygosity","Cryopreservation","Effective_population_size","Hybrid_(biology)","Minisatellite","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Phylogenetics","Phylogenetic_diversity","Hybrid_(biology)","Evolutionary_Significant_Unit","Endangered","Inbreeding_depression","Outbreeding_depression","Fisher's_fundamental_theorem_of_natural_selection","Forensic","Genetically_modified_organisms","Adaptation","Industrial_melanism","Noninvasive_genotyping"]}
