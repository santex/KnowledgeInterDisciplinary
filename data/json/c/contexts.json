of the American\nSociological Association. It is designed to be a more accessible source of\nsociological ideas and research and has been inspired by the movement towards\npublic sociology. The journal was established in 2002 by Claude Fischer and is\npublished by SAGE Publications; until 2011, it was published by the University\nof California Press. Fischer was succeeded by Jeff Goodwin and James M. Jasper,\nwho edited the journal from 2005 to 2007, injecting a certain amount of\ncontroversial humor such as New Yorker cartoons and a column written by \"Harry\nGreen\" (actually Jasper) called \"The Fool.\" The current editors-in-chief are\nJodi O'Brien and Arlene Stein.\n\nThe journal differs from a typical academic journal as it is targeted more\ntoward students and the general public. It is used widely in courses, and has\nbeen excerpted in The Contexts Reader edited by Jeff Goodwin and James M.\nJasper. The Reader is also used in many undergraduate courses.\n","title":"contexts","headings":["Abstracting and indexing","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Sociology","2: SAGE_Publications","1: Peer_review","1: Academic_journal","1: American_Sociological_Association","1: Public_sociology","1: Claude_Fischer","1: University_of_California_Press","1: Jeff_Goodwin","1: James_M._Jasper","1: Editors-in-chief","1: SocINDEX","1: Sociological_Abstracts"]}
