Earl Babbie defines it as \"the study\nof recorded human communications, such as books, websites, paintings and laws.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Farooq Joubish, content analysis is considered a scholarly\nmethodology in the humanities by which texts are studied as to authorship,\nauthenticity, or meaning. This latter subject includes philology, hermeneutics,\nand semiotics.\n\nHarold Lasswell formulated the core questions of content analysis: \"Who says\nwhat, to whom, why, to what extent and with what effect?.\" Ole Holsti (1969)\noffers a broad definition of content analysis as \"any technique for making\ninferences by objectively and systematically identifying specified\ncharacteristics of f messages.\" Kimberly A. Neuendorf (2002, p.Â 10) offers\na six-part definition of content analysis:\n\n\"Content analysis is a summarising, quantitative analysis of messages that\nrelies on the scientific method (including attention to objectivity,\nintersubjectivity, a priori design, reliability, validity, generalisability,\nreplicability, and hypothesis testing) and is not limited as to the types of\nvariables that may be measured or the context in which the messages are created\nor presented.\"\n","linknr":371,"url":"Content_analysis","recorded":1362535054,"links":45,"instances":["literary_theory","sociology","existential","semiotics"],"pdf":["http://www.andersonanalytics.com/reports/AATAT.pdf"],"categories":["Social sciences methodology","Evaluation methods","Methods in sociology"],"headings":["Description","Uses of content analysis","The process of a content analysis","Reliability in content analysis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["text","literary_theory"],["meaning","existential"],["articulation","sociology"],["sign","semiotics"]],"members":["text","articulation","meaning","sign"],"related":["Methodology","Social_sciences","Communication","Earl_Babbie","Book","Website","Painting","Law","Scholarly","Humanities","Text_(literary_theory)","Authorship","Authentication","Meaning_(existential)","Philology","Hermeneutics","Semiotics","Harold_Lasswell","Ole_Holsti","Kimberly_A._Neuendorf","Alfred_R._Lindesmith","Key_Word_in_Context","Categorised_analysis","David_Robertson","Coding_frame","Party_competition","List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom","List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States","Comparative_approach","Content-analytic_approach","Policy","Public_relations","Media_relations","Media_profiles","Media_evaluation","Newspaper_circulation","Readership","Futurist","John_Naisbitt","Articulation_(sociology)","Logic_of_the_contingent","Post-structuralism","The_Real","Brazil","Discursive_articulations","Lipset","Rokkan","Lijphart","Sign_(semiotics)","Anthony_Downs","Value_theory","Knowledge","Evaluation","Ole_Holsti","Categorisation","Inference","Communication","Causality","Paradigm","Authorship_analysis","Klaus_Krippendorff","Newspaper","Radio","Television","Key_Word_in_Context","Robert_Philip_Weber","Krippendorff","Dermot_McKeone","Neuendorf,_Kimberly_A.","Hermeneutics","Donald_Wayne_Foster","Transition_words","Earl_Babbie","Bernard_Berelson","Ian_Budge","Hans-Dieter_Klingemann","Ole_R._Holsti","Krippendorff,_Klaus","Krippendorff,_Klaus","Dermot_McKeone","Neuendorf,_Kimberly_A.","Neuendorf,_Kimberly_A.","Roberts,_Carl_W.","Weber,_Robert_Philip","Wimmer,_Roger_D.","Joseph_R._Dominick"]}
