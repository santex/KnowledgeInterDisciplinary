Lyrically, it is an autobiographical account, written by Peart,\nabout the time he spent living in England, and his eventual disillusionment with\nhis then-current occupations.\n\nMusically, it's a hard-hitting rock song, complete with power-chords and riffs,\nsimilar to much of their early 70s albums. It also features a keyboard break,\nnear the middle of the song, similar to the one in \"The Trees,\" supplied by\nGeddy Lee's Oberheim 8-voice Polyphonic Synthesizer, backed by Taurus pedals,\nNeil Peart's orchestral bells and a simple, soft chord progression by Alex\nLifeson, before breaking back into the song's hard rock feel. It was only played\na handful of times in concert, on the Tour of the Hemispheres from late 1978 to\nearly 1979, before the 2007 Snakes & Arrows Tour when it was played every night\nin the first set of the band's 3 hour live show.\n","linknr":259,"url":"Circumstances_(song)","recorded":1362574321,"links":20,"instances":["record_producer","band","rush_song","rush_album"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1978 singles","Rush (band) songs","Multilingual songs","Songs produced by Terry Brown","Songs written by Neil Peart","Songs written by Geddy Lee","Songs written by Alex Lifeson"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Nuvola_apps_kscd.png/30px-Nuvola_apps_kscd.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rush","band"],["hemispheres","rush_album"],["terry_brown","record_producer"],["the_trees","rush_song"],["hemispheres","rush_album"],["the_trees","rush_song"],["rush","band"],["the_trees","rush_song"]],"members":["terry_brown","rush","the_trees","hemispheres"],"related":["Rush_(band)","Hemispheres_(Rush_album)","Hard_rock","Progressive_rock","Neil_Peart","Geddy_Lee","Alex_Lifeson","Terry_Brown_(record_producer)","The_Trees_(Rush_song)","The_Spirit_of_Radio","Hemispheres_(Rush_album)","The_Trees_(Rush_song)","Progressive_rock","Rush_(band)","Neil_Peart","England","Rush_discography","The_Trees_(Rush_song)","Alex_Lifeson","Hard_rock","Hemispheres_Tour","Snakes_&_Arrows_Tour","List_of_Rush_songs"]}
