Rossman'\n(June 17, 1881 â January 16, 1928) was an American first baseman in Major League\nBaseball. He played five seasons in the American League with the Cleveland Naps\n(1904; 1906), Detroit Tigers (1907â1909) and St. Louis Browns (1909). Born in\nPhilmont, New York, he batted and threw left-handed.\n\nRossman began playing professional baseball in 1903 in the Connecticut League\nand was with Holyoke in 1903 and 1904. He was drafted by the Cleveland Naps but\nwas sent to the Naps' minor league team in Des Moines in 1905. Rossman finally\nmade it to the major leagues in September 1904, playing 16 games in right field\nfor the Naps in the closing weeks of the season.\n\nRossman did not play in the majors in 1905 but won a spot as the Naps' starting\nfirst baseman in 1906. He hit .308 in 118 games with 53 RBIs. Rossman's .308\naverage in was 8th best in the American League and third highest among the\nCleveland regularsâtrailing two Hall of Famers, Nap Lajoie and Elmer Flick.\n\nIn December 1906, the Naps sold Rossman to the Detroit Tigers. With Ty Cobb and\nSam Crawford already in the Detroit lineup, the addition of manager Hughie\nJennings and Rossman in 1907 gave the Tigers the spark they needed to win three\nstraight American League pennants from 1907 to 1909.\n\nRossman had a good season for the Tigers in 1907, playing 153 games at first\nbase. He was among the 1907 American League leaders in RBIs (69), hits (158),\ntotal bases (195) and runs created (62). Rossman also excelled in the 1907 World\nSeries, batting .474 with a .579 slugging percentage, 9 hits, 2 RBIs and a run.\nUnfortunately for the Tigers, their two biggest hitting stars, Ty Cobb and Sam\nCrawford, did not come through, hitting .200 and .238 respectively. Rossman had\nas many hits and triples in the 1907 World Series as Cobb and Crawford combined.\n\nIn , Rossman had the best year of his career. Rossman was among the American\nLeague leaders in most batting categories: 2nd in dobules with 33 (trailing only\nTy Cobb); 3rd in total bases with 219 and extra base hits with 48 (trailing\nteammates Cobb and Crawford in both categories); 4th in slugging percentage at\n.418; 5th in RBIs (71), triples (13), and OPS (.748); and 6th in batting average\nat .294. In the 1908 World Series), Rossman had two hits and 3 RBIs in another\nlosing effort to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nBatting behind Ty Cobb in the Detroit lineup, Rossman had a useful talent for\nlaying down bunts. Rossman was so proficient at bunting that Cobb was regularly\nable to streak from first to third base on Rossman's bunts.\n\nRossman was also involved in an infamous incident involving Ty Cobb. With the\nTigers and Athletics in a pennant race in 1907, the Tigers and As played in a\n14-inning game with the score tied 8â8. When Sam Crawford misplayed a fly ball\nin the 14th inning, the Tigers claimed that a Philadelphia policeman had\ninterfered with Crawford. Cobb tried to provoke things further by telling\nRossman that Monte Cross of the A's had called Rossman \"a Jew bastard.\" Rossman\npunched Cross and was both ejected from the game and arrested by the\nPhiladelphia police. As the situation escalated into a near-riot, plate umpire\nSilk Loughlin ruled that Crawford had been interfered with. Cobb later called\nthis game his \"most thrilling,\" and his anti-Semitic baiting of Rossman played a\nkey role in the incident. (Al Stump, Cobb: The Life and Times of the Meanest Man\nWho Ever Played Baseball (1994), p. 154.\n\nOn August 20, , with Rossman batting .261 in his third season in Detroit, the\nTigers traded him to the St. Louis Browns for Tom Jones. Rossman played in\nonly 2 games for the Browns, his last major league game occurring on\nSeptember 3, 1909.\n\nRossman continued to play professionally in the American Association after\nleaving the Browns. First with Columbus in 1910 and later that season with\nMinneapolis, where he continued to play until 1914.\n\nRossman had a peculiar emotional quirk where he sometimes froze and could not\nthrow the ball when he became excited. Runners would lead off first to draw a\nthrow from the pitcher, then run to second when Rossman froze. [http://www.-\nbaseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Claude_Rossman_1881 The\nBallplayers - Claude Rossman | BaseballLibrary.com ]\nat www.baseballlibrary.com Rossman had excellent range as a first baseman.\nHis career Range factor of 11.06 at first base was almost 2.00 full points above\nthe average for first baseman of his era. But his propensity to freeze with the\nball in his throwing hand is said to have greatly shortened his career. He was\n28 when he played his last major league game.\n\nIn 511 major league games, Rossman hit .283 with 523 hits, 238 RBI, 175 runs,\n109 extra base hits, and 49 stolen bases.\n\nRossman died at age 46 in Poughkeepsie, New York, while residing as a patient at\nthe Hudson River State Hospital for the Insane where he had been a patient for\nseveral years. He was buried at an unknown cemetery in Philmont, New York.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Claude_Rossman","recorded":1374859477,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Claude_Rossman_baseball_card.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Claude_Rossman_baseball_card.jpg/200px-Claude_Rossman_baseball_card.jpg","/wiki/First_Baseman","/wiki/Philmont,_New_York","/wiki/Poughkeepsie,_New_York","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/Major_League_Baseball","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Cleveland_Indians","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Philmont,_New_York","/wiki/Cleveland_Naps","/wiki/First_baseman","/wiki/1906_in_baseball","/wiki/American_League","/wiki/Nap_Lajoie","/wiki/Elmer_Flick","/wiki/Detroit_Tigers","/wiki/Ty_Cobb","/wiki/Sam_Crawford","/wiki/Hughie_Jennings","/wiki/File:ClaudeRossman.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6f/ClaudeRossman.jpg/250px-ClaudeRossman.jpg","/wiki/File:ClaudeRossman.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/1907_World_Series","/wiki/Ty_Cobb","/wiki/Sam_Crawford","/wiki/1908_in_baseball","/wiki/Ty_Cobb","/wiki/Extra_base_hit","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/1908_World_Series","/wiki/Chicago_Cubs","/wiki/Ty_Cobb","/wiki/Ty_Cobb","/wiki/Monte_Cross","/w/index.php?title=Silk_Loughlin&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/1909_in_baseball","/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles","/wiki/Tom_Jones_(baseball_player)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Range_factor","/wiki/Runs_batted_in","/wiki/Extra_base_hits","/wiki/Poughkeepsie_(city),_New_York","/w/index.php?title=Hudson_River_State_Hospital_for_the_Insane&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Philmont,_New_York","/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Claude_Rossman_1881","/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&action=edit&section=2","http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rossmcl01.shtml","http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=rossma001cla","http://www.thedeadballera.com/Obits/Rossman.Claude.Obit.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Philmont,_New_York","/wiki/Poughkeepsie,_New_York","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&oldid=485454240","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1881_births","/wiki/Category:1928_deaths","/wiki/Category:Major_League_Baseball_first_basemen","/wiki/Category:Baseball_players_from_New_York","/wiki/Category:Cleveland_Naps_players","/wiki/Category:Detroit_Tigers_players","/wiki/Category:St._Louis_Browns_players","/wiki/Category:Holyoke_Paperweights_players","/wiki/Category:Des_Moines_Underwriters_players","/wiki/Category:Columbus_Senators_players","/wiki/Category:Minneapolis_Millers_(baseball)_players","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Claude+Rossman&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Claude+Rossman","/wiki/Claude_Rossman","/wiki/Talk:Claude_Rossman","#","/wiki/Claude_Rossman","/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Claude_Rossman","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Claude_Rossman","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&oldid=485454240","/w/index.php?title=Claude_Rossman&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5
