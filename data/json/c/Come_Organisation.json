{"cursor":"1557","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Come Organisation' was a record label started by William Bennett in 1979 as a\nway to release albums by his own band, Come, when he was unable to find a label\nwilling to release them. It is best known for releasing the work of Bennett's\nsubsequent band, Whitehouse.\n\nThe label's first release was the Come single \"Come Sunday / Shaved Slits\" in\n1980. When Bennett dissolved Come in 1980 to form Whitehouse, Come\nOrganisation continued to release his work, serving as the label for all of\nWhitehouse's albums from its inception through 1985's [[Great White Death]].\nIn addition, Bennett began to release albums by other controversial or extreme\ngroups, including Sutcliffe Jugend, Maurizio Bianchi, Nurse With Wound and\neven Charles Manson.\n\nWhen Whitehouse went on hiatus at the end of 1985, Come Organisation was\ndissolved. Bennett again created a label for his releases in 1988, but called it\nSusan Lawly rather than reviving Come Organisation.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Come_Organisation","recorded":1362581919,"links":15,"instances":["band","noise_musician","uk_band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["British record labels","Record labels established in 1979","Record labels disestablished in 1985","Noise music record labels"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/ComeOrgPricelist.jpg/220px-ComeOrgPricelist.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["william_bennett","noise_musician"],["come","uk_band"],["whitehouse","band"]],"members":["whitehouse","william_bennett","come"],"related":["Record_label","William_Bennett_(noise_musician)","1979_in_music","Come_(UK_band)","Whitehouse_(band)","Sutcliffe_Jugend","Maurizio_Bianchi","Nurse_With_Wound","Charles_Manson","1985_in_music","Susan_Lawly","List_of_record_labels"]}
