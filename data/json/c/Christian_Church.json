For particular\ncommunities with similar names, see [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]\nor [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]].\n\n\nThe term 'Christian Church' as a proper noun refers to the whole Christian\nreligious tradition through history. When used in this way, the term does not\nrefer to a particular \"Christian church\" (a \"denomination\" or to a building).\nHowever, some Christian groups do not accept this definition (e.g., the Roman\nCatholic Church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, and the Eastern Orthodox\nchurches) instead considering only their own churches to be the one true church.\n\nThis article addresses the Christian Church broadly, taking account of the\nvariety of conceptions about it, some identifying it with a concrete visible\nstructure (the view of Oriental Orthodoxy, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the\nRoman Catholic), others seeing it as an invisible reality not identified with\nany earthly structure (the general Protestant view), and others equating it with\na particular set of groups that share certain essential elements of doctrine and\npractice, though divided on other points of doctrine and practice and in\ngovernment (the branch theory as taught by some Anglicans).\n\nThe Greek term á¼ÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏÎ¯Î±, which is transliterated as \"ecclesia\", generally meant\nan \"assembly\", [http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-\nbin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.14:1:160.lsj Liddell and Scott:á¼ÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏÎ¯Î±] but\nin most English translations of the New Testament is usually translated as\n\"church\". This term appears in two verses of the Gospel of Matthew, twenty-four\nverses of the Acts of the Apostles, fifty-eight verses of the Pauline Epistles\n(including the earliest instances of its use in relation to a Christian body),\ntwo verses of the Letter to the Hebrews, one verse of the Epistle of James,\nthree verses of the Third Epistle of John, and nineteen verses of the Book of\nRevelation. In total, á¼ÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏÎ¯Î± appears in the New Testament text 114 times,\nalthough not every instance is a technical reference to the church. http://-\nwww.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1950s/vol_2_no_4_contents/-\nward.html\n\nIn the New Testament, the term á¼ÎºÎºÎ»Î·ÏÎ¯Î± (\"church\" or \"assembly\") is used for\nlocal communities as well as in a universal sense to mean all\nbelievers. McKim, Donald K., Westminster Dictionary of Theological Terms,\nWestminster John Knox Press, 1996 Traditionally, only orthodox\nbelievers are considered part of the true church, but convictions of what is\northodox vary.\n\nThe four traditional \"notes of the Christian Church\" or descriptors of the\nchurch, first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity,\nand apostolicity.
