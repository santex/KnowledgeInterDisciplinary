Behind them smoke or fog obscures the\n rest of the terrain]] An 'officer' is a member of an armed force or uniformed\n service who holds a position of authority. Commissioned officers derive\n authority directly from a sovereign power and, as such, hold a commission\n charging them with the duties and responsibilities of a specific office or\n position. Commissioned officers are typically the only persons, in an armed\n forces environment, able to act as the commanding officer (according to the\n most technical definition of the word) of a military unit.<ref></ref> A\n superior officer is an officer with a higher rank than another officer, who is\n a subordinate officer relative to the superior.\n\nNon-commissioned officers (NCOs) in positions of authority can be said to have\ncontrol or charge rather than command per se; the use of the word \"command\" to\ndescribe any use of authority is often unofficial.\n\nHaving officers is one requirement for combatant status under the laws of war,\nthough these officers need not have obtained an official commission or warrant.\nIn such case, those persons holding offices of responsibility within the\norganization are deemed to be the officers, and the presence of these officers\nconnotes a level of organization sufficient to designate a group as being\ncombatant.\n",
