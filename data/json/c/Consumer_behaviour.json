Kuester, Sabine (2012): MKT 301:\nStrategic Marketing & Marketing in Specific Industry Contexts, University of\nMannheim, p. 110. It blends elements from psychology, sociology, social\nanthropology and economics. It attempts to understand the decision-making\nprocesses of buyers, both individually and in groups. It studies\ncharacteristics of individual consumers such as demographics and behavioural\nvariables in an attempt to understand people's wants. It also tries to assess\ninfluences on the consumer from groups such as family, friends, reference\ngroups, and society in general.\n\nCustomer behaviour study is based on consumer buying behaviour, with the\ncustomer playing the three distinct roles of user, payer and buyer. Research has\nshown that consumer behaviour is difficult to predict, even for experts in the\nfield. Relationship marketing is an influential asset for customer\nbehaviour analysis as it has a keen interest in the re-discovery of the true\nmeaning of marketing through the re-affirmation of the importance of the\ncustomer or buyer. A greater importance is also placed on consumer retention,\ncustomer relationship management, personalisation, customisation and one-to-one\nmarketing. Social functions can be categorized into social choice and welfare\nfunctions.\n\nEach method for vote counting is assumed as social function but if Arrowâs\npossibility theorem is used for a social function, social welfare function is\nachieved. Some specifications of the social functions are decisiveness,\nneutrality, anonymity, monotonicity, unanimity, homogeneity and weak and strong\nPareto optimality. No social choice function meets these requirements in an\nordinal scale simultaneously. The most important characteristic of a social\nfunction is identification of the interactive effect of alternatives and\ncreating a logical relation with the ranks. Marketing provides services in order\nto satisfy customers. With that in mind, the productive system is considered\nfrom its beginning at the production level, to the end of the cycle, the\nconsumer (Kioumarsi et al., 2009).\n","linknr":263,"url":"Consumer_behaviour","recorded":1362483687,"links":58,"instances":["psychologist","psychology"],"pdf":["http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Prediction%20of%20consumer%20behavior.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Prediction%20of%20consumer%20behavior.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/brief.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/brief.pdf"],"categories":["Consumer behaviour|","Marketing analytics"],"headings":["Black box model","Information search","Evaluation of alternatives","Purchase decision","Postpurchase evaluation","Other influences","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stimulus","psychology"],["barry_schwartz","psychologist"]],"members":["barry_schwartz","stimulus"],"related":["Psychology","Sociology","Social_Anthropology","Anthropology","Economics","Demographic","Consumer","Relationship_marketing","Social_choice","Arrow's_impossibility_theorem","Neutrality","Anonymity","Monotonicity","Unanimity","Pareto_optimality","Stimulus_(psychology)","Black_box_theory","Behaviorism","Marketing","Demographics","Psychographics","Personality","Motivation","Culture","Sub-culture","Ethnicity","Social_class","Food_and_Brand_Lab","Consumer_socialization","Art_&_Copy","Window_shopping","Consumer_confusion","Angus_Deaton","Cengage_Learning","Vance_Packard","Barry_Schwartz_(psychologist)","Ellen_Ruppel_Shell"]}
