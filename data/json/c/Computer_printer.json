Wide carriage\n printers were often used by businesses, to print accounting records on 11\" x\n 14\" tractor-feed paper. They were also called \"132-column printers\"]] while\n printing a page.]]\n\nIn computing, a 'printer' is a peripheral which produces a representation of an\nelectronic document on physical media such as paper or transparency film. Many\nprinters are local peripherals connected directly to a nearby personal computer.\nIndividual printers are often designed to support both local and network\nconnected users at the same time. Some printers can print documents stored on\nmemory cards or from digital cameras and scanners. Multifunction printers (MFPs)\ninclude a scanner and can copy paper documents or send a fax; these are also\ncalled multi-function devices (MFD), or all-in-one (AIO) printers. Most MFPs\ninclude printing, scanning, and copying among their many features.\n\nConsumer and some commercial printers are designed for low-volume, short-\nturnaround print jobs; requiring virtually no setup time to achieve a hard copy\nof a given document. However, printers are generally slow devices (30 pages per\nminute is considered fast, and many inexpensive consumer printers are far slower\nthan that), and the cost per page is actually relatively high. However, this is\noffset by the on-demand convenience and project management costs being more\ncontrollable compared to an out-sourced solution. The printing press remains the\nmachine of choice for high-volume, professional publishing. However, as printers\nhave improved in quality and performance, many jobs which used to be done by\nprofessional print shops are now done by users on local printers; see desktop\npublishing. Local printers are also increasingly taking over the process of\nphotofinishing as digital photo printers become commonplace.\n\nThe world's first computer printer was a 19th century mechanically driven\napparatus invented by Charles Babbage for his difference engine.\n\nA virtual printer is a piece of computer software whose user interface and API\nresembles that of a printer driver, but which is not connected with a physical\ncomputer printer.\n","linknr":502,"url":"Computer_printer","recorded":1362675475,"links":103,"instances":["projection","publishing","computing","paper_size","command","mathematics","typography"],"pdf":["http://www.abagnale.com/pdf/protection_b.pdf","http://www.abagnale.com/pdf/protection_b.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/416/zable.pdf","http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/416/zable.pdf"],"categories":["Computer
