H. pylori strains can be divided into CagA positive\nor negative strains, of which around 60% of H. pylori isolates in Western\ncountries are positive, whereas the majority of East Asian isolates are\nnegative.\n\nThe cag PAI also encodes for a type 4 secretion system which is used to \"inject\"\nCagA into a target cell upon H. pylori attachment. After translocation, CagA\nlocalises to the inner surface of the cell membrane and undergoes tyrosine\nphosphorylation by Src family kinases (e.g. Fyn and Lyn).\n","linknr":99,"url":"CagA","recorded":1362486604,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Virulence factors"],"headings":["Role in Cancer","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pathogenicity_island","Secretion","Src_family_kinase","FYN","LYN","MALT_lymphoma","Gastric_adenocarcinoma","PTPN11","Hepatocyte_growth_factor","Metastasis"]}
