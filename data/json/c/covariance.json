If the greater values of one variable mainly\ncorrespond with the greater values of the other variable, and the same holds for\nthe smaller values, i.e., the variables tend to show similar behavior, the\ncovariance is positive.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Covariance.html</ref>\nIn the opposite case, when the greater values of one variable mainly correspond\nto the smaller values of the other, i.e., the variables tend to show opposite\nbehavior, the covariance is negative. The sign of the covariance therefore shows\nthe tendency in the linear relationship between the variables. The magnitude of\nthe covariance is not easy to interpret. The normalized version of the\ncovariance, the correlation coefficient, however, shows by its magnitude the\nstrength of the linear relation.\n\nA distinction must be made between (1) the covariance of two random variables,\nwhich is a population parameter that can be seen as a property of the joint\nprobability distribution, and (2) the sample covariance, which serves as an\nestimated value of the parameter.\n","title":"covariance","headings":["Definition","Properties","Calculating the sample covariance","Comments","Applications","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Random_vector","3: Covariance_matrix","2: Random_variable","2: Expected_value","2: Transpose","1: Probability_theory","1: Statistics","1: Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient","1: Statistical_population","1: Statistical_parameter","1: Joint_probability_distribution","1: Statistical_estimation","1: Joint_distribution","1: Real_number","1: Second_moment","1: Loss_of_significance","1: Donald_E._Knuth","1: Cross_covariance","1: Uncorrelated","1: Unit_of_measurement","1: Correlation","1: Dimensionless_number","1: Variance","1: Linear_transformation","1: Whitening_transformation","1: Statistical_independence","1: Inner_product","1: Bilinear_operator","1: Definite_bilinear_form","1: Lp_space","1: Cauchyâ€“Schwarz_inequality","1: Bias_of_an_estimator","1: Mean","1: Linear_algebra","1: Linear_dependence","1: Correlation_matrix","1: Pearson_coefficient","1: Financial_economics","1: Modern_portfolio_theory","1: Capital_asset_pricing_model","1: Normative_economics","1: Positive_economics","1: Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Covariance","1: Analysis_of_covariance","1: Autocovariance","1: Correlation_and_dependence","1: Covariance_function","1: Covariance_operator","1: Distance_covariance","1: Eddy_covariance","1: Law_of_total_covariance","1: Propagation_of_uncertainty"]}
