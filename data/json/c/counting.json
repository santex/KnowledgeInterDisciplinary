The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a\n(mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some\norder, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same\nelement more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was\nset to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object\ngives the desired number of elements. The related term [[enumeration]] refers to\nuniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite\nset by assigning a number to each element.\n\n at Hanakapiai Beach]] Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for\n example, when counting money, counting out change, \"counting by twos\" (2, 4, 6,\n 8, 10, 12, ...), or \"counting by fives\" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).\n\nThere is archeological evidence suggesting that humans have been counting for at\nleast 50,000 years.<ref>An Introduction to the History of Mathematics (6th\nEdition) by Howard Eves (1990) p.9</ref> Counting was primarily used by ancient\ncultures to keep track of social and economic data such as number of group\nmembers, prey animals, property, or debts (i.e., accountancy). The development\nof counting led to the development of mathematical notation, numeral systems,\nand writing.\n","title":"counting","headings":["Forms of counting","Inclusive counting","Education and development","Counting in mathematics","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Finite_set","2: Finger_counting","2: Combinatorics","1: Hanakapiai_Beach","1: Howard_Eves","1: Accountancy","1: Mathematical_notation","1: Numeral_system","1: Writing","1: Tally_marks","1: Base_2","1: Finger_binary","1: Quinquagesima","1: Jesus","1: Death_and_resurrection_of_Jesus","1: Brian_Butterworth","1: Subitize","1: Williams_syndrome","1: One_to_one_correspondence","1: Mathematical_induction","1: Function_composition","1: Natural_number","1: Infinite_set","1: Countably_infinite","1: Integer","1: Real_number","1: Uncountable_set","1: Cardinality","1: Set_theory","1: Injective","1: Surjective","1: Pigeonhole_principle","1: Computable_number","1: Enumerative_combinatorics","1: Permutation","1: Kirby_Lester_Pharmacy_Automation","1: Cardinal_number","1: Developmental_psychology","1: Elementary_arithmetic","1: History_of_mathematics","1: Jeton","1: Level_of_measurement","1: Ordinal_number","1: Subitizing_and_counting","1: Tally_mark","1: Unary_numeral_system","1: List_of_numbers","1: List_of_numbers_in_various_languages"]}
