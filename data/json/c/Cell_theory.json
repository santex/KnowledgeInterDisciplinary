{"cursor":"8233","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\nIn biology, 'cell theory' is a scientific theory that describes the properties\nof cells, the basic unit of structure in every living thing. The initial\ndevelopment of the theory, during the mid-17th century, was made possible by\nadvances in microscopy; the study of cells is called cell biology. Cell theory\nis one of the foundations of biology.\n\nThe three parts to the cell theory are as described below:\n# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells. The cell is the basic\n# unit of structure, function, and organization in all organisms. All cells come\n# from preexisting, living cells.\n","linknr":238,"url":"Cell_theory","recorded":1362501958,"links":58,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell biology","Scientific terminology","History of biology","Biology theories"],"headings":["History","Modern interpretation","Types of cells","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg/300px-Average_prokaryote_cell-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Cork_Micrographia_Hooke.png/300px-Cork_Micrographia_Hooke.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["cell","biology"],["domain","biology"]],"members":["domain","cell"],"related":["Biology","Scientific_theory","Cell_(biology)","Microscopy","Cell_biology","Robert_Hooke","Robert_Hooke","Cell_nucleus","Organelle","Sacharias_Jansen","Anton_van_Leeuwenhoek","Algae","Bacteria","Vitalism","Ludolph_Christian_Treviranus","Johann_Jacob_Paul_Moldenhawer","Henri_Dutrochet","Theodor_Schwann","Matthias_Jakob_Schleiden","Rudolf_Virchow","Robert_Remak","Cell_(biology)","Metabolism","Biochemistry","Cell_nucleus","DNA","Organelle","Ribosome","Bacteria","Archaea","Domain_(biology)","Mitochondria","Chloroplasts","Lysosomes","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Vacuoles","Germ_theory_of_disease","Cell_biology","Cell_adhesion","Cellular_differentiation"]}
