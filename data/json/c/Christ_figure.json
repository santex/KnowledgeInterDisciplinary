{"cursor":"16747","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'Christ figure', also known as a 'Christ-Image' is a literary technique that\nthe author uses to draw allusions between their characters and the biblical\nJesus Christ. More loosely, the Christ Figure is a spiritual or prophetic\ncharacter who parallels Jesus, or other spiritual or prophetic figures.\n\nIn general, a character should display more than one correspondence with the\nstory of Jesus Christ as depicted in the Bible. For instance, the character\nmight display one or more of the following traits: performance of miracles,\nmanifestation of divine qualities, healing others, display loving kindness and\nforgiveness, fight for justice, being guided by the spirit of the character's\nfather, death and resurrection. Christ figures are often martyrs, sacrificing\nthemselves for causes larger than themselves.\n\nIn postmodern literature, the resurrection theme is often abandoned, leaving us\nwith the image of a martyr sacrificing himself for a greater good. It is common\nto see Christ figures displayed in a manner suggestive of crucifixion as well.\n","linknr":517,"url":"Christ_figure","recorded":1362371286,"links":15,"instances":["character","the_matrix","character","the_lion_king","novel","the_day_the_earth_stood_still","doctor_who","film_series","deity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heroes by role","Jesus in popular culture"],"headings":["Literature","Stage, Television and film","Comics and animation","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["harry_potter","character"],["the_stranger","novel"],["simba","the_lion_king"],["klaatu","the_day_the_earth_stood_still"],["neo","the_matrix"],["alien","film_series"],["doctor","doctor_who"],["robocop","character"],["el","deity"]],"members":["harry_potter","neo","robocop","simba","the_stranger","klaatu","doctor","alien","el"],"related":["Literary_technique","Allusion","Jesus","Christ","Postmodern_literature","Jim_Conklin","The_Red_Badge_of_Courage","Ernest_Hemingway","Aslan","The_Chronicles_of_Narnia","C._S._Lewis","Edmund_Pevensie","William_Golding","Frodo_Baggins","Sacrificial_lamb","Burden","Christian_cross","Via_Dolorosa","Crucifixion","Gospel","Weathertop","Witch-king","Satan","Mount_Doom","Calvary","Paradise","Harry_Potter_(character)","J._K._Rowling","Harry_Potter_universe","Muggle","Lord_Voldemort","Killing_curse","Dursleys","Chamber_of_Secrets","Cruciatus_Curse","The_Stranger_(novel)","Mufasa","The_Lion_King","Simba_(The_Lion_King)","Gethsemane","Klaatu_(The_Day_the_Earth_Stood_Still)","Neo_(The_Matrix)","Superman","Lois_Lane","The_Crucifixion","John_Connor","The_Terminator","T-800","T-1000","Spock","Ellen_Ripley","Alien_(film_series)","E.T._The_Extra-Terrestrial","Doctor_(Doctor_Who)","Doctor_Who","RoboCop_(character)","RoboCop","Superman","El_(deity)","The_Death_of_Superman","Kamui_Shir≈ç","Kadokawa_Shoten","Second_Coming","Messiah","Miraculous_births","Kamuy","Christ","Optimus_Prime","Megatron","Cybertron"]}
