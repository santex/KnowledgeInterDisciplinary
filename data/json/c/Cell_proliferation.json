When used in the context of cell division, it refers to\ngrowth of cell populations, where one cell (the \"mother cell\") grows and divides\nto produce two \"daughter cells\" (M phase). When used in the context of cell\ndevelopment, the term refers to increase in cytoplasmic and organelle volume (G1\nphase), as well as increase in genetic material before replication (G2\nphase).\n","linknr":334,"url":"Cell_proliferation","recorded":1362560230,"links":28,"instances":["protein","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.cmj.hr/2005/46/4/16100767.pdf","http://www.cmj.hr/2005/46/4/16100767.pdf"],"categories":["Cell cycle","Cellular processes"],"headings":["Cell populations","Cell size","Cell division","Cell growth disorders","Cell growth measurement methods","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Cellcycle_and_growth.png/220px-Cellcycle_and_growth.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Three_cell_growth_types.png/220px-Three_cell_growth_types.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Single_and_double_chromosomes.png/150px-Single_and_double_chromosomes.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["ki-67","protein"],["clone","genetics"]],"members":["clone","cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Daughter_cell","Exponential_growth","Generation","Cell_division","Yeast","Cell_division","Wee1","Tyrosine_kinase","Cyclin-dependent_kinase","Covalent","G2_phase","Cdc25","Pom1","Growth_factors","MTOR","Kinase","Translation","Vertebrates","Motoneuron","Motor_unit","Invertebrates","Action_potential","Myelin","Syncytium","Skeletal_muscle","Myocyte","Myoblast","Cell_adhesion","Signal_transduction","Oocyte","Endocytosis","Frog","Plant_cell","Cell_wall","Bacterium","Protozoa","Asexual_reproduction","M_phase","Cell_cycle","Enzyme","DNA_replication","Chromosomes","Protein_synthesis","Microtubules","Mitosis","Karyokinesis","Cytokinesis","Cell_membrane","Prophase","Prometaphase","Metaphase","Anaphase","Telophase","Eukaryote","Prokaryote","Bacteria","Binary_fission","Mitosis","Meiosis","Cell_nucleus","Diploid","Gamete","Male","Female","Zygote","DNA_replication","Cell_division","Haploid","Diploid","Somatic","Karyotype","Spermatozoon","Ovum","Autosome","Sex-determination_system","Sexual_reproduction","Natural_selection","Genetic_recombination","Evolution","Homozygote","Heterozygote","Hardy-Weinberg_ratio","Cancer","Microscopy","Trypan_blue","Cytometer","Flow_cytometry","Biomarker","Ki-67_(protein)","Carboxyfluorescein_diacetate","Calcein","MTT_assay","Resazurin","Toxicity","Bacterial_growth","Clone_(genetics)","Developmental_biology","Stem_cell","Cell_cycle","Binary_fission","Mitosis","Meiosis"]}
