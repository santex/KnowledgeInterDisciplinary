His mother was the Honorable Princess\nConsort Eom Seon-yeong, a palace attendant, who was posthumously awarded the\ntitle of Princess Sunheon. He was also the younger half-brother of Emperor\nSunjong and Prince Imperial Ui. He was titled Prince Imperial Yeong in 1900, and\nbecame the crown prince in 1907, despite being younger than Prince Ui. Prince\nUi's support base at court was not strong because his own mother, Lady Jang, had\nalready died.\n\nIn December 1907, he was taken to Japan on the pretext of receiving a modern\neducation. He was enrolled at GakushÅ«in and the Imperial Army Academy, both in\nTokyo. Graduating from the academy on 25 May 1917, he was commissioned a second\nlieutenant in the infantry on 25 December, and steadily rose up the ranks,\nreceiving promotions to lieutenant (April 1920), captain (July 1923) and to\nmajor (August 1928).\n\nIn 1920 he married Princess Masako of Nashimoto (born 4 November 1901 â ), the\neldest daughter of Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, on 28 April 1920 at Tokyo. In\n1910, when Korea was annexed by Japan and Emperor Sunjong was forced to\nabdicate, he was titled His [[Royal Highness]] Crown Prince of Korea. On 10\nJune 1926, upon the death of Emperor Sunjong and his funeral, he became King\nRi of Korea (demoted Korean sovereign's title after the Japan-Korean\nAnnexation Treaty).\n\nPrince Yi Eun (also known as 'Prince Ri Gin' in Japan) served in the Japanese\nArmy as Commanding Officer of the 59th Regiment, the 4th Depot Division, and\nthen later the 51st Division. He received further promotions to lieutenant\ncolonel (August 1932), colonel (1 August 1935), major general (15 July 1938) and\nto lieutenant general (2 December 1940). He also served in the Imperial Japanese\nArmy Air Force with the rank of lieutenant general, commanding 1st Air Army. He\nfurther served as Instructor at Military Staff College, attached to the\nInspectorate General of Military Training and became a Member of the Supreme War\nCouncil during wartime.\n\nAfter Korea became independent of the Empire of Japan in 1945, he requested\npermission from President Syngman Rhee to be allowed to return to Korea with his\nfamily, but was refused. The prince was offered the position of Korean\nAmbassador to the Court of St. James in 1960, but refused on the grounds of\nillness. In November 1963, President Park Chung-hee granted permission for him\nand his wife, Crown Princess Bangja, to return to Korea. By that time he was an\nunconscious from cerebral thrombosis. He received treatment at St. Mary's\nHospital in Seoul.\n\nIn his final years, he lived at Nakseon Hall, Changdeokgung Palace, the\nformer residence of Imperial house in Seoul, with Bangja and his younger\nsister Princess Deokhye. Seven years after returning to his country, he died\non 1 May 1970 at Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace, Seoul. He was buried at\nHongyureung in Namyangju, near Seoul and is known posthumously as 'Crown\nPrince Euimin of Korea'.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Crown_Prince_Euimin","recorded":1375074519,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Yi_Un&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Yi_Un&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Yi_Un","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Prince_Euimin&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Image-Crown_Prince_Euimin.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Image-Crown_Prince_Euimin.jpg","/wiki/Sunjong_of_the_Korean_Empire","/wiki/Yi_Gu","/wiki/Bangja,_Crown_Princess_Euimin_of_Korea","/wiki/Yi_Gu","/wiki/Gojong_of_the_Korean_Empire","/wiki/Deoksugung","/wiki/Seoul","/w/index.php?title=Nakseon_Hall&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Changdeok_Palace","/wiki/Seoul","/wiki/Hangul","/wiki/Hanja","/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean","/wiki/McCune%E2%80%93Reischauer","/wiki/Birth_name","/wiki/Hangul","/wiki/Hanja","/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean","/wiki/McCune%E2%80%93Reischauer","/wiki/Hangul","/wiki/Hanja","/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean","/wiki/McCune%E2%80%93Reischauer","/wiki/Lieutenant_General","/wiki/Yi_dynasty","/wiki/Crown_prince","/wiki/Korea","/wiki/Deoksugung","/wiki/Seoul","/wiki/Gojong_of_the_Korean_Empire","/wiki/Sunjong_of_Korean_Empire","/wiki/Prince_Imperial_Ui","/wiki/Gakush%C5%ABin","/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army_Academy","/wiki/Bangja,_Crown_Princess_Euimin_of_Korea","/wiki/Prince_Nashimoto_(Morimasa)","/wiki/Tokyo","/wiki/Royal_Highness","/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army","/wiki/51st_Division_(Imperial_Japanese_Army)","/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army_Air_Force","/wiki/Army_War_College_(Japan)","/wiki/Inspectorate_General_of_Military_Training","/wiki/Supreme_War_Council_(Japan)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Empire_of_Japan","/wiki/Syngman_Rhee","/wiki/Court_of_St._James","/wiki/Park_Chung-hee","/wiki/Cerebral_thrombosis","/wiki/Saint_Mary%27s_Hospital","//toolserver.org/%7Edispenser/cgi-bin/dab_solver.py?page=Yi_Un&editintro=Template:Disambiguation_needed/editintro&client=Template:Dn","/wiki/Changdeokgung","/wiki/Deokhye,_Princess_of_Korea","/w/index.php?title=Yi_Un&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hangul","/wiki/Hanja","/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean","/wiki/Bangja,_Crown_Princess_Euimin_of_Korea","/wiki/Korea","/wiki/Yi_Gu,_Prince_Imperial_Hoeun","/wiki/Hangul","/wiki/Hanja","/wiki/Revised_Romanization_of_Korean","/wiki/Julia_Mullock","/wiki/United_States","/w/index.php?title=Yi_Un&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/His_Royal_Highness","/wiki/Prince","/wiki/His_Imperial_Highness","/wiki/Crown_Prince","/wiki/Majesty","/wiki/Monarch","/w/index.php?title=Yi_Un&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.generals.dk/general/Yi/Un_Prince/Japan.html","/wiki/House_of_Yi","/wiki/Joseon_Dynasty","/wiki/Pretender","/wiki/Sunjong_of_Korea","/wiki/Emperor_of_Korea","/wiki/Japan-Korea_Annexation_Treaty","/wiki/Yi_Gu","/wiki/Template:Pretenders_to_the_Korean_throne","/wiki/Template_talk:Pretenders_to_the_Korean_throne","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Pretenders_to_the_Korean_throne&action=edit","/wiki/Pretender","/wiki/Korean_Empire","/wiki/Japan-Korea_Annexation_Treaty","/wiki/Sunjong_of_the_Korean_Empire","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Korea_1882.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Flag_of_Korea_1882.svg/120px-Flag_of_Korea_1882.svg.png","/wiki/Yi_Gu","/wiki/Yi_Won","/wiki/Yi_Seok","/wiki/House_of_Yi","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yi_Un&oldid=561911541","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1897_births","/wiki/Category:1970_deaths","/wiki/Category:House_of_Yi","/wiki/Category:Honorary_Knights_Grand_Cross_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire","/wiki/Category:Heirs_apparent_who_never_acceded","/wiki/Category:Japanese_nobility","/wiki/Category:Korean_collaborators_with_Imperial_Japan","/wiki/Category:Pretenders_to_the_Korean_throne","/wiki/Category:Korean_nobility","/wiki/Category:Japanese_generals","/wiki/Category:Zainichi_Korean_people","/wiki/Category:South_Korean_people","/wiki/Category:Korean_princes","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_Korean-language_text","/wiki/Category:Use_of_the_text_parameter_in_Infobox_Korean_name","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_links_needing_disambiguation_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:Us
