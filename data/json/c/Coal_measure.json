{"cursor":"3747","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Coal Measures' is a lithostratigraphical term for the coal-bearing part of\nthe Upper Carboniferous System. The Coal Measures Group consists of the Upper\nCoal Measures Formation, the Middle Coal Measures Formation and the Lower Coal\nMeasures Formation. The group records the deposition of fluvio-deltaic sediments\nwhich consists mainly of clastic rocks (claystones, shales, siltstones,\nsandstones, conglomerates) interstratified with the beds of coal. In most\nplaces, the Coal Measures are underlain by coarser clastic sequences known as\nMillstone Grit, of Namurian age. The top of the Coal Measures may be marked by\nan unconformity, the overlying rocks being Permian or later in age. In some\nparts of Britain, however, the Coal Measures grade up into mainly coal-barren\nred beds of late Westphalian and possibly Stephanian age. {{Citation | last =Rayner\n | first =D H last2 =Hemingway first2 =J E publication-date =1974 title =The\n | Geology and Mineral Resources Of Yorkshire publication-place =Leeds publisher\n | =Yorkshire Geological Society\n }} {{Citation | last =Edwards\n | first =W last2 =Trotter first2 =F M publication-date =1954 title =The\n | Pennines and Adjacent Areas edition =Third series =British Regional\n | Geology publication-place =London publisher =HMSO.
