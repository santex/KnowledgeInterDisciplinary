      "text" : "\n\nIn statistics, 'dependence' refers to any statistical relationship between two\nrandom variables or two sets of data. 'Correlation' refers to any of a broad\nclass of statistical relationships involving dependence.\n\nFamiliar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the\nphysical statures of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between\nthe demand for a product and its price. Correlations are useful because they can\nindicate a predictive relationship that can be exploited in practice. For\nexample, an electrical utility may produce less power on a mild day based on the\ncorrelation between electricity demand and weather. In this example there is a\ncausal relationship, because extreme weather causes people to use more\nelectricity for heating or cooling; however, statistical dependence is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the presence of such a causal relationship (i.e.,\nCorrelation does not imply causation).\n\nFormally, dependence refers to any situation in which random variables do not\nsatisfy a mathematical condition of probabilistic independence. In loose usage,\ncorrelation can refer to any departure of two or more random variables from\nindependence, but technically it refers to any of several more specialized types\nof relationship between mean values. There are several 'correlation\ncoefficients', often denoted &rho; or r, measuring the degree of correlation.\nThe commonest of these is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is\nsensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables (which may exist\neven if one is a nonlinear function of the other). Other correlation\ncoefficients have been developed to be more robust than the Pearson\ncorrelation&nbsp;– that is, more sensitive to nonlinear\nrelationships.<ref>Croxton, Frederick Emory; Cowden, Dudley Johnstone; Klein,\nSidney (1968) Applied General Statistics, Pitman.
