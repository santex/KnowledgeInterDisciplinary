Taken together, the whole body\nof cultural universals is known as the human condition. Evolutionary\npsychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all\ncultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007.\nPsychology. Worth Publishers. pp. 26 - 27 Some anthropological and\nsociological theorists that take a cultural relativist perspective may deny the\nexistence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are\n\"cultural\" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited behavior is an\nissue of \"nature versus nurture\".\n\nThese \"universals\" are unique to humans.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Cultural_universal","recorded":1362480930,"links":19,"instances":["anthropologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Culture","Human behavior","Society-related lists"],"headings":["General","List of cultural universals","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg/40px-Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["donald_brown","anthropologist"],["donald_brown","anthropologist"]],"members":["donald_brown"],"related":["Emile_Durkheim","George_Murdock","Claude_Lévi-Strauss","Donald_Brown_(anthropologist)","Human_culture","Human_condition","Evolutionary_psychology","Cultural_relativist","Ethology","Nature_versus_nurture","Upper_Paleolithic","Behavioral_modernity","Color_term","Taboo","Given_name","Kinship","Peer_group","Law","Morality","Oligarchy","Property","Gender_role","Patriarchy","Marriage","Incest","Rape","Etiquette","Inheritance","Sexual_jealousy_in_humans","Shame","Territoriality","Trade","Magical_thinking","Divination","Healing","Music","Rhythm","Dance","Body_adornment","Control_of_fire","Weapon","Cooking","Erika_Bourginon","HRAF_Press","Donald_Brown_(anthropologist)","Temple_University_Press","Joseph_H._Greenberg","Stanford_University_Press","Charles_D._Laughlin","Eugene_G._d'Aquili","Claude_Lévi-Strauss","University_of_Chicago_Press","George_P._Murdock","Charles_E._Osgood","William_S_May","Murray_S_Miron","University_of_Illinois_Press","Steven_Pinker","Penguin_Putnam","Rik_Pinxten","The_Hague"]}
