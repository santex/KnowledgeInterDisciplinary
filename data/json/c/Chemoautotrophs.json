These molecules can be organic (chemoorganotrophs)\nor inorganic (chemolithotrophs). The chemotroph designation is in contrast to\nphototrophs, which utilize solar energy. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic\nor heterotrophic.\n* 'Chemoautotrophs' (or 'chemotrophic autotroph'), ([[Ancient Greek\n  language|Gr]]: Chemo (ÏÎ·Î¼Î¯Î±) = chemical, auto (Î±á½ÏÏÏ) = self, troph (ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹Î¬) =\n  nourishment) in addition to deriving energy from chemical reactions,\n  synthesize all necessary organic compounds from carbon dioxide.\n  Chemoautotrophs use inorganic energy sources, such as hydrogen sulfide,\n  elemental sulfur, ferrous iron, molecular hydrogen, and ammonia. Most are\n  bacteria or archaea that live in hostile environments such as deep sea vents\n  and are the primary producers in such ecosystems. Evolutionary scientists\n  believe that the first organisms to inhabit Earth were chemoautotrophs that\n  produced oxygen as a by-product and later evolved into both aerobic, animal-\n  like organisms and photosynthetic, plant-like organisms. Chemoautotrophs\n  generally fall into several groups: methanogens, halophiles, sulfur oxidizers\n  and reducers, nitrifiers, anammox bacteria, and thermoacidophiles.\n  Chemolithotrophic growth could be dramatically fast, such as Thiomicrospira\n  crunogena with a doubling time around one hour.

Chemoheterotrophs can be chemolithoheterotrophs, utilizing\n  inorganic energy sources such as sulfur or chemoorganoheterotrophs, utilizing\n  organic energy sources such as carbohydrates, lipids, and\n  proteins.\n","linknr":453,"url":"Chemoautotrophs","recorded":1362665393,"links":42,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trophic ecology","Microbial growth and nutrition"],"headings":["Iron- and manganese-oxidizing bacteria","Flowchart","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg/220px-Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Troph_flowchart.png/500px-Troph_flowchart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iron(ii_oxide"]],"members":[],"related":["Atlantic_Ocean","Energy","Oxidation","Electron_donor","Organic_molecule","Chemoorganotroph","Inorganic_compound","Chemolithotroph","Phototroph","Autotroph","Heterotroph","Chemical_reaction","Carbon_dioxide","Hydrogen_sulfide","Sulfur","Iron(II)_oxide","Hydrogen","Ammonia","Bacteria","Archaea","Extremophile","Deep_sea_vent","Primary_producer","Ecosystem","Aerobic_organism","Photosynthetic","Methanogen","Halophile","Sulfur-reducing_bacteria","Nitrification","Anammox","Thermoacidophile","Doubling_time","Carbon_fixation","Carbohydrate","Lipid","Protein","Phototrophism","Prokaryotes","Igneous","Enzyme","Biotic_component","Abiotic_component","Catalytic","Manganese","Heterotroph","Autotroph","Chemoautotroph","Photoautotroph","Heterotroph","Chemoheterotroph","Photoheterotroph","Chemosynthesis"]}
