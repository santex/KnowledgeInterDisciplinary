{"cursor":"6963","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cyril Lloyd Francis' PC (March 19, 1920 â January 20, 2007) was a Canadian\npolitician and one time Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons. Francis was\nknown by his middle name.\n\nFollowing service in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, Francis\nearned a Master of Arts (MA) and doctorate (Ph.D) in economics, and lectured in\nthe discipline from 1948 to 1951 at the University at Buffalo. He then joined\nthe Department of National Health and Welfare in Ottawa as a senior economist.\n\nIn 1956, Francis and partner, lawyer Donald Sim, carrying on business as Lynhar\nDevelopments, acquired and laid out the Stinson Avenue area of Bells Corners in\nNepean. They quickly formed a partnership with William Teron, T.F.S. Lands, to\nbuild the houses in Lynwood Village. \"The City Beyond\" by Dr. Bruce Elliott,\np. 274-280\n\nThe Lynwood Plaza at Bells Corners was built by Francis and Simâs Lynhar\nDevelopments and included what would become the landmark Robinson IGA.\n\nLong time Nepean Reeve D. Aubrey Moodie, in his book, âThe Spirit of Nepeanâ\ndescribed Francis as one of the contributors to the foundation of\nNepean. \"The Spirit of Nepean,\" D. Aubrey Moodie p. 56-57 Moodie\nexplains about the introduction of lot levies, now known as development charges,\nand how they contributed to the financial stability of Nepean Township. It was\nthe transfer of large sums of money in the form of lot levies, along with\nFrancis and Teron's aggressive development activity that enabled much of\nNepean's Parkwood Hills and Bells Corners neighbourhoods to be built. To the\npleasure of some and the disdain of others, Mr. Francis was one of a list of\nindividuals credited with the introduction of lot levies as a development\nfinance tool that is relied upon to this day to fund infrastructure commensurate\nwith new residential developments.\n\nIn 1958, Francis became President of the Professional Institute of the Public\nService of Canada, a union representing civil servants in certain professions.\nIn 1959, he entered municipal politics by being elected alderman on Ottawa City\nCouncil. From 1960 to 1963, he served on the city's Board of Control and as\nDeputy Mayor.\n\nHe entered federal politics as a Liberal candidate in the 1962 election but was\ndefeated in the Ottawa-area riding of Carleton. His electoral record was mixed\nthroughout his career and he would only win election on alternate attempts.\nAccordingly, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Carleton from 1963 to\n1965 and then for Ottawa West in 1968â1972, 1974â1979 and 1980â1984.\n\nHe served as Chief Government Whip from 1970 to 1971 and then as\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs until he was\ndefeated in the 1972 election. After he returned to Parliament in the 1974\nelection, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the\nTreasury Board from 1975 to 1976.\n\nIn 1980, he became Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. He succeeded\nJeanne SauvÃ© as Speaker on January 15, 1984, when SauvÃ© became Governor\nGeneral of Canada.\n\nThe Liberal government was defeated in the 1984 election, and Francis lost his\nseat. His term as Speaker ended when the new House of Commons convened in\nNovember of that year.\n\nOn the conclusion of his term as Speaker, Francis was appointed to the Queen's\nPrivy Council for Canada. In late 1984, the new Prime Minister of Canada, Brian\nMulroney, appointed Francis to the position of Ambassador to Portugal. Francis\nreturned to Ottawa at the conclusion of his appointment in 1987.\n\nHe died in January 2007, after suffering from stomach cancer.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Cyril_Lloyd_Francis","recorded":1375081143,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cyril_Lloyd_Francis&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cyril_Lloyd_Francis&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Canadian_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)","/wiki/Doctorate","/wiki/University_at_Buffalo,_The_State_University_of_New_York","/wiki/Ottawa","#cite_note-1","/wiki/D._Aubrey_Moodie","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Alderman","/wiki/Ottawa_City_Council","/wiki/Ottawa_Board_of_Control","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_1962","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliamentary_whip","/wiki/Parliamentary_Secretary","/wiki/Minister_of_Veterans_Affairs_(Canada)","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_1972","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_1974","/wiki/President_of_the_Treasury_Board_(Canada)","/wiki/Jeanne_Sauv%C3%A9","/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_1984","/wiki/Legislative_seat","/wiki/Queen%27s_Privy_Council_for_Canada","/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada","/wiki/Brian_Mulroney","/wiki/Ambassador_(diplomacy)","/wiki/Portugal","/w/index.php?title=Cyril_Lloyd_Francis&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/D._Aubrey_Moodie","http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2007/01/22/francis.html?ref=rss","http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=bc6040a4-3f34-407a-bce1-cdc6f434dbd0&k=11891","/w/index.php?title=Cyril_Lloyd_Francis&action=edit&section=2","http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/key/SP-BL/hoc-cdc/index.asp?Language=E&param=1&id=943","http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=870ef152-7a4f-40a4-bf6b-4624641806f6&Language=E&Section=ALL","/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada","/wiki/Richard_Albert_Bell","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Carleton_(Ontario_electoral_district)","/wiki/Richard_Albert_Bell","/wiki/George_McIlraith","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Ottawa_West","/wiki/Peter_Reilly_(politician)","/wiki/Peter_Reilly_(politician)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Ottawa_West","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Binks&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ken_Binks&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Ottawa_West","/wiki/David_Daubney","/wiki/Bernard_Pilon","/wiki/Chief_Government_Whip_(Canada)","/wiki/Grant_Deachman","/wiki/G%C3%A9rald_Laniel","/wiki/Eymard_Corbin","/wiki/Lucien_Lamoureux","/wiki/Geoffrey_Franklin_Bruce","/wiki/Template:Speakers_of_the_Canadian_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Template_talk:Speakers_of_the_Canadian_House_of_Commons","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Speakers_of_the_Canadian_House_of_Commons&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg/18px-Maple_Leaf_%28from_roundel%29.svg.png","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(Canada)","/wiki/James_Cockburn_(politician)","/wiki/Timothy_Anglin","/wiki/Joseph-Goderic_Blanchet","/wiki/George_Airey_Kirkpatrick","/wiki/Joseph-Aldric_Ouimet","/wiki/Peter_White_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/James_David_Edgar","/wiki/Thomas_Bain","/wiki/Louis-Philippe_Brodeur","/wiki/Napol%C3%A9on_Belcourt","/wiki/Robert_Franklin_Sutherland","/wiki/Charles_Marcil","/wiki/Thomas_Simpson_Sproule","/wiki/Albert_S%C3%A9vigny","/wiki/Edgar_Nelson_Rhodes","/wiki/Rodolphe_Lemieux","/wiki/George_Black_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/James_Langstaff_Bowman","/wiki/Pierre-Fran%C3%A7ois_Casgrain","/wiki/James_Allison_Glen","/wiki/Gaspard_Fauteux","/wiki/William_Ross_Macdonald","/wiki/Louis-Ren%C3%A9_Beaudoin","/wiki/Roland_Michener","/wiki/Marcel_Lambert","/wiki/Alan_Macnaughton","/wiki/Lucien_Lamoureux","/wiki/James_Jerome","/wiki/Jeanne_Sauv%C3%A9","/wiki/John_Bosley_(politician)","/wiki/John_Allen_Fraser","/wiki/Gilbert_Parent","/wiki/Peter_Milliken","/wiki/Andrew_Scheer","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cyril_Lloyd_Francis&oldid=533302368","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1920_births","/wiki/Category:2007_deaths","/wiki/Category:Canadian_di
