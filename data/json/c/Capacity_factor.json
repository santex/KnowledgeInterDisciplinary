To calculate the capacity factor,\ntake the total amount of energy the plant produced during a period of time and\ndivide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity.\nCapacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of fuel that is used and the\ndesign of the plant. The capacity factor should not be confused with the\navailability factor, capacity credit (firm capacity) or with efficiency.\n","linknr":346,"url":"Capacity_factor","recorded":1362665151,"links":38,"instances":["electrical_power"],"pdf":["http://www.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36SolarP.pdf","http://www.ergo.ee.unsw.edu.au/value%20of%20PV%20in%20summer%20peaks.pdf","http://www.climatechange.sa.gov.au/uploads/pdf/Feed-in_Discussion_Paper_submissions_closed.pdf","http://www.iea.org/papers/2010/csp_roadmap.pdf","http://geo-energy.org/reports/environmental%20guide.pdf","http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/archive/03482009.pdf","http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf","http://www.ceere.org/rerl/about_wind/RERL_Fact_Sheet_2a_Capacity_Factor.pdf","http://www.bwea.com/pdf/ref_three.pdf","http://www.bwea.com/pdf/ref_three.pdf","http://iga.igg.cnr.it/documenti/IGA/Fridleifsson_et_al_IPCC_Geothermal_paper_2008.pdf","http://iga.igg.cnr.it/documenti/IGA/Fridleifsson_et_al_IPCC_Geothermal_paper_2008.pdf","http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_Ch05.pdf","http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/5955-dukes-2012-chapter-5-electricity.pdf","http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/5956-dukes-2012-chapter-6-renewable.pdf"],"categories":["Power station technology"],"headings":["Sample calculations","Reasons for reduced capacity factor","Load following power plants","Capacity factor and renewable energy","Typical capacity factors","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/3/ec32b2f1cac863ba5960eb214c652d8c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/6/7f6131b8de768b88b44d08233a2c3c2d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/9/b/a9b9da60cee6bfcaa9768ec8fdfd9562.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/6/7/b67ff3c22e50ba77caaa3cc003eb8dc7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["load_balancing","electrical_power"]],"members":["load_balancing"],"related":["Power_plant","Nameplate_capacity","Energy","Fuel","Availability_factor","Betz'_law","Base_load_power_plant","Megawatt","Megawatt-hour","Burton_Wold_Wind_Farm","Enercon","Wind_turbine","Nameplate_capacity","Horns_Rev_2","Siemens_Wind_Power","Three_Gorges_Dam","Hoover_Dam","United_States_Bureau_of_Reclamation","Geothermal_power","Nuclear_power","Fossil_fuel_power_plant","Bioenergy","Peaking_power_plant","Embodied_energy","Dispatchable_generation","Load_following_power_plant","Spot_price","Load_balancing_(electrical_power)","Variable_renewable_energy","Wind_farm","Solar_power_plant","Load_following_power_plant","Renewable_energy","Solar_power","Wind_power","Hydroelectricity","Wind","Sunlight","Water","Fish","Availability_factor","Wind_farm","Solar_energy","SolarPACES","International_Energy_Agency","Solar_power_in_Spain","Solar_power_plants_in_the_Mojave_Desert","Solar_thermal_power","Geothermal","Geothermal_electricity","Department_of_Energy_and_Climate_Change","CCGT","Nuclear_power_plants","Fossil-fuel_power_station","Hydroelectricity","Wind_power","Photovoltaic_power_station","Energy_storage","Intermittent_power_source","Demand_factor"]}
