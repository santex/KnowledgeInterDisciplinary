It connects North London, starting at Camden Road\nnear the junction with Holloway Road, and central London's Pentonville Road in\nthe south. It is often known colloquially as the '\"Cally\"' and forms the\nentirety of the 'A5203'.\n\nThe street is mostly residential from Camden Road until Caledonian Road tube\nstation. There are many new residential developments around the station\nincluding student accommodation. Just south of the station is Pentonville Prison\nnear the bridge carrying the North London Line. South of here, the road is\nmostly lined by a wide variety of shops and cafes including several Ethiopian\nrestaurants. This area is quite poor compared to the north end and the shops\nserve both the council estates bordering the road and the more affluent\nBarnsbury area adjacent to the east, mostly Georgian terraces. The road crosses\nThornhill Bridge over the Regents Canal and south of here are more trendy shops\nand restaurants that have appeared in recent years because of the King's Cross\nCentral developments. The road ends at Pentonville Road near King's Cross\nrailway station and the border of Camden. Housmans Bookshop, specialist radical\nbook and magazine retailers established in 1945, can be found here at No.5, as\nwell as the offices of [[Peace News]] and the small anarchist organisation\nLondon Greenpeace, the people behind the McLibel Trial.\n\nIt was the subject of an hour-long episode in the 2012 BBC and Open University\nco-production, The Secret History of Our Streets, which chose the Caledonian\nRoad as a typical London example.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Caledonian_Road_(London)","recorded":1362686329,"links":13,"instances":["great_britain","eighteenth_century_north_london_turnpike_road","hm_prison"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Streets in Islington"],"headings":["History","Transport","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Caledonian_Road%2C_N1_-_geograph.org.uk_-_413958.jpg/220px-Caledonian_Road%2C_N1_-_geograph.org.uk_-_413958.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pentonville","hm_prison"],["new_road","eighteenth_century_north_london_turnpike_road"],["great_north_road","great_britain"]],"members":["great_north_road","new_road","pentonville"],"related":["London_Borough_of_Islington","North_London","Camden_Road","Holloway_Road","Central_London","Pentonville_Road","Caledonian_Road_tube_station","Pentonville_(HM_Prison)","North_London_Line","Cuisine_of_Ethiopia","Council_housing","Barnsbury","Georgian_architecture","Terraced_housing","Regents_Canal","King's_Cross_Central","London_King's_Cross_railway_station","London_Borough_of_Camden","Housmans_Bookshop","London_Greenpeace","McLibel_Trial","BBC","Open_University","Toll_road","New_Road_(eighteenth_century_north_London_turnpike_road)","Great_North_Road_(Great_Britain)","West_End_of_London","Royal_Caledonian_School","Pentonville_Prison","Smithfield,_London","City_of_London_Corporation","Metropolitan_Cattle_Market","Caledonian_Road_tube_station","Caledonian_Road_and_Barnsbury_station"]}
