{"cursor":"2612","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Colony-stimulating factors' (CSFs) are secreted glycoproteins that bind to\nreceptor proteins on the surfaces of hemopoietic stem cells, thereby activating\nintracellular signaling pathways that can cause the cells to proliferate and\ndifferentiate into a specific kind of blood cell (usually white blood cells. For\nred blood cell formation, see erythropoietin).\n\nThey may be synthesized and administered exogenously. However, such molecules\ncan at a latter stage be detected, since they differ slightly from the\nendogenous ones in, e.g., features of posttranslational modification.\n","linknr":519,"url":"Colony_stimulating_factors","recorded":1362504333,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokines"],"headings":["Etymology","Mechanism","Examples","Clinical Uses","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Glycoprotein","Hemopoietic_stem_cells","Intracellular_signaling","Cell_growth","Cellular_differentiation","Blood_cell","White_blood_cells","Erythropoietin","Posttranslational_modification","Cell_culture","Macrophages","Macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor","Hematopoietic_microenvironment","Paracrine","Endocrine","Autocrine","Macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor","Granulocyte_macrophage_colony-stimulating_factor","Sargramostim","Granulocyte_colony-stimulating_factor","Filgrastim","Promegapoietin"]}
