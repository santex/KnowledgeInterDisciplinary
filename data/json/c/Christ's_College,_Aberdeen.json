{"cursor":"2575","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Christ's College, Aberdeen' was one of three colleges in Scotland founded by\nthe Free Church of Scotland for the training of ministers following the\nDisruption of 1843. The other two were New College, Edinburgh and\nTrinity College, Glasgow.\n\nFollowing the Church reunion of 1929, Christ's College became a Church of\nScotland college and was also integrated into the University of Aberdeen. It now\nis based within the University's King's College campus in Old Aberdeen. The\nCollege's former buildings in the west end of Aberdeen are no longer used by the\nchurch or university.\n\nThe post of Master of Christ's College is still a Church of Scotland\nappointment, but for most purposes it is closely connected with the University\nof Aberdeen's School of Divinity, History and Philosophy. The current Master is\nthe Rev. Professor\n[http://www.abdn.ac.uk/divinity/staff/details.php?id=j.swinton John Swinton];\nthe previous Master was the Very Rev Professor Iain R. Torrance - a former\nModerator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and now President of\nPrinceton Theological Seminary, USA.\n\nThe principal role of Christ's College is to oversee the preparation and\nformation of ministerial candidates for the Church of Scotland. From its offices\nin the University of Aberdeen, the College collaborates closely with the\ndivinity faculty to ensure candidates receive appropriate academic training for\nthe ministry, funding a lectureship in Practical Theology, organizing extramural\nlectures and seminars, and hosting an annual lecture at the beginning of each\nacademic year. In addition, the College maintains the Divinity Library, which\nserves all undergraduates within the department. It also contributes to the\nspiritual life of the university, organising a weekly Chapter Service during\neach academic term.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Christ's_College,_Aberdeen","recorded":1375066474,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Christ%27s_College_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843-1900)","/wiki/Disruption_of_1843","#cite_note-1","/wiki/New_College,_Edinburgh","/wiki/Trinity_College,_Glasgow","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Old_Aberdeen","http://www.abdn.ac.uk/divinity/staff/details.php?id=j.swinton","/wiki/Iain_R._Torrance","/wiki/Moderator_of_the_General_Assembly_of_the_Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Princeton_Theological_Seminary","/w/index.php?title=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Aberdeen","/w/index.php?title=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~wad005/guide.shtml","/wiki/Template:University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Template_talk:University_of_Aberdeen","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:University_of_Aberdeen&action=edit","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Ancient_university_governance_in_Scotland","/wiki/Chancellor_(education)","/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall","/wiki/Rector_of_the_University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Principal_(university)","/wiki/Ian_Diamond","/wiki/General_Council_(Scottish_university)","/wiki/University_Court","/wiki/Academic_Senate","/wiki/File:Oldkingsaberdeen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Oldkingsaberdeen.jpg/240px-Oldkingsaberdeen.jpg","/wiki/King%27s_College,_Aberdeen","/wiki/Bishop_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Hector_Boece","/wiki/William_Elphinstone","/wiki/Marischal_College","/wiki/George_Keith,_5th_Earl_Marischal","/wiki/Aberdeen_doctors","/wiki/University_of_the_Highlands_and_Islands","/wiki/Glasgow_and_Aberdeen_Universities_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Category:People_associated_with_the_University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/List_of_Professorships_at_the_University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen,_College_of_Arts_and_Social_Sciences","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen,_College_of_Life_Sciences_and_Medicine","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen,_College_of_Physical_Sciences","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen_School_of_Law","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen_School_of_Medicine","/wiki/Aberdeen_University_Sport_and_Recreation","/wiki/Cruickshank_Botanic_Garden","/wiki/Elphinstone_Hall","/wiki/King%27s_Museum","/wiki/Marischal_Museum","/wiki/Aberdeen_University_Students%27_Association","/wiki/Aberdeen_University_Sports_Union","/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/The_Lairig_Club","/wiki/Aberdeen_University_Men%27s_Hockey_Club","/wiki/Aberdeen_University_Rugby_Football_Club","/wiki/Aberdeen_University_Shinty_Club","/w/index.php?title=Aberdeen_Student_Radio&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Aberdeen_Universities_Officer_Training_Corps","/wiki/Gaudie","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&params=57_9_50_N_2_5_57_W_region:GB_type:landmark","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&oldid=519922206","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Category:University_of_Aberdeen","/wiki/Category:Bible_colleges,_seminaries_and_theological_colleges_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Educational_institutions_established_in_1846","/wiki/Category:1846_establishments_in_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Christ%27s+College%2C+Aberdeen&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Christ%27s+College%2C+Aberdeen","/wiki/Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen","/w/index.php?title=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Christ%27s_College,_Aberdeen&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events",
