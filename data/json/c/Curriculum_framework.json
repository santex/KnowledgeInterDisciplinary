The framework is the first step, defining clear, high\nstandards which will be achieved by all students. The curriculum is then aligned\nto the standards, and students are assessed against the standards. As compared\nwith traditional education which is concerned only about delivering content, a\nstandards based education reform system promises that all will succeed if all\nare held to high expectations. When the standards are reached, there will be no\nachievement gap where some groups are allowed to score lower than others, or the\ndisabled are offered different opportunities than others. All will meet world\nclass standards and be qualified for good colleges and trained for good jobs\nwhich pay good wages. In a traditional education system, the curriculum was\ndefined by those who created textbooks rather than government bodies which\nassembled groups of stakeholders to create standards based on consensus of what\nstudents should know and be able to do.\n\nIn some states, curriculum frameworks have been adopted based on traditional\nacademic standards rather than outcome-based constructivist standards, but many\nframeworks were originally or still based on student-centered learning and\nconstructivism such as reform mathematics, whole language and Inquiry-based\nScience which have been controversial in some states and communities. High\nschool graduation examinations tie awarding of diplomas to demonstration of\nmeeting the standards set out in the frameworks.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Curriculum_framework","recorded":1362559200,"links":12,"instances":["ncf_2005"],"pdf":["http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MichiganCurriculumFramework_8172_7.pdf"],"categories":["Education reform","Standards-based education"],"headings":["National Curriculum Frameworks","State Curriculum Frameworks","See also","Notes"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["national_curriculum_framework","ncf_2005"]],"members":["national_curriculum_framework"],"related":["Outcome-based_education","Outcome-based_education","Standards_based_education_reform","Traditional_education","Standards_based_education_reform","Achievement_gap","Traditional_education","Reform_mathematics","Whole_language","Inquiry-based_Science","High_school_graduation_examination","NCERT","National_Curriculum_Framework_(NCF_2005)","Standards_based_education_reform","Victorian_Essential_Learning_Standards"]}
