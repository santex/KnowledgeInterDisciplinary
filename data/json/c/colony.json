For colonies in antiquity, city-states would often found\ntheir own colonies. Some colonies were historically countries, while others were\nterritories without definite statehood from their inception. The metropolitan\nstate is the state that owns the colony. In Ancient Greece, the city that\nfounded a colony was called the metropolis. Mother country is a reference to the\nmetropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony.\nThere is a United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.\n\nA colony is mostly ruled by another state or can be run independently. Unlike a\npuppet state or satellite state, a colony has no independent international\nrepresentation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the\nmetropolitan state.\n\nThe term \"informal colony\" is used by some historians to describe a country\nwhich is under the de facto control of another state, although this description\nis often contentious.\n","linknr":729,"url":"colony","recorded":1362572580,"links":81,"instances":["country_subdivision","person","architecture","roman"],"pdf":["http://charma.uprm.edu/~angel/Puerto_Rico/reporte_status.pdf","http://charma.uprm.edu/~angel/Puerto_Rico/reporte_status.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32933.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32933.pdf","http://www.oslpr.org/2009-2012/leyes/pdf/ley-283-28-Dic-2011.pdf"],"categories":["Administrative divisions","Colonialism|*"],"headings":["Definitions","Colonies in ancient civilizations (examples)","Modern colonies (examples, organized alphabetically)","Current colonies (examples)","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Non-Self-Governing.png/400px-Non-Self-Governing.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/STS034-76-88.jpg/220px-STS034-76-88.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Trust_and_Non-Self-Governing_Territories.djvu/page1-225px-Trust_and_Non-Self-Governing_Territories.djvu.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg/150px-Emblem_of_the_United_Nations.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/16px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["territory","country_subdivision"],["colonus","person"],["colonia","roman"],["capital","architecture"],["canada_under_british_rule","1763–1867"]],"members":["territory","colonus","canada_under_british_rule","capital","colonia"],"related":["Politics","History","Territory_(country_subdivision)","Sovereign_state","Colonies_in_antiquity","City-state","Metropolis","Ancient_Greece","United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories","Puppet_state","Satellite_state","Colonus_(person)","Cologne","Colonia_(Roman)","Belgrade","York","Capital_(architecture)","Ancient_peoples_of_Italy","Alexandria","Carthage","Phoenicia","Cyrene,_Libya","Santorini","Durrës","Marseille","Cologne","United_States","James_Cook","First_Fleet","Penal_colony","Federation_of_Australia","France","New_France","Canada_under_British_rule_(1763–1867)","Canadian_Confederation","Special_Administrative_Region_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China","China","India","Portugal","United_Kingdom","Imperial_Japan","Hong_Kong","Special_Administrative_Region_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China","China","World_War_II","Indigenous_peoples","Filipino_people","Polynesians","Song_Dynasty","Dutch_Formosa","Koxinga","Ming_Dynasty","Kingdom_of_Tungning","Qing_Dynasty","Taiwan_under_Qing_Dynasty_rule","Fujian_Province","Empire_of_Japan","First_Sino-Japanese_War","Government_of_the_Republic_of_China","Communist_Party_of_China","Acts_of_Union_1707","Thirteen_Colonies","British_America","Colony_of_Virginia","U.S._state","Virginia","Kentucky","West_Virginia","Fort_Madison,_Nuku_Hiva","Nuku_Hiva","Monrovia","Channel_Islands","Duchy_of_Normandy","Dependent_area","Chile","Morocco","British_Virgin_Islands","Gibraltar","Falkland_Islands","Crown_Colonies","United_States_Congress","Unincorporated_territory","New_Zealand","Internal_colony","United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories","Space_colonization","Settler_colonialism","British_overseas_territories","Proprietary_colony","Commonwealth"]}
