{"cursor":"4331","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research' (CDER, pronounced \"see'-der\") is a\ndivision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that monitors most drugs\nas defined in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Some biological products are\nalso legally considered drugs, but they are covered by the Center for Biologics\nEvaluation and Research. The center reviews applications for new and generic\npharmaceuticals, manages US current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)\nregulations for pharmaceutical manufacturing, determines which medications\nrequire a medical prescription, monitors advertising of approved medications,\nand collects and analyzes safety data about pharmaceuticals that are already on\nthe market.\n\nCDER reviews New Drug Applications to ensure that the drugs are safe and\neffective. Its primary objective is to ensure that all prescription and over-the-\ncounter (OTC) medications are safe and effective when used as directed.\n\nCDER receives considerable public scrutiny, and thus implements processes that\ntend toward objectivity and tend to isolate decisions from being attributed to\nspecific individuals. In keeping with this, reviews are generally staffed by\nteams that are intended to come to consensus on decisions. The decisions on\napproval will often make or break a small company's stock price (e.g., Martha\nStewart and Imclone), so the markets closely watch CDER's decisions.\n\nThe center has around 1,300 employees in \"Review teams\" that evaluate and\napprove new drugs. Additionally, the CDER employs a \"safety team\" with 72\nemployees to determine whether new drugs are unsafe or present risks not\ndisclosed in the product's labeling.\n\nThe FDA's budget for approving, labeling, and monitoring drugs is roughly $290\nmillion per year. The safety team monitors the effects of more than 3,000\nprescription drugs on 200 million people with a budget of about $15 million a\nyear. The FDA requires a four phased series of clinical trials, with phase three\nbeing the largest and usually requiring 1,000-3,000 patients.\n\nJanet Woodcock, M.D. is the director of CDER.
