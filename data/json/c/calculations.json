Estimating\nthe fair price for financial instruments using the Black–Scholes model is a\ncomplex algorithmic calculation.\n\nStatistical estimations of the likely election results from opinion polls also\ninvolve algorithmic calculations, but produces ranges of possibilities rather\nthan exact answers.\n\nTo calculate means to ascertain by computing. The English word derives from the\nLatin calculus, which originally meant a small stone in the gall-bladder (from\nLatin calx). It also meant a pebble used for calculating, or a small stone used\nas a counter in an abacus (Latin abacus, Greek abax). The abacus was an\ninstrument used by Greeks and Romans for arithmetic calculations, preceding the\nslide-rule and the electronic calculator, and consisted of perforated pebbles\nsliding on an iron bars.\n","title":"Calculation","headings":["Comparison to computation","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Abacus","2: Computation","1: Arithmetic","1: Algorithm","1: Heuristics","1: Multiplication","1: Financial_instruments","1: BlackâScholes","1: Statistical_estimation","1: Latin","1: Greek_language","1: English_language","1: Calculator","1: Complexity_class","1: Cost_accounting","1: List_of_algorithms","1: Mathematics","1: Mental_calculation","1: Ibn_al-Banna'_al-Marrakushi"]}
