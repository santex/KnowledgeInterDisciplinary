It\noriginated as the combination of two open-source projects: Celtix developed by\nIONA Technologies (acquired by Progress Software in 2008) and XFire developed by\na team hosted at Codehaus. These two projects were combined by people working\ntogether at the Apache Software Foundation. The name CXF derives from combining\nthe \"Celtix\" and \"XFire\" project names.\n\nThe CXF key design considerations include: *Clean separation of front-ends, like\nJAX-WS, from the core code. *Simplicity with, for instance, the creation of\nclients and endpoints without annotations. *High performance with minimum\ncomputational overhead. *Embeddable Web service component: example embeddings\ninclude Spring Framework and Geronimo.\n\nCXF is often used with Apache ServiceMix, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ in\nservice-oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure projects.\n","title":"Apache%20CXF","headings":["Features","Commercial support","See also","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Apache_Software_Foundation","2: Open_source_software","2: JAX-WS","2: OSGi","1: Cross-platform","1: Web_Services","1: Apache_License","1: Web_services","1: Celtix","1: IONA_Technologies","1: Progress_Software","1: Codehaus_XFire","1: Codehaus","1: Front-end_and_back-end","1: Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services","1: Source_code","1: Computational_overhead","1: Spring_Framework","1: Apache_Geronimo","1: Apache_ServiceMix","1: Apache_Camel","1: Apache_ActiveMQ","1: Service-oriented_architecture","1: SOAP","1: WS-Addressing","1: WS-Policy","1: WS-ReliableMessaging","1: WS-SecureConversation","1: WS-Security","1: WS-SecurityPolicy","1: Web_Services_Description_Language_","1: JAX-RS","1: Representational_State_Transfer","1: JavaScript","1: Apache_Maven_","1: CORBA","1: HTTP","1: JBI","1: Java_EE","1: Apache_Tomcat","1: GlassFish_Metro","1: Apache_Axis","1: Apache_Wink","1: List_of_web_service_frameworks"]}
