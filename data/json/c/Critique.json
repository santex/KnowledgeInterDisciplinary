Critique is commonly understood as fault finding and negative\njudgement, Rodolphe GaschÃ© (2007)\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=_CZVDv6bdXIC&pg=PA12 The honor of thinking:\ncritique, theory, philosophy] pp.12-3 quote:  but it can also involve\nmerit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical\npractice of doubt. The contemporary sense of critique\nhas been largely influenced by the Enlightenment critique of prejudice and\nauthority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and\npolitical authorities. Critique is an accepted format\nof written and oral debate.\n\nSome authors draw a distinction between critique and criticism. The distinction\nis not made in French, German, or Italian, where the two words both translate as\ncritique, Kritik, and critica, respectively. Gianni\nVattimo [http://books.google.com/books?id=i7QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA57 Postmodern\ncriticism: postmodern critique] in David Wood (1990) Writing the future, pp.57-\n8 According to philosopher Gianni Vattimo, criticism is used more\nfrequently to denote literary criticism or art criticism, that is the\ninterpretation and evaluation of literature and art; while critique may be used\nin the English language to refer to more general and profound writing as Kant's\n[[Critique of pure reason]]. Another proposed\ndistinction is that critique is never personalized nor ad hominem, but is\ninstead the analyses of the structure of the thought in the content of the item\ncritiqued. This analysis then offers by way of the critique method either a\nrebuttal or a suggestion of further expansion upon the problems presented by the\ntopic of that specific written or oral argumentation. Even authors that believe\nthere might be a distinction, say that there is some ambiguity that is still\nunresolved.\n\nCritique is an accepted and established process of orderly scholarly and public\ndebate. In the fine arts and the humanities, and especially in writing,\ncritique is influenced by the scientific method of analysis. Critique is based\nupon an informed opinion, and never upon personal opinion. Informed opinion is\naccepted as being technical knowledge, personal or professional experience, or\nspecified training.\n\nThe term 'critique' derives, via French, from Ancient Greek (), meaning \"the\nfaculty of judgement\", that is, discerning the value of persons or things.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Critique","recorded":1362664884,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aesthetics","Art history","Criticism","Entertainment occupations","Humanities occupations"],"headings":["In Philosophy and its applications","The Strength and Weakness of a Critique","Critical Theory","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Socrates.png/18px-Socrates.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.png/28px-Nuvola_apps_package_graphics.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Discourse","Rodolphe_Gasché","Age_of_Enlightenment","Debate","Criticism","Gianni_Vattimo","Gianni_Vattimo","Literary_criticism","Art_criticism","Kant","Ad_hominem","Scientific_method","Philosophy","Immanuel_Kant","Modern_philosophy","Concept","Theory","Discipline","Validity","Dogma","Hegel","Doctrine","Karl_Marx","Writing","Conventionality","Butterfly_effect_in_popular_culture","Frankfurt_School","Critical_theory","Jürgen_Habermas","Cultural_studies","Racism","Gender_bias","Michel_Foucault","Alasdair_MacIntyre","Critic"]}
