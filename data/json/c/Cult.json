{"cursor":"68276","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'s church-sect typology, upon which the modern concept of cults, sects, and new\nreligious movements is based.]] :This article gives a general cultural account\nof \"cult\". For its usage in the original sense of \"veneration\" or \"religious\npractice\" see [[Cult (religious practice)]]. For religious groups with modern\norigins see [[New religious movement]]. For religion in general see\n[[Religion]]. For other uses see [[Cult (disambiguation)]].\n\nThe word 'cult' in current popular usage is a pejorative term for a new\nreligious movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered\nabnormal or bizarre by the larger society. OED, citing American Journal of\nSociology 85 (1980), p. 1377: \"Cults[...], like other deviant social movements,\ntend to recruit people with a grievance, people who suffer from a some variety\nof deprivation.\" The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices.\nThe word was first used in the early 17th century denoting homage paid to a\ndivinity and borrowed via the French culte from Latin cultus \"worship\", from the\nadjective cultus \"inhabited, cultivated, worshipped\", derived from the verb\ncolere \"care, cultivate.\" http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/cult\n\nIn the 1930s cults became the object of sociological study in the context of the\nstudy of religious behavior. They have been criticized by mainstream Christians\nfor their unorthodox beliefs. In the 1970s the anticult movement arose, partly\nmotivated by acts of violence and other crimes committed by members of some\ncults. Some of the claims of the anti-cult movement have been disputed by other\nscholars, leading to further controversies.\n\nDiscrimination against cult members has been an ongoing issue in some nations,\nas well as concerns about doomsday cults and destructive cults. Governments have\nundertaken various policies towards cults, ranging from tolerance to hostility,\nand this has also been a source of controversy.\n","linknr":1004,"url":"Cult","recorded":1362477186,"links":48,"instances":["bhagwan_shree_rajneesh","sociologist","language","sociologist","religious_practice","religion","uk","politician","scholar"],"pdf":["http://www.regeringen.se/info_rosenbad/departement/social/sou98_113/s98_113.pdf","http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/Analysis_of_China_Docs_1_to_7.pdf","http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/67820.pdf","http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/67820.pdf"],"categories":["Cults|"],"headings":["Origins
