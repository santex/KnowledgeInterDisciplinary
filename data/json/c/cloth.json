Yarn is produced by spinning raw fibres of wool, flax, cotton,\nor other material to produce long strands.<ref></ref> Textiles are formed by\nweaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, or pressing fibres together (felt).\n\nThe words 'fabric' and 'cloth' are used in textile assembly trades (such as\ntailoring and dressmaking) as synonyms for textile. However, there are subtle\ndifferences in these terms in specialized usage. Textile refers to any material\nmade of interlacing fibres. Fabric refers to any material made through weaving,\nknitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding that may be used in production of\nfurther goods (garments, etc.). Cloth may be used synonymously with fabric but\noften refers to a finished piece of fabric used for a specific purpose (e.g.,\ntable cloth).\n",
