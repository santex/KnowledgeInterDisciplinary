{"cursor":"19948","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Chemical engineering' is the branch of engineering that applies the physical\nsciences (e.g., chemistry and physics) and/or life sciences (e.g., biology,\nmicrobiology and biochemistry) together with mathematics and economics to\nprocesses that convert raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable\nforms. In addition, modern chemical engineers are also concerned with pioneering\nvaluable materials and related techniques â which are often essential to related\nfields such as nanotechnology, fuel cells and biomedical engineering. From\nPetroleum to Penicillin. The First Hundred Years of Modern Chemical Engineering:\n1859â1959. â Burnett, J. N. Within chemical engineering, two broad\nsubgroups include 1) design, manufacture, and operation of plants and machinery\nin industrial chemical and related processes (\"chemical 'process' engineers\");\nand 2) development of new or adapted substances for products ranging from foods\nand beverages to cosmetics to cleaners to pharmaceutical ingredients, among many\nother products (\"chemical 'product' engineers\").\n","linknr":829,"url":"Chemical_Engineering","recorded":1362506914,"links":86,"instances":["chemical_engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~che/links/The%20early%20history%20of%20chemical%20engineering-%20a%20reassessment.pdf","http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~che/links/The%20early%20history%20of%20chemical%20engineering-%20a%20reassessment.pdf","http://www.clarkson.edu/~wilcox/Design/evolvche.pdf","http://www.clarkson.edu/~wilcox/Design/evolvche.pdf","http://www.clarkson.edu/~wilcox/Design/evolvche.pdf","http://www.clarkson.edu/~wilcox/Design/evolvche.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical
