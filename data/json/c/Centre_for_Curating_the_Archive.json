{"cursor":"2351","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Centre for Curating the Archive', at the University of Cape Town, began\nlife as LLAREC (The Lucy Lloyd Archive, Resource and Exhibition Centre) in\n1996 http://www.humanities.uct.ac.za/research/groupings/llarec/ as a\nspace in which material, both original and reproduced, created and found, was\ncollected from a variety of archives, museums, collections, storerooms,\noffices and junk heaps and used creatively to curate exhibitions by artist-\nstaff at The Michaelis School of Fine Art. In 2008 it expanded its activities\nto include a photographic unit, and it is now a centre which actively works\nwith many different kinds of collections, developing curatorship as a creative\nsite of knowledge. Projects, publications and courses aim, through practice,\nto open up novel combinations of the historically separated domains of the\ncreative arts and the truth-claiming discourses of history and the social and\nnatural sciences.\n\nThe CCA is located in the Old Medical School Building on the Hiddingh Campus in\nthe city of Cape Town. It neighbours the Iziko South African Museum and South\nAfrican National Gallery, the Company Gardens of Cape Town, The Labia Theatre\nand the Drama Department of UCT. The CCA includes spaces for conservation,\ndigital workstations, photographic reproduction, storage, documentation, the\nplanning and constructing of exhibitions, research and teaching.\n\nFundamental to the work of the CCA is the recognised need to both conserve and\nmake collections accessible to artists, scholars and students. This is achieved\nthrough careful curatorship and high-quality digital documentation of\ncollections; developing web-access, publications and the staging of exhibitions\nand public events. At the heart of the Centre is the understanding of\ncollections and archives as important sites of knowledge, as products of\ntraditions of art, ideas and values, as well as of the social and political\ncircumstances of both their making and reception. The CCA works with several\ninstitutions in the realisation of its projects and curates exhibitions both in\nSouth Africa and abroad.\n","linknr":85,"url":"Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","recorded":1374541041,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/University_of_Cape_Town","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=The_Michaelis_School_of_Fine_Art&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Iziko_South_African_Museum","/wiki/South_African_National_Gallery","/w/index.php?title=The_Labia_Theatre&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.humanities.uct.ac.za/research/groupings/llarec/","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit&section=2","http://www.cca.uct.ac.za/","http://www.humanities.uct.ac.za/research/groupings/llarec/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&oldid=561064912","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:University_of_Cape_Town","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive","/wiki/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/wiki/Talk:Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","#","/wiki/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&oldid=561064912","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&id=561064912","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive&oldid=561064912&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["University
