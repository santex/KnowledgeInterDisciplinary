usually small, social unit of any size that shares common values. The\nterm can also refer to the national community or international community, and 2)\nin biology, a community is a group of interacting living organisms sharing a\npopulated environment.\n\nIn human communities, intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, risks, and\na number of other conditions may be present and common, affecting the identity\nof the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.\n\nSince the advent of the Internet, the concept of community has less geographical\nlimitation, as people can now gather virtually in an online community and share\ncommon interests regardless of physical location. Prior to the internet, virtual\ncommunities (like social or academic organizations) were far more limited by the\nconstraints of available communication and transportation technologies.\n\nThe word \"community\" is derived from the Old French communité which is derived\nfrom the Latin [[communitas]] (com, \"with/together\" + munus, \"gift\"), a broad\nterm for fellowship or organized society.<ref>\"community, n.\" OED Online.
