{"cursor":"29533","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n showing the four cardinal directions, the four ordinal directions, plus eight\n further divisions.]]\n\nThe four 'cardinal directions' or 'cardinal points' are the directions of north,\neast, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials: N, E, S, W. East and\nwest are at right angles to north and south, with east being in the direction of\nrotation and west being directly opposite. Intermediate points between the four\ncardinal directions form the points of the compass. The intermediate\n(intercardinal, or ordinal) directions are north-east (NE), south-east (SE), south-\nwest (SW), and north-west (NW).\n\nOn Earth, upright observers facing north will have south behind them, east on\ntheir right, and west on their left. Most devices and methods for orientation\ntherefore operate by finding north first, although any other direction is\nequally valid, if it can be reliably located. Several of these devices and\nmethods are described below.\n","linknr":628,"url":"Compass_direction","recorded":1362569209,"links":100,"instances":["radio","classical_element","angle","chinese_constellation","navigation","classical_element","photography","astronomy","classical_element","geometry","geometry","navigation","classical_element","astronomy","asia","classical_element"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Orientation"],"headings":["Locating
