The campaign\nwas created by advertising agency Grey London, and centres around a 120-second\ncommercial starring Keira Knightley. The commercial was supported by poster and\nonline components. Cut was directed by Joe Wright and produced by Dominic\nDelaney. Post-production work was handled by Big Buoy and Prime Focus. The\ncampaign drew a significant amount of media attention, especially after\nadvertising approval body Clearcast prohibited the short film from appearing on\neven post-watershed television, due to several particularly violent scenes. The\ntitle of the piece refers to the filmmaking practice of cutting.\n","linknr":296,"url":"Cut_(advertisement)","recorded":1362674411,"links":14,"instances":["crime","television","transition","magazine","internet","photographer","musician"],"pdf":["http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends54%5C0001054154_ac_20080331_e_c.pdf"],"categories":["2009 works","Advertisements"],"headings":["Sequence","Background and production","Release and reception","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Cut_ad_poster.jpg/220px-Cut_ad_poster.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Keira_Knightley_2005.jpg/220px-Keira_Knightley_2005.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chris_clark","musician"],["watershed","television"],["cut","transition"],["rankin","photographer"],["battery","crime"],["watershed","television"],["hit","internet"],["campaign","magazine"]],"members":["battery","watershed","cut","campaign","hit","rankin","chris_clark"],"related":["Newspaper_advertisement","Women's_Aid_Federation_of_England","Grey_London","Joe_Wright","Keira_Knightley","Body_Riddle","Chris_Clark_(musician)","English_language","United_Kingdom","United_Kingdom","Advertising_campaign","Charitable_organization","Women's_Aid_Federation_of_England","Domestic_violence","Advertising_agency","Grey_London","Keira_Knightley","Joe_Wright","Clearcast","Watershed_(television)","Cut_(transition)","Keira_Knightley","Set_construction","Leading_actor","Zoom_lens","Tagline","Cut!","Grey_London","Women's_Aid_Federation_of_England","Feminist","Euro","Newspaper_advertising","Billboard","Radio_advertisement","Rankin_(photographer)","Anna_Friel","Honor_Blackman","Cosmetics","Battery_(crime)","Joe_Wright","Chanel","BAFTA","Make-up_artist","Ivana_Primorac","Cinematography","Seamus_McGarvey","Academy_Award","Watershed_(television)","BBFC","Clearcast","Pearl_&_Dean","Digital_Cinema_Media","Admedia","Microsite","Video_sharing","YouTube","Creative_director","Cannes_Lions_International_Advertising_Festival","Hit_(internet)","Cannes_Lions_International_Advertising_Festival","Women's_shelter","Yasmin_Alibhai-Brown","Kira_Cochrane","Campaign_(magazine)","USA_Today","Marketwire","Business_Standard","The_Oregonian","YouTube"]}
