{"cursor":"6123","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Carbon nanofoam' is an allotrope of carbon discovered in 1997 by Andrei V. Rode\nand co-workers at the Australian National University in Canberra. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon\natoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web.\n\nEach cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon atoms\nlinked in graphite-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the\ninclusion of heptagons among the regular hexagonal pattern. This is the opposite\nof what happens in the case of buckminsterfullerenes, in which carbon sheets are\ngiven positive curvature by the inclusion of pentagons.\n\nThe large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an aerogel,\nbut with 1% of the density of previously produced carbon aerogelsâor only a few\ntimes the density of air at sea level. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam\nis a poor electrical conductor. The nanofoam contains numerous unpaired\nelectrons, which Rode and colleagues propose is due to carbon atoms with only\nthree bonds that are found at topological and bonding defects. This gives rise\nto what is perhaps carbon nanofoam's most unusual feature: it is attracted to\nmagnets, and below â183 Â°C can itself be made magnetic.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Carbon_nanofoam","recorded":1362375371,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/rode_04_unconventional.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/rode_04_unconventional.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/gamaly_04_nanostructures.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/gamaly_04_nanostructures.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/rode_05_strong.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/rode_05_strong.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/arcon_06_origin.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/arcon_06_origin.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/blinc_06_13c.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/blinc_06_13c.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/rode_06_magnetic.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/rode_06_magnetic.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/lau_07_high.pdf","http://laserspark.anu.edu.au/Pubs/lau_07_high.pdf"],"categories":["Carbon forms","Semiconductors","Nanomaterials"],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Allotropes_of_carbon","Andrei_V._Rode","Australian_National_University","Canberra","Atom","Graphite","Heptagon","Hexagon","Buckminsterfullerene","Pentagon","Aerogel","Air","Sea_level","Electrical_conductivity","Unpaired_electron","Curie_point"]}
