He is the\nfirst Mercian king mentioned by Bede in his [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis\nAnglorum]].\n\nCearl's ancestry is unknown. He is not included in the Mercian royal genealogy; [[Anglo-\nSaxon Chronicle]], under the year 626, in which Penda's ancestry is\nlisted. Henry of Huntingdon in the 12th century placed him as ruling after\nPybba, saying that he was not Pybba's son but was his kinsman. Henry of\nHuntingdon, Historia Anglorum, translated by Diana Greenway (1997), Book II,\nchapter 27 (page 111). Greenway notes that Henry presumably concluded that Cearl\nwas not in the direct royal line, based on ASC 626, and \"fitted him in between\nthe father and son\" (note 111).\n\nBede (2.14) mentions him only in passing, as the father-in-law of Edwin of\nDeira. According to Bede, Edwin married Cwenburh (Quenberga), daughter of\n\"Cearl, king of the Mercians\" while he was in exile, and with her had two sons,\nOsfrith and Eadfrith. Bede, [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis\nAnglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]], [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-\nbook2.html Book II, Chapter XIV.] Historians have noted the marriage as\nevidence for Cearl's independence from the then-Northumbrian king Ãthelfrith,\nsince Edwin was Ãthelfrith's rival and Cearl would not have married his daughter\nto an enemy of his overlord. Nicholas Brooks, \"The Formation of the Mercian\nKingdom\", in S. Bassett, The Origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms (1989), page 166;\nFrank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (1943), third edition (1971), reissued\npaperback (Oxford University Press, 1998), pages 38–39; see also N.J.\nHigham, An English empire: Bede and the early Anglo-Saxon kings (1995), pp.\n143–151. The [[Historia Britonum]] credits the later king Penda with\nfirst separating the Mercians from the Northumbrians, but if Cearl was able to\nmake this marriage to Ãthelfrith's enemy he must not have been subject to\nhim—possibly any subject relationship only developed at a later date. The\nhistorian D. P. Kirby speculated that perhaps Cearl was enabled to marry his\ndaughter to Edwin due to the protection of the powerful East Anglian king\nRaedwald, and that Edwin's subsequent exile among the East Angles may have been\ndue to Ãthelfrith's power beginning \"to impinge on Cearl or his successors among\nthe Mercians\". D. P. Kirby, The Earliest English Kings (1991), revised\nedition (2000), pages 55 and 61.\n\nIt has been suggested that Cearl's kinship suffered a catastrophe between the\ntime of the Battle of Chester c.616 and the appearance of his successor, Penda,\nson of Pybba. Indeed, it is possible that Cearl may have been involved in that\nconflict, which may have effectively ended his overkingship of Mercia until the\nrise of Penda. Higham, N. J., King Cearl, the Battle of Chester and the\norigins of the Mercian \"Overkingship\" Midland History (1992), pages 1-15\n\nWhether Cearl reigned until Penda became king is unknown. Penda was in power by\n633 (and possibly by 626, if the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] is correct). It is\nalso unknown what relationship Cearl had to Penda, if any. That Cearl married\nhis daughter to Edwin could be evidence that he and Penda were rivals, since\nPenda later fought against and defeated Edwin (in alliance with Cadwallon of\nGwynedd). Ann Williams, Alfred P. Smyth, and D. P. Kirby, A Biographical\nDictionary of Dark Age Britain (1991), page 74.\n\nMore evidence could be seen for a dynastic rivalry between Cearl and Penda in\nPenda's later execution (according to Bede) of Eadfrith, a captured son of Edwin\nwho was Cearl's grandson through Cwenburh. Although Penda's reason is unknown,\nthe killing of Eadfrith is often seen as the result of pressure from the\nNorthumbrian king Oswald, to whom Eadfrith would have represented a threat; it\nis, however, also possible that Penda may have decided that Eadfrith's lineage\nmade him unsuitable for use as a puppet against Oswald, since he would represent\na threat to Penda's own position through his descent from Cearl.
