It occurs when the propositions, taken\ntogether, yield two conclusions which form the logical, usually opposite\ninversions of each other. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic,\nAristotle's law of noncontradiction states that \"One cannot say of something\nthat it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time.\"\n\nBy extension, outside of classical logic, one can speak of contradictions\nbetween actions when one presumes that their motives contradict each other.\n","title":"contradiction","headings":["History","Contradiction in formal logic","Contradictions and philosophy","Contradiction outside formal logic","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Falsum","1: Square_of_opposition","1: Term_logic","1: Classical_logic","1: Proposition","1: Logical_consequence","1: Aristotle","1: Law_of_noncontradiction","1: Plato","1: Socrates","1: Robert_Maynard_Hutchins","1: EncyclopÃ¦dia_Britannica","1: Chicago","1: Propositional_logic","1: First-order_logic","1: If_and_only_if","1: Principle_of_explosion","1: Completeness","1: Unsatisfiable","1: Barbershop_paradox","1: Q.E.D.","1: Consistency_proof","1: Axiomatic_system","1: Emil_Post","1: Propositional_calculus","1: Ernest_Nagel","1: James_R._Newman","1: Deduction_system","1: Modus_ponens","1: Mutually_exclusive","1: Collectively_exhaustive_events","1: Epistemology","1: Coherentism","1: Belief","1: System","1: Dialetheism","1: Graham_Priest","1: Nietzsche","1: Moore's_paradox","1: Self_refuting_idea","1: Performative_contradiction","1: Zen","1: Koan","1: Dialectical_materialism","1: Karl_Marx","1: Hegelianism","1: Dialectic#Modern_philosophy","1: Aufheben","1: Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis","1: Capitalism","1: Socialism","1: Means_of_production","1: Proletariat","1: Colloquialism","1: Presupposition","1: Proof_by_contradiction","1: Mathematics","1: Mathematical_proof","1: Doublethink","1: Irony","1: Oxymoron","1: Paraconsistent_logic","1: Paradox","1: Truth","1: JÃ³zef_Maria_BocheÅski"]}
