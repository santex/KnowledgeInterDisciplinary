It is a\ngraphical tool for organizing and representing knowledge.\n\nConcepts, usually represented as boxes or circles, are connected with labeled\narrows in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between\nconcepts can be articulated in linking phrases such as \"gives rise to\", \"results\nin\", \"is required by,\" or \"contributes to\". Joseph D. Novak &\nAlberto J.
