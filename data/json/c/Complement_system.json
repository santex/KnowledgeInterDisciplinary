{"cursor":"25923","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe complement system helps or âcomplementsâ the ability of antibodies and\nphagocytic cells to clear pathogens from an organism. It is part of the immune\nsystem called the innate immune system that is not adaptable and does\nnot change over the course of an individual's lifetime. However, it can be\nrecruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system.\n\nThe complement system consists of a number of small proteins found in the\nblood, generally synthesized by the liver, and normally circulating as inactive\nprecursors (pro-proteins). When stimulated by one of several triggers,\nproteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and\ninitiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end-result of this\nactivation cascade is massive amplification of the response and activation of\nthe cell-killing membrane attack complex. Over 25 proteins and protein\nfragments make up the complement system, including serum proteins, serosal\nproteins, and cell membrane receptors. They account for about 5% of the\nglobulin fraction of blood serum.\n\nThree biochemical pathways activate the complement system: the classical\ncomplement pathway, the alternative complement pathway, and the lectin\npathway.\n","linknr":551,"url":"Complement_system","recorded":1362512999,"links":42,"instances":["complement","blood","molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Complement system|*"],"headings":["History","Functions of the Complement","Overview","Activation of complements by antigen-associated antibody","Regulation of the complement system","Role in disease","Modulation by infections","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Complement_death.PNG/200px-Complement_death.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Complement-pathways.png/270px-Complement-pathways.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["amplification","molecular_biology"],["serum","blood"],["c3","complement"]],"members":["c3","serum","amplification"],"related":["Phagocytic","Pathogens","Immune_system","Innate_immune_system","Adaptive_immune_system","Liver","Pro-proteins","Proteases","Cytokines","Amplification_(molecular_biology)","Activation","Membrane_attack_complex","Blood_plasma","Serous_membrane","Proteins","Serum_globulins","Metabolic_pathway","Classical_complement_pathway","Alternative_complement_pathway","Lectin_pathway","Hans_Ernst_August_Buchner","Serum_(blood)","Bacteria","Jules_Bordet","Component","Paul_Ehrlich","Antigens","Antigen","Immune_receptor","Protease","C3-convertase","C3_(complement)","Phagocyte","Opsonization","C5a","Chemokine","Cytokine","Acylation_stimulating_protein","Carboxypeptidase_B","Anaphylatoxin","Degranulation","Mast_cell","Smooth_muscle","Complement_membrane_attack_complex","Complement_component_6","Complement_component_7","C8_complex","Complement_component_9","Osmosis","Kupffer_cells","Horseshoe_crab","Classical_complement_pathway","IgM","IgG","Antigen","C1Q_complex","Complement_component_1S","Complement_component_4","Complement_component_2","C1-inhibitor","Decay_accelerating_factor","Glycophosphatidylinositol","Paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria","Alternate_complement_pathway","Complement_component_3","Factor_H","Complement_factor_I","Complement_factor_B","Factor_D","Properdin","CD35","CD46","CD55","CD59","Innate_immunity","Anaphylatoxin","Membrane_attack_complex","Lectin","Mannose-binding_lectin","Ficolin","Pathogen-associated_molecular_patterns","PAMP","Complement_control_protein","CD59","Protectin","Membrane_attack_complex","C1-inhibitor","Barraquer-Simons_Syndrome","Asthma","Lupus_erythematosus","Glomerulonephritis","Arthritis","Autoimmune_heart_disease","Multiple_sclerosis","Alzheimer's_disease","Autoimmune_disease","Infection","Neisseria_meningitidis","Membrane_attack_complex","Gram-negative","Factor_H","Membrane_cofactor_protein","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Age-related_macular_degeneration","Complement_component_3","Complement_factor_B","Complement_factor_I","Age-related_macular_degeneration","Hereditary_angioedema","Total_complement_activity","Human_Immunodeficiency_Virus","Acquired_Immunodeficiency_Syndrome"]}
