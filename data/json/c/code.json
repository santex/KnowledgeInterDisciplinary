For example, semaphore,\nwhere the configuration of flags held by a signaller or the arms of a semaphore\ntower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters and numbers.\nAnother person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and\nreproduce the words sent.\n","title":"code","headings":["Theory","Examples","Other examples","Codes and acronyms","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Code_word","2: Information","2: Data_compression","2: Algorithm","2: Huffman_coding","2: Telegraphy","2: Phonics","1: Word","1: Phrase","1: Gesture","1: Covert","1: Sign","1: Communication","1: Information_processing","1: Communication_source","1: Plain_language","1: Flag_semaphore","1: Semaphore_line","1: Information_theory","1: Computer_science","1: Formal_language_theory","1: Total_function","1: Homomorphism#Homomorphisms_and_e-free_homomorphisms_in_formal_language_theory","1: Concatenation","1: Entropy_encoding","1: Country_calling_codes","1: ISBN","1: UMTS","1: W-CDMA","1: Kraft's_inequality","1: Error_detection_and_correction","1: Hamming_code","1: Reed–Solomon","1: Reed–Muller","1: Walsh–Hadamard_code","1: BCH_code","1: Turbo_code","1: Golay_code","1: Goppa_code","1: Low-density_parity-check_code","1: Space–time_code","1: Length","1: Pronounceability","1: Black_Chamber","1: Herbert_Yardley","1: Morse_code","1: ASCII","1: Computer","1: Computer_terminal","1: Computer_printer","1: Binary_numeral_system","1: Bit","1: Byte","1: Code_page","1: Code_point","1: Unicode","1: UTF-8","1: Biology","1: DNA","1: Genes","1: Proteins","1: Genetic_code","1: Codon","1: Nucleotides","1: Amino_acids","1: Mathematics","1: Gödel_code","1: Gödel","1: Incompleteness_theorem","1: Mathematical_notation","1: Natural_number","1: Gödel_numbering","1: Traffic_lights","1: Electronic_color_code","1: Resistor","1: Marketing","1: Coupon","1: Cornet","1: Sign_language","1: Braille","1: Sheet_music","1: Music","1: Chess","1: Chess_notation","1: History_of_cryptography","1: Cipher","1: Secret_code","1: Cognition","1: Content_format","1: Data","1: Markup_language","1: Text_Encoding_Initiative","1: Semantics_encoding","1: Encoder","1: Data_storage_device","1: Codec","1: Neural_encoding","1: Neurons","1: Television_encoding","1: NTSC","1: PAL","1: SECAM","1: Parsing","1: Decoding_methods","1: Digital_signal_processing","1: Digital-to-analog_converter","1: Acronym","1: Language","1: International_Air_Transport_Association_airport_code","1: Bag_tag","1: Station_code","1: Journalism","1: –30–","1: Asemic_writing","1: Equipment_codes","1: Quantum_error_correction","1: Semiotics"]}
