It is the first stand-alone web\nseries launched by a major television network. The series stars Tony\nHale (of [[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]) as a typical\noffice-working, self-confidence lacking nerd who discovers he can undo things\n(as well as employ other keyboard functions) in real life.\n\nIt is an adaptation and expansion of the short film [[Ctrl Z (short film)|Ctrl\nZ]] by director Robert Kirbyson which was a winner at the Sundance Film\nFestival in 2008.\n\nCTRL was spotted and developed by SXM from the original short film CTRL Z which\nscreened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. SXM ultimately partnered with\nNBC's digital studio to produce the online series. After NBC shut the digital\nstudio in 2011 all rights reverted back to SXM who are currently developing\nSeason 2 with Yahoo and a private investor.\n\nAs of early 2012, the episodes appear to have been removed from the NBC website,\nbut can be found on Hulu.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Ctrl_(web_series)","recorded":1362477649,"links":10,"instances":["film","actor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Comedy web series","Science fiction web series","2009 American television series debuts","2009 American television series endings","Time travel television series","NBC network shows","American web series"],"headings":["Cast","Episodes","Games","External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["steve_howey","actor"],["steve_howey","actor"],["spider-man","film"]],"members":["steve_howey"],"related":["Sci_Fi","Comedy","Tony_Hale","Steve_Howey_(actor)","Emy_Coligado","Cat_Jahnke","English_language","NBC.com","NBC_Universal_Television_Distribution","NBC.com","United_States","Television_comedy","Web_series","NBC","Tony_Hale","Robert_Kirbyson","Sundance_Film_Festival","Hulu","Tony_Hale","Steve_Howey_(actor)","Emy_Coligado","Edgar_Morais","Richard_Karn","Scott_L._Schwartz","Spider-Man_(film)","Nestea"]}
