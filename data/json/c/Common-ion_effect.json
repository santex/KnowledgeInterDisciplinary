{"cursor":"4245","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'common ion effect' is responsible for the reduction in solubility of an\nionic precipitate when a soluble compound combining one of the ions of the\nprecipitate is added to the solution in equilibrium with the precipitate. It\nstates that if the concentration of any one of the ions is increased, then,\naccording to Le Chatelier's principle, the ions in excess should combine with\nthe oppositely charged ions. Some of the salt will be precipitated until the\nionic product is equal to the solubility of the product. In simple words, common\nion effect is defined as the suppression of the degree of dissociation of a weak\nelectrolyte containing a common ion.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Common-ion_effect","recorded":1362486066,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Equilibrium chemistry","Solutions"],"headings":["Solubility effects","Buffering effect","Exceptions","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Equilibrium.svg/15px-Equilibrium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["copper(i_chloride"]],"members":[],"related":["Le_Chatelier's_principle","Silver_chloride","Sodium_chloride","Drinking_water","Chalk","Limestone","Aquifers","Hard_water","Water_treatment","Sodium_carbonate","Calcium_carbonate","Toothpaste","Salting_out","Soap","Fatty_acid","Ionic_strength","Sodium","PH","Sodium_acetate","Acetic_acid","Acetate_ion","Strong_electrolyte","Weak_acid","Le_Chatelier's_principle","Chemical_equilibrium","Copper(I)_chloride","Hydrochloric_acid","Coordination_complex"]}
