{"cursor":"8616","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" for two genotypes. Genotype B shows a strongly bimodal distribution indicating\n differentiation into distinct phenotypes. Each phenotype is buffered against\n environmental variation - it is canalised.]] 'Canalisation' (or 'canalization')\n is a measure of the ability of a population to produce the same phenotype\n regardless of variability of its environment or genotype. In other words, it\n means robustness. The term 'canalisation' was coined by C. H. Waddington, who\n used the word to capture the fact that \"developmental reactions, as they occur\n in organisms submitted to natural selection...are adjusted so as to bring about\n one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions during the\n course of the reaction\". He used this word rather than robustness to\n take into account that biological systems are not robust in the quite the same\n way as, for example, engineered systems.\n\nBiological robustness or canalisation comes about when developmental pathways\nare shaped by evolution. Waddington introduced the epigenetic landscape, in\nwhich the state of an organism rolls \"downhill\" during development. In this\nmetaphor, a canalised trait is illustrated as a valley enclosed by high ridges,\nsafely guiding the phenotype to its \"fate\". Waddington claimed that canals form\nin the epigenetic landscape during evolution, and that this heuristic is useful\nfor understanding the unique qualities of biological robustness.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Canalisation_(genetics)","recorded":1362483232,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology","Genetics","Population genetics"],"headings":["Genetic assimilation","Congruence hypothesis","Evolutionary capacitance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Trait-scale-bimodal.png/313px-Trait-scale-bimodal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Population","Phenotype","Genotype","C._H._Waddington","Epigenetic_landscape","Genetic_assimilation","Drosophila_melanogaster","Pupa","Artificial_selection","Genetic_assimilation","Genetic_assimilation","Quantitative_genetics","Genotype-phenotype_map","Mutational_robustness","Evolvability","Evolutionary_capacitance","Developmental_biology","Developmental_noise","Developmental_systems_theory","Evolutionary_developmental_biology","Evolutionary_capacitance","Evolvability","Gene_regulatory_network","Phenotypic_plasticity","Systems_biology"]}
