Color derives from the spectrum of light (distribution of light power\nversus wavelength) interacting in the eye with the spectral sensitivities of the\nlight receptors. Color categories and physical specifications of color are also\nassociated with objects, materials, light sources, etc., based on their physical\nproperties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. By\ndefining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by their\ncoordinates.\n\nBecause perception of color stems from the varying spectral sensitivity of\ndifferent types of cone cells in the retina to different parts of the spectrum,\ncolors may be defined and quantified by the degree to which they stimulate these\ncells. These physical or physiological quantifications of color, however, do not\nfully explain the psychophysical perception of color appearance.\n\nThe science of color is sometimes called 'chromatics', 'chromatography',\n'colorimetry', or simply 'color science'. It includes the perception of color by\nthe human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art,\nand the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what\nwe commonly refer to simply as [[light]]).\n","title":"color","headings":["Physics","Perception","Associations","Spectral colors and color reproduction","Additive coloring","Subtractive coloring","Structural color","Additional terms","See also","References","External links and sources"]},"micro-relation":["4: Human_eye","4: Red","4: Blue","3: Wavelength","3: Color_space","3: Green","3: Nanometre","3: International_Commission_on_Illumination","3: Hue","2: Light","2: Photoreceptor_cell","2: Retina","2: Electromagnetic_radiation","2: Yellow","2: Purple","2: Isaac_Newton","2: Brent_Berlin","2: Paul_Kay","2: Pink","2: Color_constancy","2: Trichromacy","2: Color_wheel","2: Complementary_color","2: Chromaticity_diagram","2: Primary_color","2: Tints_and_shades","1: American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-our,_-or","1: Visual_perception","1: Physical_property","1: Humans","1: Spectrum_of_light","1: Spectral_sensitivity","1: Cone_cells","1: Physiological","1: Psychophysics","1: Colorimetry","1: Color_theory","1: Art","1: Physics","1: Infrared","1: Ultraviolet","1: Frequency","1: Luminous_intensity","1: Rainbow","1: Optical_spectrum","1: Latin","1: Visible_light","1: Monochromatic_color","1: Hertz","1: Vacuum","1: Refraction","1: Language","1: University_of_California_Press","1: Brown","1: Specular_reflection","1: Scattering","1: Transparency_and_translucency","1: Fluorescence","1: Phosphorescence","1: Light_emitting_diodes","1: List_of_light_sources","1: Aristotle","1: Color_vision","1: Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe","1: James_Clerk_Maxwell","1: Hermann_von_Helmholtz","1: MIT_Press","1: Ewald_Hering","1: Opponent_process","1: Color_blindness","1: Lateral_geniculate_nucleus","1: Cone_cell","1: Rod_cell","1: Black-and-white","1: Kruithof_curve","1: Ventral_stream","1: Opponent_processes","1: Qualia","1: Spider","1: Marsupial","1: Bird","1: Reptile","1: Fish","1: Synesthesia","1: Grapheme-color_synesthesia","1: Functional_neuroimaging","1: Afterimage","1: Vincent_van_Gogh","1: Color_palette","1: Edwin_Land","1: CIECAM02","1: ICAM","1: Brightness","1: Russian_language","1: Italian_language","1: National_colors","1: Color_symbolism","1: Color_psychology","1: Chromotherapy","1: Alternative_medicine","1: Dominant_wavelength","1: Magenta","1: Fruit","1: Tomato","1: CIE_1931_color_space","1: Color_printing","1: Gamut","1: Color_management","1: ICC_profile","1: Additive_color","1: Subtractive_color","1: Black","1: Tyndall_effect","1: Opal","1: Diffraction_grating","1: Thin-film_optics","1: Iridescence","1: Peacock","1: Soap_bubbles","1: Mother_of_pearl","1: Electron_microscope","1: Photonic","1: Colorfulness","1: Dichromatism","1: Chromophore","1: Color_mapping","1: Impossible_color","1: International_Color_Consortium","1: List_of_colors","1: Neutral_color","1: Pearlescent_coating","1: Secondary_color","1: Tertiary_color","1: Buenos_Aires_University","1: Robert_Ridgway","1: Albert_Henry_Munsell","1: International_Colour_Association"]}
