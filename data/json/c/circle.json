It can also be defined as the locus of a point\nequidistant from a fixed point.\n\nA circle is a simple closed curve which divides the plane into two regions: an\ninterior and an exterior. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used\ninterchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole\nfigure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is the\nformer and the latter is called a disk.\n\nA circle can be defined as the curve traced out by a point that moves so that\nits distance from a given point is constant.\n\nA circle may also be defined as a special ellipse in which the two foci are\ncoincident and the eccentricity is 0. Circles are conic sections attained\nwhen a right circular cone is intersected by a plane perpendicular to the\naxis of the cone.\n\n<!--To avoid layout breaking when TOC is hidden-->\n","title":"circle","headings":["Terminology","History","Analytic results","Properties","Circle of Apollonius","Circles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures","Circle as limiting case of other figures","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Diameter","3: Tangent","2: Radius","2: Ellipse","2: Conic_section","2: Circumference","2: Secant_line","2: Circular_segment","2: Mathematical_constant","2: Isoperimetric_inequality","2: Pythagorean_theorem","2: Complex_plane","2: Unit_circle","2: Circumcircle","2: Inscribed_angle","2: Right_angle","2: Sphere","1: Shape","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Curve","1: Conical_surface","1: Connected_space","1: Endpoint","1: Circular_sector","1: Semicircle","1: Creation_myth","1: Circus","1: Astronomical","1: Wheel","1: Gear","1: Astronomy","1: Science","1: Geometry","1: Astrology_and_astronomy","1: History_of_science_in_the_Middle_Ages","1: Rhind_papyrus","1: Euclid's_Elements","1: Plato","1: Seventh_Letter","1: Ferdinand_von_Lindemann","1: Transcendental_number","1: Squaring_the_circle","1: Pi","1: Irrational_number","1: Area_of_a_disk","1: Archimedes","1: Circumscribe","1: Calculus_of_variations","1: Cartesian_coordinate_system","1: Coordinate_system","1: Equation","1: Parametric_equation","1: Trigonometric_function","1: Parametric_variable","1: Stereographic_projection","1: Homogeneous_coordinates","1: Complex_projective_plane","1: Circular_points_at_infinity","1: Polar_coordinates","1: Generalised_circle","1: Tangent_line","1: Implicit_differentiation","1: Reflection_symmetry","1: Rotational_symmetry","1: Symmetry_group","1: Orthogonal_group","1: Circle_group","1: Great_circle","1: Unit_sphere","1: Riemannian_circle","1: Cartesian_coordinates","1: Line_segment","1: Thales'_theorem","1: Versine","1: Supplementary_angles","1: Central_angle","1: Apollonius_of_Perga","1: Angle_bisector_theorem","1: Interior_angle","1: Exterior_angle","1: Cross-ratio","1: Midpoint","1: Triangle","1: Incircle_and_excircles_of_a_triangle","1: Tangential_quadrilateral","1: Convex_polygon","1: Cyclic_polygon","1: Cyclic_quadrilateral","1: Hypocycloid","1: Cartesian_oval","1: Weighted_sum","1: Superellipse","1: Cassini_oval","1: Curve_of_constant_width","1: Affine_sphere","1: Apeirogon","1: List_of_circle_topics","1: Cut-the-knot"]}
