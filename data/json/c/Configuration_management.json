{"cursor":"22159","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Configuration management' (CM) is a process for establishing and maintaining\nconsistency of a product's performance,functional and physical attributes with\nits requirements, design and operational information throughout its\nlife. The CM process is widely used by military\nengineering organizations to manage complex systems, such as weapon systems,\nvehicles, and information systems. Outside the military, the CM process is also\nused with IT service management as defined by ITIL, resp. ISO/IEC 20000, and\nwith other domain models in the civil engineering and other industrial\nengineering segments such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, and\nbuildings.\n","linknr":302,"url":"Configuration_management","recorded":1362538689,"links":37,"instances":["project_management","software","configuration_management","software","computer_scientist"],"pdf":["http://www.product-lifecycle-management.com/download/MIL-HDBK-61B%20(Draft).pdf","http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//little_book_full_colour.pdf","http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//little_book_full_colour.pdf","http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/~yang/495ppt/config_management.pdf","http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/~yang/495ppt/config_management.pdf","http://www.iu.hio.no/~mark/papers/paper1.pdf","http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/sysadmtheory3.pdf","http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/immunity.pdf"],"categories":["Configuration management|","Method engineering","Technical communication","Revision control systems","Computer occupations"],"headings":["Introduction","History","Overview","Software","Maintenance systems","Standards","Guidelines","Construction","See also","Certification","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/ConfiurationActivityModel.png/400px-ConfiurationActivityModel.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["baseline","configuration_management"],["puppet","software"],["chef","software"],["mark_burgess","computer_scientist"],["dependency","project_management"]],"members":["dependency","puppet","baseline","chef","mark_burgess"],"related":["Engineering","Complex_system","Weapon","Information_system","ITIL","ISO/IEC_20000","Domain_model","Civil_engineering","Industrial_engineering","Road","Bridge","Canal","Dam","Building","Reverse_engineering","United_States_Air_Force","United_States_Department_of_Defense","United_States_Military_Standard","Technical_standards","Standards_organization","Systems_engineering","Integrated_Logistics_Support","Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration","ISO_9000","Prince2","COBIT","Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library","Product_lifecycle_management","Application_Lifecycle_Management","Change_management","System","Program_management","System_lifecycle","Baseline_(configuration_management)","Physical_configuration_audit","Information_assurance","National_Information_Systems_Security_Glossary","Network_firewall","Network_firewall","Operating_system","CFEngine","Bcfg2","Puppet_(software)","Chef_(software)","Mark_Burgess_(computer_scientist)","CFEngine","Enterprise_asset_management","Condition_monitoring","Federal_Standard_1037C","IEEE_829","Change_detection","Granular_Configuration_Automation","Comparison_of_open_source_configuration_management_software","Dependency_(project_management)","List_of_software_engineering_topics","Netconf","Network_management","Programming_tool","Revision_control","Software_engineering","Interchangeable_parts"]}
