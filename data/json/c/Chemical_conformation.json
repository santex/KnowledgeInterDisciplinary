{"cursor":"2818","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'chemical structure' includes molecular geometry, electronic structure and\ncrystal structure of molecules. Molecular geometry refers to the spatial\narrangement of atoms in a molecule and the chemical bonds that hold the atoms\ntogether. Molecular geometry can range from the very simple, such as diatomic\noxygen or nitrogen molecules, to the very complex, such as protein or DNA\nmolecules. Molecular geometry can be roughly represented using a structural\nformula. Electronic structure describes the occupation of a molecule's\nmolecular orbitals.\n\nThe theory of chemical structure was developed in the 1850s and 1860s by\nseveral chemists, including Friedrich August Kekule, Archibald Scott Couper,\nand Aleksandr Butterov. These chemists demonstrated that the chemical\ncompounds are not composed of random clusters of atoms and functional groups,\nbut have structures with a definite order formed according the valency of the\ncomposing atoms.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Chemical_conformation","recorded":1362371343,"links":24,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.chem.uwec.edu/Chem406_F06/Pages/lecture_notes/lect07/C406-lect07-notes.pdf"],"categories":["Chemistry","Analytical chemistry"],"headings":["Structure determination","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["valency","chemistry"]],"members":["valency"],"related":["Molecular_geometry","Electronic_structure","Crystal_structure","Molecule","Atom","Molecule","Chemical_bond","Diatomic","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Protein","DNA","Structural_formula","Molecular_orbital","Friedrich_August_Kekule","Archibald_Scott_Couper","Aleksandr_Butterov","Valency_(chemistry)","Atoms","Chemistry","KiB","Spectroscopy","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Infrared_spectroscopy","Raman_spectroscopy","Electron_microscopy","X-ray_crystallography","X-ray_diffraction","Optical_resolution","Crystal","Structural_elucidation","X-ray_diffraction","Proton_NMR","Carbon-13_NMR","Mass_spectrometry","Infrared_spectroscopy","Electron-spin_resonance","Cyclic_voltammetry","Electron_absorption_spectroscopy","X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy","Pauli_exclusion_principle","Lipinski's_Rule_of_Five","QSAR","Chemical_property","Molecular_property","Physical_property","Crystallographic_database"]}
