Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas, but, being colorless, odorless, tasteless,\nand initially non-irritating, it is very difficult for people to detect. Carbon\nmonoxide is a product of incomplete combustion of organic matter due to\ninsufficient oxygen supply to enable complete oxidation to carbon dioxide\n(CO 2). It is often produced in domestic or industrial settings by\nolder motor vehicles and other gasoline-powered tools, heaters, and cooking\nequipment. Exposures at 100 ppm or greater can be dangerous to human health.\n\nSymptoms of mild acute poisoning include lightheadedness, confusion, headaches,\nvertigo, and flu-like effects; larger exposures can lead to significant toxicity\nof the central nervous system and heart, and even death. Following acute\npoisoning, long-term sequelae often occur. Carbon monoxide can also have severe\neffects on the fetus of a pregnant woman. Chronic exposure to low levels of\ncarbon monoxide can lead to depression, confusion, and memory loss. Carbon\nmonoxide mainly causes adverse effects in humans by combining with hemoglobin to\nform carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) in the blood. This prevents oxygen binding to\nhemoglobin, reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to\nhypoxia. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are\nthought to be adversely affected. Carboxyhemoglobin can revert to hemoglobin,\nbut the recovery takes time because the HbCO complex is fairly stable.\n\nTreatment of poisoning largely consists of administering 100% oxygen or\nproviding hyperbaric oxygen therapy, although the optimum treatment remains\ncontroversial. Oxygen works as an\nantidote as it increases the removal of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin, in turn\nproviding the body with normal levels of oxygen. The prevention of poisoning is\na significant public health issue. Domestic carbon monoxide poisoning can be\nprevented by early detection with the use of household carbon monoxide\ndetectors. Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal poisoning\nin many countries. Historically, it was\nalso commonly used as a method to commit suicide, usually by deliberately\ninhaling the exhaust fumes of a running car engine. Modern automobiles, even\nwith electronically-controlled combustion and catalytic converters, can still\nproduce levels of carbon monoxide which will kill if enclosed within a garage or\nif the tailpipe is obstructed (for example, by snow) and exhaust gas cannot\nescape normally. Carbon monoxide poisoning has also been implicated as the cause\nof apparent haunted houses; symptoms such as delirium and hallucinations have\nled people suffering poisoning to think they have seen ghosts or to believe\ntheir house is haunted.\n","linknr":1482,"url":"Carbon_monoxide_poisoning","recorded":1362581545,"links":47,"instances":["band","mood","physiology","medical","medical","medical","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/carbonmonoxide-factsheet.pdf","http://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/carbonmonoxide-factsheet.pdf","http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf","http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/co/pdfs/faqs.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/co/pdfs/faqs.pdf","http://www.iom-world.org/pubs/IOM_TM1102.pdf"],"categories":["Toxic
