Levy M.\n(1997) CALL: context and conceptualisation, Oxford: Oxford University\nPress. CALL embraces a wide range of ICT applications and approaches to\nteaching and learning foreign languages, from the \"traditional\" drill-and-\npractice programs that characterised CALL in the 1960s and 1970s to more recent\nmanifestations of CALL, e.g. as used in a virtual learning environment and Web-\nbased distance learning. It also extends to the use of corpora and\nconcordancers, interactive whiteboards, Schmid Euline\nCutrim (2009) Interactive whiteboard technology in the language classroom:\nexploring new pedagogical opportunities, SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany: VDM Verlag Dr.\nMÃ¼ller.

CALI fell out of favour among language teachers, however, as it\nappeared to imply a teacher-centred approach (instructional), whereas language\nteachers are more inclined to prefer a student-centred approach, focusing on\nlearning rather than instruction. CALL began to replace CALI in the early 1980s\n(Davies & Higgins 1982: p. 3) Davies G. & Higgins J. (1982) Computers,\nlanguage and language learning, London: CILT. and it is now incorporated\ninto the names of the growing number of professional associations worldwide.\n\nAn alternative term, Technology-enhanced language learning (TELL), Bush M. &\nTerry R. (1997) (eds.) Technology-enhanced language learning, Lincolnwood,\nIllinois: National Textbook Company. also emerged around the early 1990s:\ne.g. the TELL Consortium project, University of Hull.\n\nThe current philosophy of CALL puts a strong emphasis on student-centred\nmaterials that allow learners to work on their own. Such materials may be\nstructured or unstructured, but they normally embody two important features:\ninteractive learning and individualised learning. CALL is essentially a tool\nthat helps teachers to facilitate the language learning process. It can be used\nto reinforce what has been already been learned in the classroom or as a\nremedial tool to help learners who require additional support.\n\nThe design of CALL materials generally takes into consideration principles of\nlanguage pedagogy and methodology, which may be derived from different learning\ntheories (e.g. behaviourist, cognitive, constructivist) and second language\nlearning theories such as Stephen Krashen's monitor hypothesis.\n\nA combination of face-to-face teaching and CALL is usually referred to as\nblended learning. Blended learning is designed to increase learning potential\nand is more commonly found than pure CALL (Pegrum 2009: p. 27). Pegrum\nM.
