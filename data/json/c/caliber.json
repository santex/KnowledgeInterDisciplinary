      "text" : "\n\nIn guns, particularly firearms, 'caliber' or 'calibre' is the approximate\ninternal diameter of the barrel, or the diameter of the projectile it fires. In\na rifled barrel, the distance is measured between opposing lands or grooves;\ngroove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the\nUnited States, while land measurements are more common elsewhere. Good\nperformance requires that a bullet closely match the groove diameter of a barrel\nto ensure a good seal. When the barrel diameter is given in inches, the\nabbreviation \"cal\" is used in place of \"inches.\" For example, a small bore rifle\nwith a diameter of 0.22&nbsp;inch is a .22 cal; however, the decimal point is\ngenerally dropped when spoken, making it \"twenty-two caliber\" or a \"two-two\ncaliber\". Calibers of firearms can be referred to in millimeters, as in a\n\"caliber of eighty-eight millimeters\" (88&nbsp;mm) or \"a hundred and five-\nmillimeter caliber gun\" (often abbreviated as \"105 mm gun\").\n\nWhile modern cartridges and cartridge firearms are generally referred to by the\ncartridge name, they are still lumped together based on bore diameter. For\nexample, a firearm might be described as a .30 caliber rifle, which could be any\nof a wide range of cartridges using a roughly .30&nbsp;inch projectile; or a\n\".22 rimfire\", referring to any rimfire cartridge using a .22 caliber\nprojectile.\n\nFirearm calibers outside the range of .17 to .50 (4.5 to 12.7&nbsp;mm) exist,\nbut are rarely encountered. Wildcat cartridges, for example, can be found in\n.10, .12, and .14 caliber (2.5, 3.0, & 3.6&nbsp;mm), typically used for short\nrange varmint hunting, where the high velocity, lightweight bullets provide\ndevastating terminal ballistics with little risk of ricochet. Larger calibers,\nsuch as .577, .585, .600, .700, and .729 (14.7, 14.9, 15.2, 17.8, &\n18.5&nbsp;mm) are generally found in proprietary cartridges chambered in express\nrifles or similar guns intended for use on dangerous game.<ref\nname=cotw10></ref> 950 JDJ is the only known cartridge beyond .79 caliber used\nin a rifle.\n\nIn some contexts, e.g. guns aboard a warship, \"caliber\" is used to describe the\nbarrel length as multiples of the bore diameter. A \"5-inch 50 calibre\" gun has a\nbore diameter of 5&nbsp;inches (12.7&nbsp;cm) and a barrel length of 50 times\n5&nbsp;inches = 250&nbsp;inches (6.35 m). In other words, it is used to describe\nthe approximate internal diameter of the barrel or of the projectile that is\nfired out of it.\n",
