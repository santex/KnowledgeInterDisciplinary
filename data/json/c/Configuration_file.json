{"cursor":"8987","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n being modified with gedit. This file contains a list of Operating Systems,\n which GNU GRUB reads and presents to the user as a menu.]]\n\nIn computing, 'configuration [[Computer file|file]]s', or 'config files'\nconfigure the initial settings for some computer programs. They are used for\nuser applications, server processes and operating system settings. The files are\noften written in ASCII (rarely UTF-8) and line-oriented, with lines terminated\nby a newline or carriage return/line feed pair, depending on the operating\nsystem. They may be considered a simple database.\n\nSome applications provide tools to create, modify, and verify the syntax of\ntheir configuration files; these sometimes have graphical interfaces. For other\nprograms, system administrators may be expected to create and modify files by\nhand using a text editor. For server processes and operating-system settings,\nthere is often no standard tool, but operating systems may provide their own\ngraphical interfaces such as YaST or debconf.\n\nSome computer programs only read their configuration files at startup. Others\nperiodically check the configuration files for changes. Users can instruct some\nprograms to re-read the configuration files and apply the changes to the current\nprocess, or indeed to read arbitrary files as a configuration file. There are no\ndefinitive standards or strong conventions.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Configuration_file","recorded":1362538688,"links":22,"instances":["software_package","api","computing","computing","programming_language","data_structure"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer data","Configuration files|"],"headings":["UNIX/Linux","Microsoft DOS","Microsoft Windows","IBM OS/2","Configuration languages","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Gnu_grub_config_file.png/400px-Gnu_grub_config_file.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["server","computing"],["debconf","software_package"],["shell","computing"],["list","data_structure"],["lua","programming_language"],["cocoa","api"]],"members":["debconf","cocoa","shell","server","lua","list"],"related":["Gedit","Operating_System","GNU_GRUB","Computing","Initial_settings","Computer_program","Application_software","Server_(computing)","Operating_system","ASCII","UTF-8","Newline","Carriage_return","Line_feed","Flat_file_database","Syntax","System_administrator","YaST","Debconf_(software_package)","Booting","Unix","Unix","Comment_out","Manpage","Unix","Full_stop","Dotfile","/etc","Shell_(computing)","Jargon_File","Run_commands","Compatible_Time-Sharing_System","Run_commands","Interpreted_language","Emacs","UNIX","Hidden_file","Windows_Explorer","Microsoft","Windows_XP","IBM","AIX_operating_system","Object_Data_Manager","CONFIG.SYS","AUTOEXEC.BAT","Microsoft_Windows","Windows_3.0","INI_file","Windows_Registry","OS/2","List_(data_structure)","Serialization","Turing_complete","Lua_(programming_language)","Markup_languages","XML","YAML","Open_source","Cross-platform","Specification","Parser","Emitter","INI_file",".properties","JSON","YAML","Plist","Cocoa_(API)"]}
