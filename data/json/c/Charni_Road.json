The main significance of Charni Road station is that it is\nnear the Girgaum Chowpatti beach and Marine Drive promenade, a major\ndestination for tourists in Mumbai. It is also important because of the diamond\ntrading industry located here, mainly in the Panchratna building near the\nrailway station.\n\nThe station derives its name from the fact that grazing lands for cattle and\nhorses were located nearby in earlier days (Charne in Marathi means to graze) In\n1838, the British rulers introduced a 'grazing fee' which several cattle-owners\ncould not afford. Therefore, Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy spent 20,000 from his own\npurse for purchasing some grasslands near the seafront at Thakurdwar and saw\nthat the starving cattle grazed without a fee in that area. In time the area\nbecame to be known as \"Charni\" meaning grazing. When a railway station on the\nBB&CI railway was constructed there it was called Charni Road. The BB&CI line\nfrom Back Bay to Virar opened in 1867.\n\n\nIn 1884, Sir Adamji Peerbhoy (1845â1913), a well known philanthropist from\nMumbai, India, built several properties (a Bohra kabrastan (cemetery/burial\nground)), masjid, Senatorium, and Amanbai Charitable Hospital later known as\nSaifee Hospital) on Charni Road opposite the railway station. He wanted to\nprovide a safe haven for the travellers, poor, or needy to rest, use the masjid\nfor prayers, or the hospital if they needed it. After Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy's\ndeath, his grandson Akbar, against the wishes of the family, converted the\nproperties into a trust. The family resisted the change, but Akbar had a lot of\ninfluence. He was the son of Abdul Hussein Peerbhoy (who was the second out of\nseven children of Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy, who had engineered and build the\nMatheran Railway) The property was out of the hands of the Peerbhoy family and\ninto the hands of the trustees. The trustees were later on changed by the Syedna\n(leader of the Dawoodi Bohras) and the new trustees handed over the property to\nthe Syedna. The property was built for the benefit of the poor and the needy.\nThe property still exist on Charni Road and is still under the name of Sir\nAdamji Peerbhoy. Hopefully the name of its original builder and its purpose is\npreserved and it continues to be used for the community and hospital for the\nbenefit and welfare of all people as charitable.\n\nToday Charni road is well known for its old charm Chawls, wholesale markets of\ndiamonds (Opera House), garments, Irani cafÃ©s traditional Maharashtrian culture\n(Girgaon) and also tall skyscrapers.\n","linknr":281,"url":"Charni_Road","recorded":1375077987,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charni_Road_railway_station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charni_Road_railway_station&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Charni_Road_railway_station","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Charni_Road&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charni_Road_railway_station&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT#SOAPBOX","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charni_Road_railway_station&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","/wiki/Wikipedia:EL","/wiki/Mumbai_Suburban_Railway","/wiki/File:Charni_Road_Station.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Charni_Road_Station.jpg/300px-Charni_Road_Station.jpg","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Charni_Road_railway_station&params=18.951565_N_72.818633_E_type:railwaystation_region:IN","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Charni_Road_railway_station&params=18.951565_N_72.818633_E_type:railwaystation_region:IN","/wiki/Western_Line_(Mumbai_Suburban_Railway)","/wiki/Ministry_of_Railways_(India)","/wiki/Indian_Railways","/wiki/Western_Railways","#cite_note-origins-1","/wiki/Railway_station","/wiki/Western_Line_(Mumbai_Suburban_Railway)","/wiki/Mumbai_Suburban_Railway","/wiki/Girgaum_Chowpatti","/wiki/Marine_Drive,_Mumbai","/wiki/Panchratna","/wiki/Marathi_language","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg/7px-Indian_Rupee_symbol.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Virar_railway_station","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Adamjee_Peerbhoy","/w/index.php?title=Matheran_Railway&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Syedna","/wiki/Dawoodi_Bohra","/w/index.php?title=Charni_road&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chawls","/wiki/Royal_Opera_House_(Mumbai)","/wiki/Irani_caf%C3%A9","/wiki/Girgaon","/w/index.php?title=Charni_Road_railway_station&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-origins_1-0","http://books.google.co.in/books?id=miD5YO05jpUC&dq=the+origins+of+bombay","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/81-206-0815-1","#cite_ref-2","http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xRsoAAAAMAAJ","/wiki/Marine_Lines_railway_station","/wiki/Mumbai_Suburban_Railway","/wiki/Western_Line_(Mumbai_Suburban_Railway)","/wiki/Grant_Road","/wiki/Template:Mumbai_-_Suburban_Railway,Western","/wiki/Template_talk:Mumbai_-_Suburban_Railway,Western","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Mumbai_-_Suburban_Railway,Western&action=edit","/wiki/Western_Line_(Mumbai_Suburban_Railway)","/wiki/Mumbai_Suburban_Railway","/wiki/Churchgate_railway_station","/wiki/Marine_Lines_railway_station","/wiki/Grant_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Mumbai_Central_railway_station","/wiki/Mahalaxmi_railway_station","/wiki/Lower_Parel_railway_station","/wiki/Elphinstone_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Dadar_railway_station","/wiki/Matunga_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Mahim_railway_station","/wiki/Bandra_railway_station","/wiki/Khar_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Santacruz_railway_station","/wiki/Vile_Parle_railway_station","/wiki/Andheri_railway_station","/wiki/Jogeshwari_railway_station","/wiki/Goregaon_railway_station","/wiki/Malad_railway_station","/wiki/Kandivali_railway_station","/wiki/Borivali_railway_station","/wiki/Dahisar_railway_station","/wiki/Mira_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Bhayandar_railway_station","/wiki/Naigaon_railway_station","/wiki/Vasai_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Nala_Sopara_railway_station","/wiki/Virar_railway_station","/wiki/Vaitarna_railway_station","/wiki/Saphale_railway_station","/wiki/Kelve_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Palghar_railway_station","/wiki/Umroli_railway_station","/wiki/Boisar_railway_station","/wiki/Vangaon_railway_station","/wiki/Dahanu_Road_railway_station","/wiki/Template:Mumbai_metropolitan_area","/wiki
