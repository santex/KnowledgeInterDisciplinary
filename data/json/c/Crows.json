Ranging in size\nfrom the relatively small pigeon-size jackdaws (Eurasian and Daurian) to the\nCommon Raven of the Holarctic region and Thick-billed Raven of the highlands of\nEthiopia, the 40 or so members of this genus occur on all temperate continents\nexcept for South America, and several islands. In Europe the word \"crow\" is used\nto refer to the Carrion Crow or the Hooded Crow, while in North America it is\nused for the American Crow or the Northwestern Crow.\n\nThe crow genus makes up a third of the species in the Corvidae family. Crows\nappear to have evolved in Asia from the corvid stock, which had evolved in\nAustralia. The collective name for a group of crows is a flock or a\nmurder.\n\nRecent research has found some crow species capable of not only tool use but\nalso tool construction and meta-tool use. Crows are\nnow considered to be among the world's most intelligent animals with an encephalization quotient approaching that of some\napes. The Jackdaw and the European Magpie have been found to have a nidopallium\napproximately the same relative size as the functionally equivalent neocortex in\nchimpanzees and humans, and significantly larger than is found in the\ngibbon.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Crows","recorded":1372152353,"links":[],"instances":["greek_mythology","australian_aboriginal_mythology","bird","mythology","conference","language","heraldry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Corvus|*","Talking birds","Scavengers"],"headings":["Description","Evolutionary history and systematics","Behavior","Diet","Life span and disease","Conservation status","As a food supplement","In human culture","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["latin","language"],["rook","bird"],["rook","bird"],["ted","conference"],["crow","australian_aboriginal_mythology"],["coronis","greek_mythology"],["arne","mythology"],["corvus","heraldry"]],"members":["coronis","crow","rook","arne","ted","latin","corvus"],"related":["American_Crow","Animal","Chordate","Bird","Passerine","Corvidae","Carolus_Linnaeus","Genus","Corvidae","Dove","Jackdaw","Eurasian_Jackdaw","Daurian_Jackdaw","Common_Raven","Holarctic","Thick-billed_Raven","Ethiopia","Continent","South_America","Carrion_Crow","Hooded_Crow","American_Crow","Northwestern_Crow","Corvidae","Collective_noun","Tool_use_by_animals","Animal_cognition","Encephalization_quotient","Jackdaw","European_Magpie","Nidopallium","Gibbon","Kumamoto,_Japan","Evolution","Asia","North_America","Africa","Europe","Australia","Jays","Magpies","Australasia","Asia","Carolus_Linnaeus","Latin_(language)","Type_species","Common_Raven","Carrion_Crow","Hooded_Crow","Rook_(bird)","Jackdaw","Magpie","Extant_taxon","Extinct","Fossil_record","Species","Avian_IQ","Jousting","Game_of_chicken","Episodic-like_memory","New_Caledonian_Crow","Tool","University_of_Oxford","England","Queensland","Australia","Cane_toad","West_Nile_virus","Extinct","Hawaiian_Crow","Mariana_Crow","American_Crow","West_Nile_Virus","Least_Concern","United_States_Fish_and_Wildlife_Service","Code_of_Federal_Regulations","Curonians","Kristijonas_Donelaitis","Curonian_Spit","Common_Raven","Carrion_Crow","Rook_(bird)","Brown-necked_Raven","TED_(conference)","Joshua_Klein","Vending_machine","Waste","Irish_mythology","Morrigan","Bran_the_Blessed","Tower_of_London","Cornish_folklore","Magpies","Augury","Pied","Norse_mythology","Huginn_and_Muninn","Common_Raven","Midgard","Odin","Australian_Aboriginal_mythology","Crow_(Australian_Aboriginal_mythology)","Trickster","Culture_hero","Chaldean_mythology","Utnapishtim","Dove","Greek_mythology","Apollo","Coronis_(Greek_mythology)","Hindu_cosmology","Kalpavriksha","Mount_Meru","Śrāddha","Buddhism","Mahakala","Japanese_mythology","Three-legged_crow","Korean_mythology","Three-legged_crow","Chinese_mythology","Houyi","Hinduism","Ovid","Arne_(mythology)","Minos","Aesop's_Fables","Pliny_the_Elder","Thessalian","Illyrians","Lemnian","Veneti","Corvus_(heraldry)","Eating_crow","Ischys","Scarecrow","Cracked.com"]}
