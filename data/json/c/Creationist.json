For the biological understanding of complexity, see [[Evolution of\ncomplexity]]. For a creationist perspective, see [[Irreducible\ncomplexity]]. Fundamentalist creationists of the Christian faith usually\nbase their belief on a literal reading of the Genesis creation narrative. Other religions have\ndifferent deity-led creation myths, while different members of\nindividual faiths vary in their acceptance of scientific findings.\n\nWhen scientific research produces empirical evidence and theoretical conclusions\nwhich contradict a literalist creationist interpretation of scripture, young\nearth creationists often reject the conclusions of the research or\nits underlying scientific theories or its methodology.\nThe rejection of scientific findings has sparked political and theological\ncontroversy. Two offshoots of\ncreationism—creation science and intelligent design—are\npseudoscience. The most notable disputes concern the evolution of\nliving organisms, the idea of common descent, the geological history of the\nEarth, the formation of the solar system and the origin of the\nuniverse.
