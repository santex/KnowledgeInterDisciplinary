Livingston, parodying the first-person shooter video game [[Half-\nLife 2]]. The comic consists of game screenshots, with characters posed using\n[[Garry's Mod]], a tool which facilitates manipulation of the Source engine used\nby Half-Life 2. The first issue was launched on May 1, 2005.<ref name=\"first\"/>\nThe comic completed its run on November 6, 2006 with a total of 205 issues.<ref\nname=\"last\"/>\n\nWhile Half-Life 2 takes the player through a dystopian future as protagonist\nGordon Freeman, Concerned follows a similar path through the eyes of Gordon\nFrohman, a hapless, lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in the setting of the game a\nfew weeks before Freeman. The comic's dark humor is derived from its contrasts\nwith the game, and through references to the game's shortcomings. On several\noccasions in the comic, Frohman becomes the cause of various disastrous\ncircumstances that Freeman will later encounter.\n\nConcerned has been well received by critics and fans alike. Several reviews\npraised the attention to writing and presentation,<ref name=\"Globe and\nMail\"></ref> as well as the comic's humor.<ref name=\"CGW\"></ref> Livingston has\nalso reported uniformly positive relations with personnel at Valve, the\ndeveloper company of Half-Life 2, who were pleased to have a comic based on\ntheir game.<ref name=\"Globe and Mail\" /><ref name=\"Irish Gamers\" />\n","title":"concerned","headings":["Background","Publication history","Synopsis","Themes","Reception","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Wallace_Breen","2: City_17","2: First-person_shooter","2: Dystopia","2: Gordon_Freeman","2: Valve_Corporation","2: Ravenholm","2: Headcrab","2: Alyx_Vance","1: Parody","1: Comedy","1: Webcomic","1: Video_game","1: Dark_humor","1: Nintendo_Entertainment_System","1: Garry's_Mod","1: Source_engine","1: Adobe_Photoshop","1: PHWOnline","1: SpinnWebe","1: Image_resolution","1: Episodic_games","1: Locations_in_the_Half-Life_series#Nova_Prospekt","1: Isaac_Kleiner","1: Gravity_gun","1: Father_Grigori","1: Free_will","1: Vortigaunt","1: One-liner_joke","1: Gautama_Buddha","1: Cheat_code","1: Ghost_town","1: Black_Mesa_Research_Facility","1: Romania"]}
