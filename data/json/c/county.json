Brookes (ed.),\n2005, Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh</ref> in certain modern nations.\nIts etymology derives from the Old French term, conté or cunté and could denote\na jurisdiction in mainland Europe, under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a\nviscount.<ref name=etymology>The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology, C. W.\nOnions (Ed.), 1966, Oxford University Press</ref> The modern French is comté,\nand its equivalents in other languages are contea, contado, comtat, condado,\nGrafschaft, Gau, etc.) (cf. [[Italian nobility|conte]], [[comte]], conde,\n[[Graf]]).\n\nWhen the Normans conquered England, they brought the term with them. The Saxons\nhad already established the regions that became the Historic counties of England\ncalling them shires<ref name=vision>Vision of Britain\n[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/type_page.jsp?unit_type=ANC_CNTY] —\nType details for ancient county. Retrieved 31 March 2012</ref> (many county\nnames derive from the name of the county town with the word \"shire\" added on:\nfor example, Gloucester, in Gloucestershire; Worcester, in Worcestershire).<ref-\n>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=county&searchmode=none Etymology of\nthe word county.]</ref> The Vikings introduced the term earl (from Old Norse,\njarl) to the British Isles. Thus, \"earl\" and \"earldom\" were taken as equivalent\nto the continental use of \"count\" and \"county\". So, the later-imported term\nbecame a synonym for the native English word scir () or, in Modern English,\nshire. Since a shire was an administrative division of the kingdom, the term\n\"county\" evolved to designate an administrative division of national government\nin most modern uses.\n\nA county may be further subdivided into hundreds, townships or other\nadministrative jurisdictions under the county's control. The boundaries of a\ncounty usually, but not always, contain cities, villages, towns, townships or\nother municipal corporations. Depending on the particular nation, municipalities\nmight or might not be subject to direct or indirect county control.\n\nOutside the Anglophone community of nations, the term \"county\" is often used to\ndescribe sub-national jurisdictions that are structurally equivalent to counties\nin the relationship they have with their national government; but which may or\nmay not be operationally equivalent to the county as that entity is known in\npredominantly English-speaking countries.\n",
