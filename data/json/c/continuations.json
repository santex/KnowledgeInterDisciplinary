A continuation\nreifies the program control state, i.e. the continuation is a data structure\nthat represents the computational process at a given point in the process'\nexecution; the created data structure can be accessed by the programming\nlanguage, instead of being hidden in the runtime environment. Continuations are\nuseful for encoding other control mechanisms in programming languages such as\nexceptions, generators, coroutines, and so on.\n\nThe \"'current continuation'\" or \"continuation of the computation step\" is the\ncontinuation that, from the perspective of running code, would be derived from\nthe current point in a program's execution. The term continuations can also be\nused to refer to 'first-class continuations', which are constructs that give a\nprogramming language the ability to save the execution state at any point and\nreturn to that point at a later point in the program.\n","title":"Continuation","headings":["History","First-class continuations","In Web development","Kinds","Disadvantages","Linguistics","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["7: Continuation-passing_style","6: Call-with-current-continuation","4: Coroutine","3: Exception_handling","3: Denotational_semantics","3: Smalltalk","3: Perl","2: Control_flow","2: Christopher_Strachey","2: Christopher_P._Wadsworth","2: John_C._Reynolds","2: Functional_programming","2: Lambda_calculus","2: Common_Lisp","2: Unlambda","2: Tail_recursion","2: Delimited_continuation","2: GOTO","2: RIFE","1: Computer_science","1: Computer_programming","1: Computer_program","1: Run-time_system","1: Programming_language","1: Adriaan_van_Wijngaarden","1: Algol_60","1: Steve_Russell","1: IBM_704","1: First-class_continuations","1: Standard_ML","1: Actor_model","1: Process_calculi","1: Programming_design_pattern","1: Green_thread","1: Setjmp","1: Simula","1: Stackless_Python","1: Backtracking","1: Prolog","1: Coroutines","1: Computer_multitasking#Cooperative_multitasking","1: Call_stack","1: Dynamic_memory_allocation","1: VB.NET","1: Haxe","1: Parrot_virtual_machine","1: Standard_ML_of_New_Jersey","1: Web_programming","1: Stateless_server","1: HTTP","1: Inversion_of_control","1: Web_server","1: Ocsigen","1: OCaml","1: C++","1: Apache_Cocoon","1: Web_application_framework","1: Peter_J._Landin","1: Setjmp/longjmp","1: Tail_call_elimination","1: Esoteric_programming_language","1: Montague_grammar","1: COMEFROM","1: Spaghetti_stack","1: Peter_Landin","1: Drew_McDermott","1: Gerry_Sussman","1: Daniel_Bobrow","1: Carl_Hewitt","1: Peter_Bishop","1: Richard_Steiger","1: Gerald_Sussman","1: Guy_Steele","1: Robert_Hieb","1: R._Kent_Dybvig","1: Carl_Bruggeman","1: Will_Clinger","1: Anne_Hartheimer","1: Eric_Ost","1: Association_for_Computing_Machinery","1: SIGPLAN","1: ICFP"]}
