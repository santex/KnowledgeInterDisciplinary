{"cursor":"8777","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nA 'lewis' is one of a category of lifting devices used by stonemasons to lift\nlarge stones into place with a crane, chain block, or winch. It is inserted into\na specially prepared hole, or seating, in the top of a stone, directly above its\ncentre of mass. It works by applying principles of the lever and utilises the\nweight of the stone to act on the long lever-arms which in turn results in a\nvery high reaction force and friction where the short lever-arms make contact\nwith the stone inside the hole and thereby prevents slipping.\n\nA lewis is most useful when it is not possible to lift the stone with chains or\nslings, because of either the location or shape of the stone, or delicate\nprojections. E.g., the closing stone in a string course; cylindrical column\ndrums; decorated column capitals; coping stones in a pediment. Heavy ashlar\nstones are also bedded using a lewis.\n\nThe name lewis may come from the Latin levo -avi, -atum meaning to\n[[levitation|levitate]] or just lift(www.perseus.tufts.edu), but the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary online says 'origin obscure'. The Romans used the lewis. The\nspecially shaped hole that is shaped to fit the device is known as a lewis hole.\nLewis holes in the uppermost masonry coursings are neatly repaired with matching\nindented plugs after the stone has been set in place.\n\n'[[Occupational safety and health|Safety]] caution': The lewis is liable to slip\nout of the seating if some of the weight of the stone is subtracted from the\nappliance, such as when the stone bumps on the scaffolding on its way up to its\nfinal location. For this reason, a safety sling should always be used together\nwith the lewis until the stone is reasonably close to its final position.\nLifting the stone a small distance from the ground before hoisting is the best\nway to test a lewis. Any sign of looseness or damage should be put right by\nadjusting the lewis hole or packing the lewis with metal shims.\n\n'Bedding a stone using a lewis': The stone is placed on dunnage laid flat with\nenough clearance for a mortar bed to be placed beneath it. The safety straps are\nremoved, the stone is lifted using the lewis alone, and the dunnage removed with\nfingers clear. The stone is then lowered onto the mortar bed, and positioned\nwith sharp taps from a rubber mallet.\n\nThere are a number of different types of lewis used in the stonemasonry trade:\n","linknr":217,"url":"Chain-linked_Lewis","recorded":1362476867,"links":32,"instances":["architecture","masonry","machine","architecture"],"pdf":["http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/gmd2007/vgmd26.pdf","http://www.ncl.ac.uk/historical/postgrad_forum/ed_1/ed_1_morgan.pdf"],"categories":["Stonemasonry tools","Cranes (machines)"],"headings":["Chain-linked lewis","Split-pin lewis","Two-pinned lewis","Three-legged lewis","External lewis","Gallery","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/CWO_%2816%29.jpg/240px-CWO_%2816%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Chain_Lewis.JPG/240px-Chain_Lewis.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Split_Pin_Lewis.JPG/240px-Split_Pin_Lewis.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Lewis_Hole_Indents.JPG/200px-Lewis_Hole_Indents.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/29/CWO_%283%29.JPG/200px-CWO_%283%29.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Louve_de_carrier.JPG/200px-Louve_de_carrier.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Wilson_bolt.jpg/111px-Wilson_bolt.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Wolf2.jpg/181px-Wolf2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ad/External_Lewis.jpg/144px-External_Lewis.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Slab_Lifter1.JPG/200px-Slab_Lifter1.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Lewis_slab_lifter.jpg/200px-Lewis_slab_lifter.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Lewis_slab_lifter_safety_lock.jpg/112px-Lewis_slab_lifter_safety_lock.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Maulbronn_-_Steinzange.jpg/200px-Maulbronn_-_Steinzange.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crane","machine"],["capital","architecture"],["coping","architecture"],["mortar","masonry"],["crane","machine"]],"members":["coping","mortar","crane","capital"],"related":["Stonemason","Crane_(machine)","Winch","Centre_of_mass","Lever","Friction","Link_chain","Corbel","Column","Capital_(architecture)","Coping_(architecture)","Pediment","Ashlar","Latin","Roman_Empire","Masonry","Scaffolding","Dunnage","Mortar_(masonry)","Mallet","Stonemasonry","Medieval","Tongs","Treadwheel","Crane_(machine)","Manual_kerb_lifter","Mechanical_kerb_lifter","Slab_lifter"]}
