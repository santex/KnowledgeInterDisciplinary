{"cursor":"14489","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Astronomical objects' or 'celestial objects' are naturally occurring physical\nentities, associations or structures that current science has demonstrated to\nexist in the observable universe. The term astronomical object is\nsometimes used interchangeably with astronomical body. Typically an astronomical\n(celestial) body refers to a single, cohesive structure that is bound together\nby gravity (and sometimes by electromagnetism). Examples include the asteroids,\nmoons, planets and the stars. Astronomical objects are gravitationally bound\nstructures that are associated with a position in space, but may consist of\nmultiple independent astronomical bodies or objects. These objects range from\nsingle planets to star clusters, nebulae or entire galaxies. A comet may be\ndescribed as a body, in reference to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust, or as\nan object, when describing the nucleus with its diffuse coma and tail.\n\nThe universe can be viewed as having a hierarchical structure. At the\nlargest scales, the fundamental component of assembly is the galaxy, which are\nassembled out of dwarf galaxies. The galaxies are organized into groups and\nclusters, often within larger superclusters, that are strung along great\nfilaments between nearly empty voids, forming a web that spans the observable\nuniverse. Galaxies and dwarf galaxies have a variety\nof morphologies, with the shapes determined by their formation and evolutionary\nhistories, including interaction with other galaxies. Depending on\nthe category, a galaxy may have one or more distinct features, such as spiral\narms, a halo and a nucleus. At the core, most galaxies have a supermassive black\nhole, which may result in an active galactic nucleus. Galaxies can also have\nsatellites in the form of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters.\n\nThe constituents of a galaxy are formed out of gaseous matter that assembles\nthrough gravitational self-attraction in a hierarchical manner. At this level,\nthe resulting fundamental components are the stars, which are typically\nassembled in clusters from the various condensing nebulae. The great\nvariety of stellar forms are determined almost entirely by the mass, composition\nand evolutionary state of these stars. Stars may be found in multi-star systems\nthat orbit about each other in a hierarchical organization. A planetary system\nand various minor objects such as asteroids, comets and debris, can form in a\nhierarchical process of accretion from the protoplanetary disks that surrounds\nnewly created stars.\n\nThe various distinctive types of stars are shown by the HertzsprungâRussell\ndiagram (H-R diagram) - a plot of absolute stellar luminosity versus surface\ntemperature. Each star follows an evolutionary track across this diagram. If\nthis track takes the star through a region containing an intrinsic variable\ntype, then its physical properties can cause it to become a variable star. An\nexample of this is the instability strip, a region of the H-R diagram that\nincludes Delta Scuti, RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables. {{cite book\n | first=Carl J. | last=Hansen | coauthors=Kawaler,
