{"cursor":"1929","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Cords of Billroth' (also known as 'splenic cords' or 'red pulp cords') are\nfound in the red pulp of the spleen between the sinusoids, consisting of fibrils\nand connective tissue cells with a large population of monocytes and\nmacrophages. These cords contain half of the human body's monocytes as a reserve\nso that after tissue injury these monocytes can move in and aid locally sourced\nmonocytes in wound healing.

PMID 19644120\n\nErythrocytes pass through the cords of Billroth before entering the sinusoids.\nThe passage into the sinusoids may be seen as a bottleneck, where erythrocytes\nneed to be flexible in order to pass through. In disorders of erythrocyte shape\nand/or flexibility, such as hereditary spherocytosis, erythrocytes fail to pass\nthrough and get phagocytosed, causing extravascular hemolysis.
