Scale bar: 5 µm; duration: 22\nseconds.]]\n\nIn mathematics, 'curvature' refers to any of a number of loosely related\nconcepts in different areas of geometry. Intuitively, curvature is the amount by\nwhich a geometric object deviates from being flat, or straight in the case of a\nline, but this is defined in different ways depending on the context. There is a\nkey distinction between 'extrinsic curvature', which is defined for objects\nembedded in another space (usually a Euclidean space) in a way that relates to\nthe radius of curvature of circles that touch the object, and [[Curvature of\nRiemannian manifolds|intrinsic curvature]], which is defined at each point in a\nRiemannian manifold. This article deals primarily with the first concept.\n\nThe canonical example of extrinsic curvature is that of a circle, which\neverywhere has curvature equal to the reciprocal of its radius. Smaller circles\nbend more sharply, and hence have higher curvature. The curvature of a smooth\ncurve is defined as the curvature of its osculating circle at each point.\n\nIn a plane, this is a scalar quantity, but in three or more dimensions it is\ndescribed by a curvature vector that takes into account the direction of the\nbend as well as its sharpness. The curvature of more complex objects (such as\nsurfaces or even curved n-dimensional spaces) is described by more complex\nobjects from linear algebra, such as the general Riemann curvature tensor.\n\nThe remainder of this article discusses, from a mathematical perspective, some\ngeometric examples of curvature: the curvature of a curve embedded in a plane\nand the curvature of a surface in Euclidean space.
