The name chalcogenide\noriginates from the Greek word \"chalcos\" meaning ore and \"gen\" meaning\nformation, thus the term chalcogenide is generally considered to mean ore\nformer. William B. Jensen, \"A note on the term chalcogen\", Journal of\nchemical education, 74:1063, 1997 These are three elements in Group 16 in\nthe periodic table: sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Such glasses are covalently\nbonded materials and may be classified as network solids; in effect, the entire\nglass matrix acts as an infinitely bonded molecule. Polonium is chemically a\nchalcogenide as well, it is not used in chalcogenide glasses because of its\nstrong radioactivity and high price.Oxygen is also a group 16 element however it\nis not considered a chalcogenide. Though oxide materials are the oldest known\nglass forming systems it has become more traditional to treat them separately\nfrom more recently discovered chalcogenide compounds. Scientifically oxide\nmaterials behave rather differently from other chalcogenides, in particular\ntheir widely different band gaps contribute to very dissimilar optical and\nelectrical properties. Chalcogenides can exist naturally as minerals; two of the\nmost well-known being FeS2 (pyrite) and AuTe2 (calaverite). In fact AuTe2 was\nthe chief reason for the name given to the gold-rush town 'Telluride' in\nSouthwest Colorado.\n\nThe classical chalcogenide glasses (mainly sulfur-based ones such as As-S or Ge-\nS) are strong glass-formers and possess glasses within large concentration\nregions. Glass forming abilities decrease with increasing molar weight of\nconstituent elements i.e. S>Se>Te. The semiconducting properties of chalcogenide\nglasses were revealed in 1955 by B.T. Kolomiets and N.A. Gorunova from Ioffe\nInstitute, USSR. This\ndiscovery initiated numerous researches and applications of this new class of\nsemiconducting materials.\n\nModern chalcogenide compounds like AgInSbTe and GeSbTe, widely used in\nrewritable optical disks and phase-change memory devices, are fragile glass-\nformers; by applying heat, they can be switched between an amorphous (glassy)\nand a crystalline state, thereby changing their optical and electrical\nproperties and allowing the storage of information.\n","linknr":272,"url":"Chalcogenide_glass","recorded":1362481733,"links":16,"instances":["optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Non-oxide glasses","Optical materials","Chalcogenides"],"headings":["Chemistry","Applications","References","External links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/CD-RW_bottom.jpg/220px-CD-RW_bottom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","optics"]],"members":["lens"],"related":["Glass","Chalcogen","Chemical_element","Oxygen","Periodic_table","Sulfur","Selenium","Tellurium","Covalently","Network_solid","Molecule","Polonium","Radioactivity","Oxygen","Pyrite","Calaverite","Arsenic_trisulfide","Germanium_monosulfide","Semiconductor","Ioffe_Institute","AgInSbTe","GeSbTe","Optical_disc","Phase-change_memory","Amorphous","Crystalline","Silica","Gallium_lanthanum_sulphide","Lens_(optics)","Optical_fiber","Infrared","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Phonon","Lasers","Rare-earth_element","Non-volatile","Phase-change_memory","Phase_transition","GeSbTe","AgInSbTe","Zinc_sulfide","Silicon_dioxide","InSe","SbSe","SbTe","InSbSe","InSbTe","GeSbSe","GeSbTeSe","AgInSbSeTe","ECD_Ovonics","GeSbTe","AgInSbTe","Silver_selenide","Germanium_selenide"]}
