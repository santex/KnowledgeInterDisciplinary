Dodge, Y. (2003) The\nOxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP. ISBN 0-19-920613-9 A measure\nof central tendency is any of a number of ways of specifying this \"central\nvalue\". In practical statistical analysis, the terms are often used before one\nhas chosen even a preliminary form of analysis: thus an initial objective might\nbe to \"choose an appropriate measure of central tendency\".\n\nIn the simplest cases, the measure of central tendency is an average of a set of\nmeasurements, the word average being variously construed as mean, median, or\nother measure of location, depending on the context. However, the term is\napplied to multidimensional data as well as to univariate data and in situations\nwhere a transformation of the data values for some or all dimensions would\nusually be considered necessary: in the latter cases, the notion of a \"central\nlocation\" is retained in converting an \"average\" computed for the transformed\ndata back to the original units. In addition, there are several different kinds\nof calculations for central tendency, where the kind of calculation depends on\nthe type of data (level of measurement).\n\nBoth \"central tendency\" and \"measure of central tendency\" apply to either\nstatistical populations or to samples from a population.\n","linknr":326,"url":"Central_tendency","recorded":1362675244,"links":21,"instances":["statistics","statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Summary statistics","Multivariate statistics","Statistical terminology"],"headings":["Measures of central tendency","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["data_transformation","statistics"],["mode","statistics"]],"members":["data_transformation","mode"],"related":["Statistics","Quantitative_data","Average","Measurement","Univariate","Data_transformation_(statistics)","Level_of_measurement","Statistical_population","Arithmetic_mean","Median","Mode_(statistics)","Geometric_mean","Nth_root","Harmonic_mean","Multiplicative_inverse","Weighted_mean","Truncated_mean","Midrange","Midhinge","Quartile","Trimean","Winsorized_mean","Geometric_median","Location_parameter","Central_limit_theorem"]}
