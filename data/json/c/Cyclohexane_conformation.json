{"cursor":"17647","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'cyclohexane conformation' is any of several three-dimensional shapes that a\ncyclohexane molecule can assume while maintaining the integrity of its\nchemical bonds.\n\nThe internal angles of a flat regular hexagon are 120Â°, while the preferred\nangle between successive bonds in a carbon chain is about 109Â°, the tetrahedral\nangle. Therefore the cyclohexane ring tends to assume certain non-planar\n(warped) conformations, which have all angles closer to 109Â° and therefore a\nlower strain energy than the flat hexagonal shape. The most important shapes are\ncalled 'chair', 'half-chair', 'boat', and 'twist-boat'. The molecule can easily switch between these\nconformations, and only two of them â chair and twist-boat â can be isolated in\npure form.\n\nCyclohexane conformations have been extensively studied in organic chemistry\nbecause they are the classical example of conformational isomerism and have\nnoticeable influence on the physical and chemical properties of cyclohexane.\n","linknr":327,"url":"Cyclohexane_conformation","recorded":1362890002,"links":24,"instances":["chemist","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stereochemistry"],"headings":["Historical background","General","Chair conformation","Boat conformation","Twist-boat conformation","Half-chair conformation","Interconversions between conformations","Forced conformations","Cyclohexane derivatives","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Cyclohexane-chair-colour-coded-3D-balls.png/250px-Cyclohexane-chair-colour-coded-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/CC6H12-confs2.png/344px-CC6H12-confs2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Cyclohexane_universe.png/300px-Cyclohexane_universe.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ernst_mohr","chemist"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["ernst_mohr","mole"],"related":["Cyclohexane","Molecule","Chemical_bond","Internal_angle","Regular_polygon","Hexagon","Molecular_geometry","Carbon","Tetrahedral_angle","Strain_energy","Organic_chemistry","Conformational_isomerism","Hermann_Sachse","Ernst_Mohr_(chemist)","Diamond","Derek_Barton","Odd_Hassel","Nobel_Prize","Orbital_hybridisation","Tetrahedron","Tetravalent","Molecular_geometry","Polygon","Angle_strain","Local_minimum","Staggered","Torsional_strain","Halogen","Functional_group","Methylcyclohexane","Methyl_group","Gauche_butane_interaction","Cis-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane","Heterocycles","Pyran","Anomeric_effect","Gibbs_free_energy","Deuterium","Tert-butyl","Molecular_symmetry","Plane_of_symmetry","Molecular_symmetry","Flagpole_interaction","Steric_strain","Eclipsed","Molecular_symmetry","Kelvin","Molecular_symmetry","Dihedral_angles","Chemical_equilibrium","Maxima_and_minima","Maxima_and_minima","Ground_state","J._Org._Chem.","Calorie","Mole_(unit)","Kilojoule","Transition_state","Molecular_symmetry","Reaction_coordinate","Twistane","Cis_isomer","Methylene_bridge","Sulfide","Tert-butyl","NMR_spectroscopy","University_of_Nijmegen","Michigan_State_University"]}
