style=\"text-align: left;\" | It is no great wonder if in long process of time,\n| while fortune takes her course hither and thither, numerous coincidences\n| should spontaneously occur.\n\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | —Plutarch. [[Plutarch's Lives]]: Vol. II.\n| \"Sertorius\" }\nA 'coincidence' (often stated as a 'merecoincidence') is a collection of two or\nmore events or conditions, closely related by time, space, form, or other\nassociations which appear unlikely to bear a relationship as either cause to\neffect or effects of a shared cause, within the observer's or observers'\nunderstanding of what cause can produce what effects.\n\nThe word is derived from the Latin cum- (\"with\", \"together\") and incidere (a\ncomposed verb from \"in\" and \"cadere\": \"to fall on\", \"to happen\"). In science,\nthe term is generally used in a more literal translation, e.g., referring to\nwhen two rays of light strike a surface at the same point at the same time. In\nthis usage of coincidence, there is no implication that the alignment of events\nis surprising, noteworthy or non-causal.\n\nFrom a statistical perspective, coincidences are inevitable and often less\nremarkable than they may appear intuitively. An example is the birthday problem,\nwhere the probability of two individuals sharing a birthday already exceeds 50%\nwith a group of only 23.<ref></ref> {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right;\nmargin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7;\ncolor:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | A \"strange coincidence\", to use a phrase<br>By\n| which such things are settled nowadays. - style=\"text-align: left;\" | —Lord\n| Byron.
