The publication offers mainstream readers insight into the latest trends\nin niche cultures, such as streetwear, sneaker culture, hip hop, and graphic\nart. Complex has a stated monthly circulation of approximately 300,000 and\ntargets men that are college-aged to early 30s in urban/metropolitan\nareas.\n\nOne of the magazine's unique attributes is that each issue features a different\ncover on each side (one male, one female), creating two distinct sections. The\nhalf of the magazine that follows the male celebrity cover (e.g., Kanye West,\nSeth Rogen, Pharrell, Kobe Bryant, James Franco) is geared toward lifestyles,\nthe latest films, music, and other forms of media. The half of the magazine that\nfollows the female celebrity cover (e.g., Jessica Alba, M.I.A., Cassie, Rosario\nDawson, Olivia Munn, Gwen Stefani, Mila Kunis) is dubbed \"The Guide\" and offers\na [[Consumer Reports]]-esque breakdown of the latest consumer items, technology,\nsneakers, and apparel. It is known as \"The Original Buyer's Guide for Men\"\nbecause it was the first magazine in the men's market to emulate the shopping\nguide formula of [[Lucky (magazine)|Lucky]] and the Japanese magazines on which\nthat magazine was modeled.\n\nTwo years after its launch, big publishing houses like CondÃ© Nast Publications\nattempted similar titles, like Cargo, Sync, and VITALS, all of which folded\nwithin two years of launch.\n\nIn 2007, the Complex Media Network was launched, bringing several sites around\nthe web under the Complex umbrella. These include\nJuxtapoz.com, Nahright.com, HipHopDX.com, NiceKicks.com, 2Dopeboyz.com,\nConsequence of Sound, DJBooth.com, YouHeardThatNew.com, MaskedGorilla.com and\nmany others. The sites of the Complex Media Network generate upwards of 50\nmillion unique visitors per month. In 2009, Complex Media\nspun off from Mark Ecko Enterprises to become an independent company.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Complex_(magazine)","recorded":1362372536,"links":13,"instances":["artist","sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American music magazines","Fashion magazines","Hip hop magazines","American men's magazines","Monthly magazines","Magazines established in 2002"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Complex_%28magazine%29_November_2007_cover.jpg/220px-Complex_%28magazine%29_November_2007_cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lifestyle","sociology"],["m.i.a.","artist"]],"members":["lifestyle"],"related":["English_language","Lifestyle_(sociology)","United_States","Marc_Ecko","Kanye_West","Seth_Rogen","Pharrell","Kobe_Bryant","James_Franco","Jessica_Alba","M.I.A._(artist)","Cassie_Ventura","Rosario_Dawson","Olivia_Munn","Gwen_Stefani","Mila_Kunis","Condé_Nast_Publications","Consequence_of_Sound"]}
