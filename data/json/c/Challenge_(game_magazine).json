{"cursor":"1461","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Challenge' was a role-playing game magazine published by Game Designers'\nWorkshop between 1986 and 1996. Announced in [[Journal of the Travellers Aid\nSociety]] No. 22, the new (at the time unnamed) magazine was going to expand\nJTAS to a larger format (8.5\"Ã11\") and add coverage of GDW's new game [[Twilight\n2000]] and other games. The larger size would allow printing of things such as\ndeck plans or sector maps which would not fit in the smaller JTAS format.\n\nIn order to maintain continuity for the [[Traveller (rpg)|Traveller]] fans (and\nJTAS subscribers) the first issue was numbered 25, rather than starting again\nwith issue 1. Also to maintain continuity, Challenge featured a separate section\nlabeled \"Journal of the Travellers' Aid\", which lasted through issue 28.\nTraveller articles continued to appear in Challenge, but issues were frequently\ndominated by articles of other gaming systems, including [[Twilight 2000]],\n[[2300 AD]], [[Space 1889]], and starting with the expansion to 64 pages in\nissue 30, games not published by GDW.\n\nFifty-three issues of Challenge were published (through number 77), until 1996\nwhen the closing of GDW forced the end of publication.\n","linknr":77,"url":"Challenge_(game_magazine)","recorded":1362569632,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Role-playing game magazines","Traveller"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Role-playing_game","Game_Designers'_Workshop"]}
