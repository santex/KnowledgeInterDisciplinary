The first minister (1899â1907) was the Reverend William Todd,\nrenowned for his fervent evangelical preaching. Originally built for the Free\nChurch of Scotland, the church buildings were completed in 1901. By this time\nthe congregation had become part of the United Free Church of Scotland, which in\nturn united with the Church of Scotland in 1929, thus reuniting Scotlandâs\nlargest Presbyterian denominations.\n\nIn 2004 the congregation had 820 members, making Crown Church the largest Church\nof Scotland congregation in Inverness in terms of membership. The current\nminister (since 1998) is the Reverend Dr Peter H. Donald, who is also Vice-\nConvener of the Church of Scotlandâs Mission and Discipleship Council.\n\nThe Sunday morning services also include a various assortment of musical\naccompaniment. The church choir makes regular appearances, conducted by the\norganist Brigid Donald and accompanied by Ross Fairfield.\n\nThe Crown Church Youth Band is also welcomed during church services. Consisting\nof flute, clarinet, saxophone, vocals and piano, the band provide accompaniment\nwith the singing of hymns and share their various arrangements which match up\nwith the theme of the service. The band have delighted us with \"Jubilation\nCelebration\", a jazzy piece that was loved by all. Other arrangements include\n\"Everybody, Everywhere\", \"At this Table\" (for communion) \"Calypso Carol\" and\n\"How Quietly\" (both of which for Christmas) and \"Lord of the Dance\" and \"What\nHave They Done?\" (both of which for Easter). The band is led and accompanied by\nRoss Fairfield.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Crown_Church,_Inverness","recorded":1375066461,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Inverness_-_Crown_Church_(Church_of_Scotland)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3076854.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Inverness_-_Crown_Church_%28Church_of_Scotland%29_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3076854.jpg/250px-Inverness_-_Crown_Church_%28Church_of_Scotland%29_-_geograph.org.uk_-_3076854.jpg","/wiki/Christian_denomination","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Churchmanship","/wiki/Reformed","http://www.crown-church.co.uk","/wiki/Presbyterian_polity","/w/index.php?title=Presbytery_of_Inverness&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Minister_(Christianity)","/wiki/Organist","/wiki/Inverness","/wiki/Scottish_Highlands","/wiki/Free_Church_of_Scotland_(1843-1900)","/wiki/United_Free_Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Presbyterian","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Inverness","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=edit&section=2","http://www.crown-church.co.uk/","http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/","http://www.invernesspresbytery.co.uk/","http://www.stevebulman.f9.co.uk/churches/images/high/inverness/crown.jpg","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Crown_Church,_Inverness&params=57.47733_N_4.21822_W_type:landmark_region:GB","/wiki/File:Scotstmargretschapel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Scotstmargretschapel.jpg/25px-Scotstmargretschapel.jpg","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Scotland-church-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Scotland-church-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scotland-church-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&oldid=545878198","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland_churches_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Churches_in_Inverness","/wiki/Category:Scottish_church_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Crown+Church%2C+Inverness&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Crown+Church%2C+Inverness","/wiki/Crown_Church,_Inverness","/wiki/Talk:Crown_Church,_Inverness","#","/wiki/Crown_Church,_Inverness","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Crown_Church,_Inverness","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Crown_Church,_Inverness","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&oldid=545878198","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5189324","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Crown_Church%2C_Inverness&id=545878198","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Crown+Church%2C+Inverness","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Crown+Church%2C+Inverness&oldid=545878198&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Crown_Church,_Inverness&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5189324#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.
