The\nage at which this transition takes place varies in society, as does the nature\nof the transition. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/books/20newly.html New\nYork Times] It can be a simple legal convention or can be part of a\nritual, as practiced by many societies. In the past, and in some societies\ntoday, such a change is associated with the age of sexual maturity (early\nadolescence); in others, it is associated with an age of religious\nresponsibility. Particularly in western societies, modern legal conventions\nwhich stipulate points in late adolescence or early adulthood (most commonly 16-\n21 when adolescents are generally no longer considered minors and are granted\nthe full rights of an adult) are the focus of the transition. In either case,\nmany cultures retain ceremonies to confirm the coming of age, and significant\nbenefits come with the change. (See also rite of passage.)\n\nComing of age is often a topic of fiction. In literature, a novel which deals\nwith coming of age is called a [[bildungsroman]]. Similar stories told in film\nare called coming-of-age films.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Coming_of_age","recorded":1362486299,"links":21,"instances":["mythology","beer","law","unitarian_universalism","cameroon_and_gabon","wine","ancient_rome","birthday","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rites of passage"],"headings":["Religious","Cultural","Professional initiatory rituals","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["minor","law"],["mars","mythology#mars_ultor"],["diana","mythology"],["venus","mythology"],["patrician","ancient_rome"],["champagne","wine"],["yard","beer"],["sweet_sixteen","birthday"],["baka","cameroon_and_gabon"],["coming_of_age","unitarian_universalism"],["sweet_sixteen","birthday"]],"members":["diana","yard","minor","coming_of_age","baka","champagne","patrician","sweet_sixteen","mars","venus"],"related":["Childhood","Adult","Ritual","Sexual_maturity","Minor_(law)","Ceremony","Rite_of_passage","Coming-of-age_film","Baha'i_laws","Theravada","Shinbyu","Initiated","Samanera","Vassa","Celibacy","Poverty","Nonviolence","Fasting","Pali","Suttas","Gathas","Vinaya","Bhavana","Dhyāna_in_Buddhism","Samadhi","Prajna","Brahmavihara","Bhikkhu","Theravada","Samanera","Samanera","Thai_language","Khmer_language","Baptist","Sacrament","Confirmation","Eastern_Orthodoxy","Baptism","Bishop","Holy_Spirit","Believer's_Baptism","Catechism","Sparta","Crete","Mentoring","Hunting","Martial_arts","Lares","Persius","Roman_citizenship","Roman_census","Augustus","Forum_Augustum","Liberalia","Liber","Propertius","Ovid","Diana_(mythology)","Venus_(mythology)","Persius","Scholion","Marriage_in_ancient_Rome","Prostitution_in_ancient_Rome","Martial","Social_class_in_ancient_Rome","Betrothal","Patrician_(ancient_Rome)","Julius_Caesar","Hercules_knot","Sextus_Pompeius_Festus","Hercules_in_ancient_Rome","Verrius_Flaccus","Upanayana","Ritushuddhi","Yoruba_religion","Yoruba_people","West_Africa","Initiation","Almighty_God","Ifá","Meditation","Reincarnation","Spirit_possession","Salah","Shia_Islam","Sunni_Islam","Genpuku","Sikhism","Na'ii'ees","Australia","New_Zealand","United_Kingdom","Republic_of_Ireland","Ukraine","Republic_of_Poland","Champagne_(wine)","Yard_(beer)","Confucian","Guan_Li","Ji_Li","Style_name","China","Hanfu_Movement","Humanism","Freethought","Quinceañera","Débutante","United_States","Canada","Sweet_Sixteen_(birthday)","Conscription","Rural_exodus","Age_of_majority","Japan","Initiation","Baka_(Cameroon_and_Gabon)","Pygmies","Anthropology","Goryeo","Gat","Binyeo","Hanbok","White_coat_ceremony","University_of_St_Andrews","Scotland","Offal","Adolescence","Bildungsroman","Coming_of_Age_(Unitarian_Universalism)","Coming-of-age_film","Journey_of_self-discovery","Loss_of_innocence","Manhood","Quinceañera","Rite_of_passage","Sweet_sixteen_(birthday)"]}
