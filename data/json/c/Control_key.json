{"cursor":"13334","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn computing, a 'Control key' is a modifier key which, when pressed in\nconjunction with another key, will perform a special operation (for example,\n{{keypress); similar to the Shift key, the Control key rarely performs any\nfunction when pressed by itself. The Control key is located on or near the\nbottom left side of most keyboards (in accordance with the international\nstandard ISO/IEC 9995-2), with many featuring an additional one at the\nbottom right.\n\nIt is usually labeled (rarely, or is seen) on keyboards which use English\nabbreviations for key labeling. Abbreviations in the language of the keyboard\nlayout also are in use. e.g. the German layout uses as required by the German\nstandard DIN 2137:2012-06. Also, there is a standardized keyboard symbol (to be\nused when Latin lettering is not preferred), given in ISO/IEC 9995-7 as symbol\n26, and in ISO 7000 âGraphical symbols for use on equipmentâ as symbol ISO-7000-\n2028. This symbol is encoded in Unicode as U+2388 (â).\n","linknr":434,"url":"Control_key","recorded":1362477619,"links":34,"instances":["macintosh","computing","software","computing","text_editor","programming_language","electricity","posix","gui","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer keys"],"headings":["History","Notation","Examples","Similar concepts","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Ctl_wndws_alt.jpg/220px-Ctl_wndws_alt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/ISOIEC-9995-7-026--ISO-7000-2028--Symbol-for-Control.svg/130px-ISOIEC-9995-7-026--ISO-7000-2028--Symbol-for-Control.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg/450px-KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["keyboard","computing"],["ground","electricity"],["vim","text_editor"],["sigint","posix"],["lisp","programming_language"],["window","computing"],["icon","computing"],["window","computing"],["window","computing"],["window","computing"],["tab","gui"],["tab","gui"],["window","computing"],["tab","gui"],["window","computing"],["tab","gui"],["control_key","macintosh"],["clipboard","software"]],"members":["control_key","icon","clipboard","window","vim","lisp","ground","sigint","tab","keyboard"],"related":["Computing","Modifier_key","Control-C","Shift_key","ISO/IEC_9995","DIN","ISO/IEC_9995","Unicode","Teletypewriter","Keyboard_(computing)","Bit","ASCII","Display_device","Ground_(electricity)","Software","Computer_terminal","Teletype_Model_33","Lear-Siegler","ADM-3A","IBM_PC","Workstation","Unix","Sun_Microsystems","One_Laptop_Per_Child","Happy_Hacking_Keyboard","Caret","Emacs","Vim_(text_editor)","Microsoft","OpenVMS","Mac_OS","Mac_OS_X","Microsoft_Windows","KDE","GNOME","Unix","Command_line","Readline","Emacs","Control-C","Cut,_copy,_and_paste","SIGINT_(POSIX)","Web_browser","Command_line_completion","Tab_key","Newline","Lisp_(programming_language)","Cut,_copy,_and_paste","Enter_key","Window_(computing)","Software_flow_control","Software_flow_control","Control-V","Cut,_copy,_and_paste","Cut,_copy,_and_paste","Control-X","Cut,_copy,_and_paste","Control-Y","Cut_and_paste","Control-Z","Undo","Icon_(computing)","Window_(computing)","Control-Z","Esc_key","Alt_key","Esc_key","Alt_key","Esc_key","Alt_key","Esc_key","Alt_key","Window_(computing)","Window_(computing)","Copy_and_paste","Copy_and_paste","Tab_(GUI)","Tab_(GUI)","Window_(computing)","Tab_(GUI)","Window_(computing)","Tab_(GUI)","X11","Control-Alt-Delete","Command_key","Apple_Macintosh","Mac_OS_X","Mac_OS","Macintosh","Control_key_(Macintosh)","Contextual_menu","Modifier_key","Contextual_menu","Command_line_interface","Mac_OS_X","Emacs","Kill_ring","Clipboard_(software)","Alt_key","Break_key","Control_characters","Control-Alt-Delete","Function_key","Keyboard_layout","Modifier_key"]}
