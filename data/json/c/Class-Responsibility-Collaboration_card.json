They were proposed by Ward\nCunningham and Kent Beck. {{Citation\n  | last1 = Beck | first1 = Kent author1-link = Kent Beck last2 = Cunningham |\n  | first2 = Ward author2-link = Ward Cunningham title = A laboratory for\n  | teaching object oriented thinking journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices volume = 24\n  | issue = 10 pages = 1â6 publisher = Abg\n\n  | location = india, NY, USA date = feb 2012 year = 2012 isbn = 0-89791-333-7\n  | doi = 10.1145/74878.74879 }}\nThey are typically used when first determining which classes are needed and how\nthey will interact.\n\nCRC cards are usually created from index cards on which there are written:\n\n# The class name Its Super and Sub classes (if applicable) The responsibilities\n# of the class. The names of other classes with which the class will collaborate\n# to fulfill its responsibilities. Author\n\nUsing a small card keeps the complexity of the design at a minimum. It focuses\nthe designer on the essentials of the class and prevents her/him from getting\ninto its details and inner workings at a time when such detail is probably counter-\nproductive. It also forces the designer to refrain from giving the class too\nmany responsibilities. Because the cards are portable, they can easily be laid\nout on a table and re-arranged while discussing a design with other people.\n\nA common method to determine what cards should be created is to read a\nspecification for the program being designed and consider if each noun should\nbe a class and if each verb should be a responsibility of the noun or class\nto which it belongs. Naturally, the existence of a noun or verb does not\nrequire a class or responsibility in the program, but it is considered a good\nstarting point.\n","linknr":108,"url":"Class-Responsibility-Collaboration_card","recorded":1362665289,"links":17,"instances":["computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Extreme programming","Software design"],"headings":["Template","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["class","computer_science"]],"members":["class"],"related":["Brainstorming","Object-oriented","Software","Ward_Cunningham","Kent_Beck","Class_(computer_science)","Index_card","Implementation","Object-oriented_design","Meta-modeling","Unified_Modeling_Language"]}
