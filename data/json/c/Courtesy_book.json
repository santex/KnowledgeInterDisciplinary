{"cursor":"1857","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'Courtesy book' or 'Book of Manners' was a book dealing with issues of\netiquette, behaviour and morals, with a particular focus on the life at princely\ncourts. 'Courtesy literature' can be traced back to 13th Century German and\nItalian writers. {{citation |contribution=courtesy literature\n|title=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online |year=2008 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/140802/courtesy-\nliterature}}.\n\nIn England the vogue for such literature derived primarily from Elizabethan\ntranslations of three sixteenth-century Italian texts on courtly manners and\nmorals: Baldassarre Castiglioneâs [[Il Cortegiano]] (1528), Giovanni della\nCasaâs Il Galateo (1558) and Stefano Guazzoâs [[La Civil Conversazione]] (1574).\nThomas Hoby published The Courtyer, his version of Il Cortegiano, in 1561\n(although he had made the translation a decade earlier). The work was read\nwidely and influenced the writings of Shakespeare, Spenser and Ben Jonson.\nRobert Petersonâs translation of Il Galateo appeared in 1576. George Pettie\npublished The Civil Conversation, his translation of the first three books of\nGuazzoâs text, in 1581; the fourth and final book appeared five years later in a\ntranslation by Bartholomew Yonge. A well-known English example of the genre is\nHenry Peachamâs The Compleat Gentleman of 1622.
