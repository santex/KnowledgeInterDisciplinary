{"cursor":"2635","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Coulomb barrier', named after Coulomb's law, which is named after physicist\nCharles-Augustin de Coulomb (1736â1806), is the energy barrier due to\nelectrostatic interaction that two nuclei need to overcome so they can get close\nenough to undergo a nuclear reaction. This energy barrier is given by the\nelectrostatic potential energy:\n\n: U_{coul} = k {{q_1 \\, q_2} \\over r}\nwhere :k is the Coulomb's constant = 8.9876Ã10 9 N mÂ² C â2 ;\n:Îµ 0 is the permittivity of free space;\n:q 1, q 2 are the charges of the interacting particles; :r\nis the interaction radius.\n\nA positive value of U is due to a repulsive force, so interacting particles are\nat higher energy levels as they get closer. A negative potential energy\nindicates a bound state (due to an attractive force).\n\nCoulomb's barrier increases with the atomic numbers (i.e. the number of protons)\nof the colliding nuclei:\n: U_{coul}={{k \\, Z_1 \\, Z_2 \\, e^2} \\over r}\nwhere e is the elementary charge, 1.602 176 53Ã10 â19 C, and\nZ i the corresponding atomic numbers.\n\nTo overcome this barrier, nuclei have to collide at high velocities, so their\nkinetic energies drive them close enough for the strong interaction to take\nplace and bind them together.\n\nAccording to the kinetic theory of gases, the temperature of a gas is just a\nmeasure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in that gas. For normal\ngases, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the fraction of particles moving\nat a given velocity as a function of gas temperature, and thus the fraction of\nparticles moving at velocities high enough to overcome the Coulomb's barrier can\nbe derived.\n\nIn practice, temperatures needed to overcome Coulomb's barrier turn out to be\nsmaller than expected due to quantum-mechanical tunneling, as established by\nGamow. The consideration of barrier-penetration through tunneling and the speed\ndistribution gives rise to a limited range of conditions where the fusion can\ntake place, known as the Gamow window.\n\nIt was the absence of a Coulomb barrier for the neutron that enabled James\nChadwick to discover it.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Coulomb_barrier","recorded":1362512644,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear physics","Nuclear fusion","Nuclear chemistry"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/6/fc6d3c51b5d5ef7fa6a505ab180f34e6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/5/045ef6a8639476dcb04c5860a8591360.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Coulomb's_law","Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb","Electrostatic","Nuclear_reaction","Electrostatic_potential_energy","Coulomb","Vacuum_permittivity","Atomic_number","Elementary_charge","Strong_interaction","Kinetic_theory_of_gases","Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution","Quantum_tunnelling","George_Gamow","Gamow_window","James_Chadwick","Quantum_tunnelling"]}
