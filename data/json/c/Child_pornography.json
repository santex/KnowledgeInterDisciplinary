{"cursor":"53519","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Child pornography' refers to pornography depicting sexually explicit activities\ninvolving a child. It may use a\nvariety of media, http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids-\n/servlet/PageServlet?PageId=1504 including writings, magazines, photos, sculpture, drawing, cartoon, painting, animation, sound recording, film,\nvideo, and video games. [http://digiknow.ninemsn.com/gaming/gamesfeatures/8255964/child-\nporn-video-game-rated-pg-in-australia \"Child Porn\" video game rated PG in\nAustralia] Child pornography is divided into simulated child pornography\nand pornography which was produced with direct involvement of the child (also\nknown as 'child abuse images' ). Abuse of the child occurs during\nthe sexual acts which are recorded in the production of child pornography.\n\nNinety-four of 187 Interpol member states had laws specifically addressing child\npornography as of 2008, though this does not include nations that ban all\npornography. Of those 94 countries, 58 criminalized possession\nof child pornography regardless of intent to distribute. Both\ndistribution and possession are now criminal offenses in almost all Western\ncountries. A wide movement is working to globalize the criminalization of child\npornography, including major international organisations such as the United\nNations and the European Commission. [http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/index.htm World Congress\nagainst Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children]\n\nLegal definitions of child pornography generally include sexual images involving\nprepubescents and pubescent or post-pubescent minors and computer-generated\nimages that appear to involve them. Most possessors of child\npornography who are arrested are found to possess images of prepubescent\nchildren; possessors of pornographic images of post-pubescent minors are less\nlikely to be prosecuted, even though those images also fall within the\nstatutes.\n\nProducers of child pornography try to avoid prosecution by distributing their\nmaterial across national borders, though this issue is increasingly being\naddressed with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries occurring\nover the last few years. The prepubescent\npornography is viewed and collected by pedophiles for a variety of purposes,\nranging from private sexual uses, trading with other pedophiles, preparing\nchildren for sexual abuse as part of the process known as \"child grooming\", or\nenticement leading to entrapment for sexual exploitation such as production of\nnew child pornography or child prostitution. Child pornography is illegal\nand censored in most jurisdictions in the world.
