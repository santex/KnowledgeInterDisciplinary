It is\ntypically purchased by parties separate from a farm. The term cash\ncrop is applied exclusively to the agricultural production of plants; animal\nagriculture is not a part of the terminology. The term is used to differentiate\nmarketed crops from subsistence crops, which are those fed to the producer's own\nlivestock or grown as food for the producer's family. In earlier times cash\ncrops were usually only a small (but vital) part of a farm's total yield, while\ntoday, especially in the developed countries, almost all crops are mainly grown\nfor revenue. In least developed countries, cash crops are usually crops which\nattract demand in more developed nations, and hence have some export value.\n\nPrices for major cash crops are set in commodity markets with global scope, with\nsome local variation (termed as \"basis\") based on freight costs and local supply\nand demand balance. A consequence of this is that a nation, region, or\nindividual producer relying on such a crop may suffer low prices should a bumper\ncrop elsewhere lead to excess supply on the global markets. This system has been\ncriticized by traditional farmers. Coffee is an example of a product that has\nbeen susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations.
