{"cursor":"3760","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn graph theory, the term 'cycle' may refer to one of two types of specific\ncycles: a closed walk or simple path. If repeated vertices are allowed, it is\nmore often called a 'closed walk'. If the path is a simple path, with no\nrepeated vertices or edges other than the starting and ending vertices, it may\nalso be called a 'simple cycle', 'circuit', 'circle', or 'polygon'. A cycle in a\ndirected graph is called a directed cycle.\n\nThe term cycle may also refer to:\n* An element of the binary or integral (or real, complex, etc.) cycle space of a\n  graph. This is the usage closest to that in the rest of mathematics, in\n  particular algebraic topology. Such a cycle may be called a binary cycle,\n  integral cycle, etc.\n* An edge set that has even degree at every vertex; also called an even edge set\n  or, when taken together with its vertices, an even subgraph. This is\n  equivalent to a binary cycle, since a binary cycle is the indicator function\n  of an edge set of this type.\n\nChordless cycles in a graph are sometimes called graph holes. A graph antihole\nis the complement of a graph hole.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Cycle_(graph_theory)","recorded":1362478002,"links":20,"instances":["graph_theory","graph_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Graph theory objects"],"headings":["Cycle detection","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Graph_cycle.gif/220px-Graph_cycle.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["path","graph_theory"],["vertex","graph_theory"]],"members":["path","vertex"],"related":["Graph_theory","Path_(graph_theory)","Vertex_(graph_theory)","Cycle_space","Algebraic_topology","Indicator_function","Chordless_cycle","Complement_graph","Depth-first_search","Topological_sorting","Strongly_connected_component","Wait-for_graph","Deadlock","Euler_cycle","Hamiltonian_cycle","Chordal_graph","Bipartite_graph","Perfect_graph"]}
