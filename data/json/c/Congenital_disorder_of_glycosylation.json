Congenital disorders of glycosylation are sometimes\nknown as CDG syndromes. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction\nof several different organ systems (especially the nervous system, muscles, and\nintestines) in affected infants. The most common subtype is CDG-Ia (also\nreferred to as PMM2-CDG) where the genetic defect leads to the loss of\nphosphomannomutase 2, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of mannose-6-\nphosphate into mannose-1-phosphate.\n","linknr":843,"url":"Congenital_disorder_of_glycosylation","recorded":1362898609,"links":20,"instances":["protein","chemistry","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Inborn errors of metabolism","Pediatrics","Glycoprotein metabolism disorders","Membrane transport protein disorders"],"headings":["History","Classification","Presentation","''N''-Glycosylation and known defects","Treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Doichol.png/200px-Doichol.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Dolichol_monophosphate.svg/200px-Dolichol_monophosphate.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Mannose-6-phosphate.svg/200px-Mannose-6-phosphate.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Mannose-1-phosphate.svg/200px-Mannose-1-phosphate.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/DolicholMPM.svg/200px-DolicholMPM.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"],["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["precursor","chemistry"],["chaperone","protein"]],"members":["chaperone","precursor","tissue","locus"],"related":["Inborn_errors_of_metabolism","Glycosylation","Tissue_(biology)","Protein","Lipid","Congenital_disorder","Syndrome","Organ_system","Nervous_system","Muscle","Intestine","Mannose-6-phosphate","Mannose-1-phosphate","Psychomotor_retardation","Cerebral_atrophy","Cerebellar_atrophy","Hormone","Phenotype","Psychomotor_retardation","Ataxia","Strabismus","Congenital_abnormality","Nipples","Coagulopathy","Phosphomannomutase","Mannose-6-phosphate","Mannose-1-phosphate","GDP-mannose","Dolichol","Mannose","Mutation","Phosphomannose_isomerase","Mannose","Metabolic_pathway","Oligosaccharyltransferase","Isoelectric_focusing","ESI-MS","Dystroglycanopathies","Walker-Warburg_syndrome","Muscle-Eye-Brain","Hereditary_multiple_exostoses","Ehlers-Danlos_syndrome","Spondylocostal_dysostosis","Lipid","Oligosaccharide","OMIM","Gene","Locus_(genetics)","PMM2","Mannose_phosphate_isomerase","ALG6","ALG3","DPM1","MPDU1","ALG12","ALG8","ALG2","DPAGT1","ALG1","ALG9","Dolichol_kinase","RFT1","DPM3","ALG11","SRD5A3","DDOST","DPM2","TUSC3","MAGT1","DHDDS","OMIM","Gene","Locus_(genetics)","MGAT2","GCS1","SLC35C1","B4GALT1","COG7","SLC35A1","COG1","COG8","COG5","COG4","COG6","ATP6V0A2","MAN1B1","ST3GAL3","Dystroglycan","Muscular_dystrophy","POMT1","POMT2","POMGNT1","FKTN","FKRP","LARGE","OMIM","Gene","Locus_(genetics)","Walker-Warburg_syndrome","POMT1","Walker-Warburg_syndrome","POMT2","POMGNT1","FKTN","FKRP","LARGE","Ataxia","Seizure","Retinopathy","Liver","Coagulopathy","Failure_to_thrive","Dysmorphic_feature","Inverted_nipple","Subcutaneous","Fat_pad","Strabismus","Myopia","Infantile_esotropia","Delayed_visual_maturation","Low_vision","Optic_pallor","Rod_cell","Electroretinography","Congenital_hyperinsulinism","Hyperinsulinemic_hypoglycemia","Carbohydrates","Asparagine","Asn","N-linked","Oligosaccharide","Biosynthetic_pathway","Glycosyltransferase","Glycosidase","Membrane_transport_protein","Synthase","Protein_folding","Intracellular","Lectins","Selectins","Leukocyte","Glycoprotein","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Asn","Golgi_apparatus","Genes","N-linked_glycosylation","Dolichol","Farnesyl","Precursor_(chemistry)","Cholesterol","Dehydrodolichyl_diphosphate_synthase","Pyrophosphatase","Reductase","Dolichol","Retinitis_pigmentosa","Reductase","SRD5A3","Dol-P","Dol_kinase","ER_membrane","Dolichol_kinase","N-acetylglucosamine","Mannosyltransferase","Nucleotide","UDP-GlcNAc","GDP-mannose","Pyrophosphate","Cytoplasmatic","Endoplasmic_reticulum","DPAGT1","ALG1","ALG2","ALG11","ALG13","ALG14","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Flippase","RFT1","Mannosyltransferase","Glucosyltransferase","Dol-P-Man","Dol-P-glucose","ALG3","ALG9","ALG12","ALG6","ALG8","MPDU-1","MPDU1","GDP-Man","N-glycosylation","Fructose-6-P","Man-6-P","Phosphomannose_isomerase","Man-1-P","Phosphomannomutase","PMM2","Dol-P-Man","Dol-P-Man_synthase","DPM1","DPM2","DPM3","Asn","Oligosaccharyltransferase","Oligosaccharyl_transferase","Lectin","Chaperone_(protein)","Calnexin","Calreticulin","GCS1","Golgi_apparatus","Mannosidase","Galactosylation","Fucosylation","Sialylation","MGAT2","SLC35C1","B4GALT1","Galactosyltransferase","COG7","SLC35A1","Mannose","Fucose","Inborn_error_of_metabolism"]}
