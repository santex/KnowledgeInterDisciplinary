{"cursor":"12692","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n.]] In chemistry, a 'carbide' is a compound composed of carbon and a less\nelectronegative element. Carbides can be generally classified by chemical\nbonding type as follows: (i) salt-like, (ii) covalent compounds, (iii)\ninterstitial compounds, and (iv) \"intermediate\" transition metal carbides.\nExamples include calcium carbide, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide (often\ncalled simply carbide when referring to machine tooling), and cementite, each used in key industrial applications.
