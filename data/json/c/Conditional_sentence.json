{"cursor":"15136","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Conditional sentences' are sentences expressing factual implications, or\nhypothetical situations and their consequences. They are so called because the\nvalidity of the main clause of the sentence is conditional on the existence of\ncertain circumstances, which may be expressed in a dependent clause or may be\nunderstood from the context.\n\nA full conditional sentence (one which expresses the condition as well as its\nconsequences) therefore contains two clauses: the dependent clause expressing\nthe condition, called the 'protasis'; and the main clause expressing the\nconsequence, called the 'apodosis'. Haspelmath, Martin; KÃ¶nig, Ekkehard;\nOesterreicher, Wulf; Raible, Wolfgang: Language Typology and Language\nUniversals, Walter de Gruyter, 2001, p. 1002. An example of such a\nsentence (in English) is the following:\n::If it rains, the picnic will be cancelled.\nHere the condition is expressed by the clause if it rains, this being the\nprotasis, while the consequence is expressed by the picnic will be cancelled,\nthis being the apodosis. (The protasis may either precede or follow the\napodosis; it is equally possible to say \"The picnic will be cancelled if it\nrains\".) In terms of logic, the protasis corresponds to the antecedent, and the\napodosis to the consequent.\n\nLanguages use a variety of grammatical forms and constructions in conditional\nsentences. The forms of verbs used in the protasis and apodosis are often\nsubject to particular rules as regards their tense and mood. Many languages have\na specialized type of verb form called the conditional mood â broadly equivalent\nin meaning to the English \"would (do something)\" â for use in some types of\nconditional sentence.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Conditional_sentence","recorded":1362568026,"links":15,"instances":["linguistics","grammar","mathematics","logic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sentences by type","Conditionals"],"headings":["Types of conditional sentence","Grammar of conditional sentences","Logic","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/2/7/227c9b114a532da05ad4ef8eba3b9563.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","linguistics"],["antecedent","logic"],["conjunction","grammar"],["relation","mathematics"]],"members":["sentence","conjunction","relation","antecedent"],"related":["Sentence_(linguistics)","Implication","Hypothesis","Material_conditional","Main_clause","Dependent_clause","Clause","English_grammar","Logic","Antecedent_(logic)","Consequent","Verb","Grammatical_tense","Grammatical_mood","Conditional_mood","Implication","Hypothesis","Declarative_sentence","Question","Grammatical_tense","Grammatical_mood","Conditional_mood","Grammar","Syntax","Grammatical_tense","Grammatical_mood","Conditional_mood","Conjunction_(grammar)","Subject-auxiliary_inversion","English_language_teaching","Conditional_mood","Shall_and_will","English_subjunctive","Indicative_mood","Past_perfect","Conditional_perfect","English_conditional_sentences","Latin","French_language","Imperfect","Conditional_mood","Pluperfect","Conditional_perfect","French_verbs","Italian_language","Subjunctive","Conditional_mood","Italian_verbs","Slavic_languages","Russian_language","Russian_grammar","Polish_grammar","Material_conditional","Relation_(mathematics)","Indicative_conditional","Counterfactual_conditional","Anankastic_conditional","English_modal_auxiliary_verb","Conditional_mood","Counterfactual_conditional","Subjunctive_mood"]}
