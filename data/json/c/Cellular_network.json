{"cursor":"20831","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'cellular network' or 'mobile network' is a radio network distributed over\nland areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver,\nknown as a cell site or base station. In a cellular network, each cell uses a\ndifferent set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and\nprovide guaranteed bandwidth within each cell.\n\nWhen joined together these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic\narea. This enables a large number of portable transceivers (e.g., mobile phones,\npagers, etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and\ntelephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the\ntransceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.\n\nCellular networks offer a number of advantages over alternative solutions:\n* flexible enough to use the features and functions of almost all public and\n  private networks\n* increased capacity\n* reduced power use\n* larger coverage area\n* reduced interference from other signals\n\nAn example of a simple non-telephone cellular system is an old taxi drivers'\nradio system, in which a taxi company has several transmitters based around a\ncity that can communicate directly with each other.\n","linknr":765,"url":"Cellular_network","recorded":1362371294,"links":49,"instances":["signal_processing","telecommunications"],"pdf":["http://www.nomor.de/uploads/a4/81/a4815c4dc585be33c81f0ec7a15deed7/2010-12-WhitePaper_LTE_HetNet_ICIC.pdf","http://www.nomor.de/uploads/a4/81/a4815c4dc585be33c81f0ec7a15deed7/2010-12-WhitePaper_LTE_HetNet_ICIC.pdf","http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/tech/events/2003/slovenia2003/Presentations/Day%203/3.3.1_Chandler.pdf"],"categories":["Mobile telecommunications","Radio resource management","Telecommunications infrastructure"],"headings":["Concept","Cell signal encoding","Frequency reuse","Directional antennas","Broadcast messages and paging","Movement from cell to cell and handover","Mobile phone network","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Transmitting_tower_top_us.jpg/220px-Transmitting_tower_top_us.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Frequency_reuse.svg/400px-Frequency_reuse.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/9/989ae1e5334f64d4c895363619da1c5e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/CellTowersAtCorners.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/GSM_ArchitecturePL.svg/300px-GSM_ArchitecturePL.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["paging","telecommunications"]],"members":["bandwidth","paging"],"related":["Radio","Transceiver","Cell_site","Base_station","Mobile_phone","Pager","Taxicab","Cellular_radio","Radio_base_station","Co-channel_interference","Channel_capacity","Co-channel_interference","Frequency","Time_division_multiple_access","Frequency_division_multiple_access","Code_division_multiple_access","Transceiver","Polarization_division_multiple_access","Time_division_multiple_access","Time_division_multiple_access","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Code_division_multiple_access","Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiple_access","3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution","Mobile_phone","GSM","UMTS","3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution","Paging_(telecommunications)","CDMA","Short_message_service","UMTS","Handoff","Mobile_phone","Telephone","Cell_site","Radio_wave","Mobile_phone_operator","Telephone_exchange","Public_Switched_Telephone_Network","Global_System_for_Mobile_Communications","CDMA","Advanced_Mobile_Phone_System","Satellite_phone","Global_System_for_Mobile_Communications","General_Packet_Radio_Service","CdmaOne","CDMA2000","Evolution-Data_Optimized","Enhanced_Data_Rates_for_GSM_Evolution","Universal_Mobile_Telecommunications_System","Digital_Enhanced_Cordless_Telecommunications","Digital_AMPS","Integrated_Digital_Enhanced_Network","Base_station","Base_station_subsystem","Network_switching_subsystem","GPRS","Public_switched_telephone_network","GSM","Handoff","Radio_Base_Station","Mobile_switching_center","Public_switched_telephone_network","Frequency_division_multiple_access","Time_division_multiple_access","Code_division_multiple_access","Space_division_multiple_access","CDMA","Pseudorandom_noise","IS-95","Nordic_Mobile_Telephone","UMTS","Signal-to-noise_ratio","Power_control","CDMA2000","Cellular_frequencies","GSM_frequency_bands","UMTS_frequency_bands","Cellular_repeater","Cellular_router","Cellular_traffic","Code_division_multiple_access","MIMO","Network_simulation","OpenBTS","Professional_mobile_radio","Radio_resource_management","Signal_strength","Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health"]}
