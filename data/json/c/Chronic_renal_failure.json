The\nsymptoms of worsening kidney function are non-specific, and might include\nfeeling generally unwell and experiencing a reduced appetite. Often, chronic\nkidney disease is diagnosed as a result of screening of people known to be at\nrisk of kidney problems, such as those with high blood pressure or diabetes and\nthose with a blood relative with chronic kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease\nmay also be identified when it leads to one of its recognized complications,\nsuch as cardiovascular disease, anemia or pericarditis.\n\nChronic kidney disease is identified by a blood test for creatinine. Higher\nlevels of creatinine indicate a lower glomerular filtration rate and as a result\na decreased capability of the kidneys to excrete waste products. Creatinine\nlevels may be normal in the early stages of CKD, and the condition is discovered\nif urinalysis (testing of a urine sample) shows that the kidney is allowing the\nloss of protein or red blood cells into the urine. To fully investigate the\nunderlying cause of kidney damage, various forms of medical imaging, blood tests\nand often renal biopsy (removing a small sample of kidney tissue) are employed\nto find out if there is a reversible cause for the kidney malfunction. Recent professional guidelines classify the severity of chronic\nkidney disease in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually\ncausing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life\nexpectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called 'End Stage Renal Disease\n(ESRD)' and is synonymous with the now outdated terms 'chronic kidney failure\n(CKF)' or 'chronic renal failure' (CRF).\n\nThere is no specific treatment unequivocally shown to slow the worsening of\nchronic kidney disease. If there is an underlying cause to CKD, such as\nvasculitis, this may be treated directly to slow the damage. In more advanced\nstages, treatments may be required for anemia and bone disease. Severe CKD\nrequires renal replacement therapy, which may involve a form of dialysis, but\nideally constitutes a kidney transplant.\n","linknr":716,"url":"Chronic_renal_failure","recorded":1362482001,"links":52,"instances":["medicine","physical","symptom","medicine"],"pdf":["http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph.pdf"],"categories":["Kidney
