      "text" : "\n\n in Japan awaiting the appearance of the Crown Prince Hirohito for the recent\n proclamation of his official recognition as the heir apparent to the Japanese\n Imperial Throne -- New York Times, 1916.]]\n\nA 'crown prince' or 'crown princess' is the heir or heiress apparent to the\nthrone in a royal or imperial monarchy. The wife of a crown prince is also\ntitled crown princess.\n\nThe term is now borne as a title mainly in Asia, Scandinavia, and the Middle\nEast; but it may also be used to refer to the person or position of the heir\napparent in other kingdoms. However, heirs apparent to non-imperial and non-\nroyal monarchies (i.e., wherein the hereditary sovereign holds a title below\nthat of king/queen, e.g., grand duke or prince), crown prince is not used as a\ntitle, although it is sometimes used as a synonym for heir apparent.\n\nIn Europe, where primogeniture governs succession to all monarchies except those\nof the Papacy and Andorra, the eldest son (Spain and the United Kingdom) or\neldest child (Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden) of the\ncurrent monarch fills the role of crown prince or princess, depending upon\nwhether females of the dynasty enjoy personal succession rights. The eldest\nliving child of a monarch is sometimes not the heir apparent or crown prince,\nbecause that position can be held by a descendant of a deceased older child who,\nby \"right of representation\", inherits the same place in the line of succession\nthat would be held by the ancestor if he or she were still living (e.g., Carl\nGustaf, Duke of Jämtland, was de facto Crown Prince of Sweden from 1950 to 1973,\nas the senior grandson by male primogeniture of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden,\nalthough the former Prince Sigvard, Duke of Uppland, was Gustaf VI's eldest\nliving son, and Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, his eldest living dynastic son\nduring those years).\n\nIn some monarchies, those of the Middle East for example, in which primogeniture\nis not the decisive factor in dynastic succession, a person may not possess the\ntitle or status of crown prince by right of birth, but may obtain (and lose) it\nas a result of an official designation made on some other legal or traditional\nbasis, e.g., former Crown Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan.\n\nCompare heir apparent and heir presumptive. In Scandinavian kingdoms, the heir\npresumptive to the crown holds a different title than the heir apparent;\nHereditary Prince (German: Erbprinz, French: prince héréditaire). That is also\nthe title borne by the heirs apparent of Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, and by\nthe heir or heiress presumptive of Monaco. In the Germanic monarchies abolished\nin 1918, hereditary prince, rather than crown prince, was also the title borne\nby the heirs apparent of the kingdoms of Bavaria, Hanover, Saxony and\nWürttemberg, as well as those of grand duchies, of sovereign duchies and\nprincipalities, and of mediatized princely families.\n",
