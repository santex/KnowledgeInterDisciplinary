They are sometimes also called the 'Bernardines' or the 'White Monks',\nin reference to the colour of the habit, over which a black scapular is worn.\nThe emphasis of Cistercian life is on manual labour and self-sufficiency, and\nmany abbeys have traditionally supported themselves through activities such as\nagriculture and brewing ales.\n\nThe term Cistercian (French Cistercien), derives from Cistercium, The\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd ed., 1992. the\nLatin name for the village of CÃ®teaux, near Dijon in eastern France. It was in\nthis village that a group of Benedictine monks from the monastery of Molesme\nfounded CÃ®teaux Abbey in 1098, with the goal of following more closely the Rule\nof Saint Benedict. The best known of them were Robert of Molesme, Alberic of\nCÃ®teaux and the English monk Stephen Harding, who were the first three abbots.\nBernard of Clairvaux entered the monastery in the early 1110s with 30 companions\nand helped the rapid proliferation of the order. By the end of the 12th century,\nthe order had spread throughout France and into England, Wales, Scotland,\nIreland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe keynote of Cistercian life was a return to literal observance of the Rule of\nSt Benedict. Rejecting the developments the Benedictines had undergone, the\nmonks tried to replicate monastic life exactly as it had been in Saint\nBenedict's time; indeed in various points they went beyond it in austerity. The\nmost striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, especially\nfield-work, a special characteristic of Cistercian life. Cistercian architecture\nis considered one of the most beautiful styles of medieval\narchitecture. http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16025b.htm Additionally,\nin relation to fields such as agriculture, hydraulic engineering and metallurgy,\nthe Cistercians became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval\nEurope. The Cistercians were adversely affected in England by the Protestant\nReformation, the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII, the\nFrench Revolution in continental Europe, and the revolutions of the 18th\ncentury, but some survived and the order recovered in the 19th century. In 1891\ncertain abbeys formed a new Order called Trappists (Ordo Cisterciensium\nStrictioris Observantiae â OCSO), which today exists as an order distinct from\nthe 'Common Observance'.\n","linknr":1344,"url":"Cistercians","recorded":1362670066,"links":97,"instances":["roman_catholic","county_wexford","science_historian","province","religious","roman_catholic","liturgy","region","architecture","architecture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cistercian
