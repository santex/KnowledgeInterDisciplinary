{"cursor":"5349","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Software for chess problems' is a category of software intended for handling\nchess problems, usually distinct from [[Computer chess|chess playing and\nanalyzing programs]]. Chess problems are based on the rules of chess, but\nproblemists may have little use for ordinary chess playing programs. Many chess\nplaying programs also have an option for solving directmates, i.e. mates in two,\nthree, four, and more moves, and some of them also have support for helpmates\nand selfmates.\n\nSoftware for chess problems can be used for creating and solving problems,\nincluding checking the soundness of a concept and position, storing it in a\ndatabase, printing and publishing, and saving and exporting the problem. They\ncan solve direct mates, helpmates and selfmates and even problems with fairy\npieces and other fairy chess problems. There have also been some attempts to\nhave computers \"compose\" problems.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Chess_Problem_Database_Server","recorded":1362482893,"links":8,"instances":["programming_language","programming_language","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chess problems","Chess software","Lists of software|Chess problems"],"headings":["Alybadix","LaTeX Diagram Style","Popeye","Chloe and Winchloe","Natch and iNatch","Problemist(e)","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["c","programming_language"],["pascal","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"]],"members":["c","java","pascal"],"related":["Computer_software","Chess_problem","Chess_composer","Helpmate","Selfmate","Database","Fairy_chess_piece","Fairy_chess","DOS","Commodore_64","Printing","LaTeX","TeX","Die_Schwalbe","Command-line_interface","C_(programming_language)","LaTeX","Pascal_(programming_language)","MS-DOS","Free_software","Retrograde_analysis","Proof_game","Java_(programming_language)","Monochromatic_chess","Reflexmate","Chess_aesthetics"]}
