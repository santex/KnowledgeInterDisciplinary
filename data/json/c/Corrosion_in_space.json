In the upper layers of the atmosphere (between\n90â800 km), the atmospheric atoms, ions and free radicals, most notably\natomic oxygen, play a major role. The concentration of atomic oxygen depends on\naltitude and solar activity, as the bursts of ultraviolet radiation cause\nphotodissociation of molecular oxygen.  Between 160 and 560 km, the\natmosphere consists of about 90% atomic oxygen.
