While humans, as well as other vertebrates, have a closed\ncardiovascular system (meaning that the blood never leaves the network of\narteries, veins and capillaries), some invertebrate groups have an open\ncardiovascular system. The more primitive, diploblastic animal phyla lack\ncirculatory systems. The lymphatic system, on the other hand, is an open system\nproviding an accessory route for excess interstitial fluid to get returned to\nthe blood. [http://books.google.com/books?id=I9qH3eZ1pP0C&pg=PT401#v=onepag-\ne&q&f=false Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems, by Lauralee Sherwood]\n\nTwo types of fluids move through the circulatory system: blood and lymph. Lymph\nis essentially recycled blood plasma after it has been filtered from the blood\ncells and returned to the lymphatic system. The blood, heart, and blood vessels\nform the cardiovascular (from Latin words meaning 'heart'-'vessel') system. The\nlymph, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels form the lymphatic system. The\ncardiovascular system and the lymphatic system collectively make up the\ncirculatory system.\n","linknr":1327,"url":"Cardiovascular","recorded":1362503679,"links":119,"instances":["chemistry","anatomy","biology","biology","biology","heart","heart"],"pdf":["http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf"],"categories":["Circulatory
