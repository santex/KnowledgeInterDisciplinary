{"cursor":"772","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'cell' in the context of electronic design automation (EDA) is an abstract\nrepresentation of a component within a schematic diagram or physical layout of\nan electronic circuit in software.\n\nA cell-based design methodology is a technique that enables designers to analyze\nchip designs at varying levels of abstraction. For example, one designer may\nfocus on the logical function (high-level) and another may concentrate on\nphysical implementation (low-level). The technique also enables designers to\nreuse components in more complex designs without understanding all of the\nimplementation details.\n","linknr":82,"url":"Cell_(EDA)","recorded":1362371294,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic design automation"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Nuvola_apps_ksim.png/30px-Nuvola_apps_ksim.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Electronic_design_automation","Schematic_diagram","Physical_layout","Standard_Cell","PCell","Integrated_Circuits","Circuit_Design"]}
