The increased acidity causes the milk proteins (casein)\nto tangle into solid masses, or curds. The remaining liquid, which contains only\nwhey proteins, is the whey. In cow's milk, 80% of the proteins are caseins. Milk\nthat has been left to sour (raw milk alone or pasteurized milk with added lactic\nacid bacteria or yeast) will also naturally produce curds, and sour milk cheese\nis produced this way.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Curds","recorded":1362672384,"links":34,"instances":["dish","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dairy products","Milk","Cheese"],"headings":["Uses","Curds in song and poetry","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Twarog.jpg/220px-Twarog.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Cheese_Curds_with_scale_measurement.png/180px-Cheese_Curds_with_scale_measurement.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Kaaspers_antiek.jpg/220px-Kaaspers_antiek.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["quark","food"],["paskha","dish"]],"members":["paskha","quark"],"related":["Dairy_product","Milk","Rennet","Acid","Lemon_juice","Vinegar","Casein","Whey_protein","Whey","Pasteurized_milk","Lactic_acid_bacteria","Sour_milk_cheese","Cottage_cheese","Quark_(food)","Paneer","Turkey","Keş","Fried_bread","Bolu_Province","Zonguldak_Province","Cheese_curds","French-speaking","Quebec","Ontario","Atlantic_Canada","Cheddar_cheese","New_Brunswick","French_fries","Gravy","Wisconsin","Parody","Buffalo_curd","Coalhada","Curd_snack","Thayir_sadam","India","Ostkaka","Paneer","Paskha_(dish)","Easter","Qurut","Ricotta","Skyr","Tofu","Túró_Rudi"]}
