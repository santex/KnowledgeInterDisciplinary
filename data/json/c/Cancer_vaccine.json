Vaccines that treat\nexisting cancer are known as therapeutic cancer vaccines. There are currently no\nvaccines able to prevent cancer in general.\n\nSome types of cancer, such as cervical cancer and some liver cancers, are caused\nby viruses, and traditional vaccines against those viruses, such as HPV vaccine\nand hepatitis B vaccine, will prevent those types of cancer. These anti-viral\nvaccines are not further discussed in the rest of this article.
