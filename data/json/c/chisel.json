The\nhandle and blade of some types of chisel are made of metal or wood with a sharp\nedge in it.\n\nIn use, the chisel is forced into the material to cut it. The driving force may\nbe manually applied or applied using a mallet or hammer. In industrial use, a\nhydraulic ram or falling weight ('trip hammer') drives the chisel into the\nmaterial to be cut.\n\nA gouge, one type of chisel, is used, particularly in woodworking,\nwoodturning and sculpture, to carve small pieces from the material. Gouges\nare most often used in creating concave surfaces. A gouge typically has a 'U'-\nshaped cross-section.\n",
