{"cursor":"20272","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'CANopen' is a communication protocol and device profile specification for\nembedded systems used in automation. In terms of the OSI model, CANopen\nimplements the layers above and including the network layer. The CANopen\nstandard consists of an addressing scheme, several small communication protocols\nand an application layer defined by a device profile. The communication\nprotocols have support for network management, device monitoring and\ncommunication between nodes, including a simple transport layer for message\nsegmentation/desegmentation. The lower level protocol implementing the data link\nand physical layers is usually Controller Area Network (CAN), although devices\nusing some other means of communication (such as Ethernet Powerlink, EtherCAT)\ncan also implement the CANopen device profile.\n\nThe basic CANopen device and communication profiles are given in the CiA 301\nspecification released by CAN in Automation. Profiles for more specialized\ndevices are built on top of this basic profile, and are specified in numerous\nother standards released by CAN in Automation, such as CiA 401 for I/O-modules\nand CiA 402 for motion control.\n","linknr":170,"url":"CANopen","recorded":1362535239,"links":19,"instances":["computing","computer_science","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Network protocols","Industrial automation"],"headings":["Device model","Communication","Electronic Data Sheet","Glossary of CANopen terms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["protocol","computing"],["integer","computer_science"],["pascal","unit"]],"members":["protocol","integer","pascal"],"related":["Protocol_(computing)","Embedded_system","Automation","OSI_model","Network_layer","Application_layer","Transport_layer","Data_link_layer","Physical_layer","CAN_bus","Ethernet_Powerlink","EtherCAT","CAN_in_Automation","Finite-state_machine_","Datatype","Boolean_data_type","Integer_(computer_science)","Floating_point","INI_file","CAN_bus","Pascal_(unit)","XML","International_Organization_for_Standardization","CAN_bus","DeviceNet","IEEE_1451","TransducerML"]}
