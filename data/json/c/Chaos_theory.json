Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding\nerrors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such\ndynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in\ngeneral. This happens even though these systems are deterministic,\nmeaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial\nconditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the\ndeterministic nature of these systems does not make them\npredictable. This behavior is known\nas deterministic chaos, or simply chaos.\n\nChaotic behavior can be observed in many natural systems, such as weather. Explanation of such behavior may be sought through\nanalysis of a chaotic mathematical model, or through analytical techniques such\nas recurrence plots and PoincarÃ© maps.\n","linknr":1074,"url":"Chaos_theory","recorded":1362476973,"links":94,"instances":["mathematics","journal","mathematics","independent_filmmaker","video_game","mathematics","physicist","mathematician","physicist","topology","vector_space","jurassic_park_character","author"],"pdf":["http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf","http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf","http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/~george/publications/90_nonlinear_forecasting.pdf","http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/~george/publications/90_nonlinear_forecasting.pdf","http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1576/01/MPRA_paper_1576.pdf","http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1576/01/MPRA_paper_1576.pdf","http://www.physics.bristol.ac.uk/people/berry_mv/the_papers/Berry358.pdf","http://www.physics.bristol.ac.uk/people/berry_mv/the_papers/Berry358.pdf","http://cstrelioff.bol.ucla.edu/documents/StrelioffHubler2006.pdf","http://server17.how-why.com/blog/ManagingChaos.pdf","http://server17.how-why.com/blog/ManagingChaos.pdf"],"categories":["Chaos
