He retired with the most career receptions,\n  receiving yards, and games played of any wide receiver in NFL history. He was\n  elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996. Joiner was last the wide\n  receivers coach of the San Diego Chargers. He was hired by the Chargers on\n  January 23, 2008, following seven seasons in the same coaching position with\n  the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nJoiner graduated from Grambling State University in 1969 and was drafted in the\nfourth round by the American Football League's Houston Oilers. He started his\ncareer as a defensive back, but he made the switch to wide receiver in his\nrookie year after being carted off the field from a hit by Denver Broncos\nrunning back Floyd Little. Joiner played for Houston until 1972, when\nhe was traded to Cincinnati. From 1972 to 1975 he played for the Cincinnati\nBengals. In 1975 he was traded to the San Diego Chargers, with whom he remained\nfor eleven seasons before retiring as a player after the 1986 season. Before\nleaving the Bengals, he set a franchise record with 200 receiving yards in a\nsingle game. [http://www.bengals.com/team/history/regular_individual.asp\nRegular Season Individual Records - Cincinnati Bengals ]\n\nIt was with the Chargers' high flying \"Air Coryell\" offense under coach Don\nCoryell that Joiner had his most productive years, exceeding 1,000 yards\nreceiving in a season four times and going to three Pro Bowls (1976, 1979â80).\nJoiner was selected All-Pro in 1980 and 2nd Team All-AFC in 1976. Although he\nnever played in a Super Bowl, Joiner helped the Chargers reach the AFC title\ngame in the 1980 and 1981 seasons. In the 1980 AFC championship game, he caught\n6 passes for 130 yards and 2 touchdowns. In January 1982, he played a key role\nin San Diego's 41-38 divisional postseason overtime win over the Miami Dolphins\nin a game that is known in NFL Lore as The Epic In Miami. Joiner caught 7 passes\nfor 108 yards in the game, including 2 key receptions on his team's game winning\ndrive in overtime. His 29-yard reception on the penultimate play of the game set\nup the winning field goal.\n\nJoiner finished his 18 AFL/NFL seasons with 750 receptions for 12,146 yards and\n65 touchdowns. He retired as the then-NFL leader in career receptions, yards,\nand games played by a wide receiver (239). Joiner credited his\nsuccess and longevity to Coryell: \"Thanks to Coach Coryellâs offense and his\nrevolutionary passing game, he prolonged my career, from the day I got to the\nChargers until the day I retired. I will forever be grateful to him and what he\ndid for the game of football. {{cite web\n  | last = Center first = Bill title = Don Coryell, ex-Chargers, Aztecs coach\n  | dies at 85 publisher = San Diego Union-Tribune url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/01/don-\n  | coryell/ accessdate = 2010-07-02 }} â\n\nIn addition to good health and longevity, Joiner was an intelligent player and\nprecise pass route runner. Jaworski 2010, p.81 Hall of Fame coach Bill\nWalsh called Joiner \"the most intelligent, the smartest, the most calculating\nreceiver the game has ever known.\" Following his playing career,\nJoiner successfully transitioned into a receiver's coach with the Kansas City\nChiefs and the San Diego Chargers. Joiner was the last former American Football\nLeague player (Oilers, 1969) to retire from Professional Football, in 1986.\n\nIn 1999, he was ranked number 100 on [[The Sporting News]]' list of the 100\nGreatest Football Players.\n","linknr":342,"url":"Charlie_Joiner","recorded":1375056787,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Joiner&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Joiner&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Wide_Receiver","/wiki/Many,_Louisiana","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/Grambling_State","/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft","/wiki/1969_NFL_Draft","/wiki/Houston_Oilers","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Houston_Oilers","/wiki/1969_AFL_season","/wiki/Houston_Oilers","/wiki/1972_NFL_season","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals","/wiki/1972_NFL_season","/wiki/1975_NFL_season","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/1976_NFL_season","/wiki/1986_NFL_season","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/1987_NFL_season","/wiki/1991_NFL_season","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/1992_NFL_season","/wiki/2000_NFL_season","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/2001_NFL_season","/wiki/2007_NFL_season","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/2008_NFL_season","/wiki/2012_NFL_season","/wiki/Pro_Bowl","/wiki/1977_Pro_Bowl","/wiki/1980_Pro_Bowl","/wiki/1981_Pro_Bowl","/wiki/All-Pro","/wiki/1980_All-Pro_Team","/wiki/List_of_San_Diego_Chargers_Hall_of_Fame_inductees","/wiki/List_of_San_Diego_Chargers_50th_Anniversary_Team","/wiki/List_of_San_Diego_Chargers_40th_Anniversary_Team","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Touchdowns","http://www.nfl.com/players/profile?id=JOI207645","http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?PLAYER_ID=107","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Wide_receiver","/wiki/Reception_(American_football)","/wiki/Receiving_yards","/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/Grambling_State_University","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Houston_Oilers","/wiki/Defensive_back","/wiki/Floyd_Little","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Air_Coryell","/wiki/Don_Coryell","/wiki/Pro_Bowl","/wiki/Miami_Dolphins","/wiki/NFL_Lore","/wiki/The_Epic_In_Miami","/wiki/List_of_National_Football_League_receiving_yards_leaders","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach)","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/The_Sporting_News","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Joiner&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_American_Football_League_players","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Joiner&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-345-51795-1","#cite_ref-2","http://www.bengals.com/team/history/regular_individual.asp","#cite_ref-3","http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hZBcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4FcNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6772,2280565&dq=joiner+12146&hl=en","/wiki/Merced_Sun-Star","/wiki/Associated_Press","#cite_ref-4","http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jul/01/don-coryell/","#cite_ref-5","#Jaworski","#cite_ref-6","http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?player_id=107","/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Joiner&action=edit&section=3","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JoinCh00.htm","http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=107","http://www.chargers.com/team/coaches/charlie-joiner/a2b7bb30-ff99-4553-8f52-267b0186f3f6","/wiki/Template:NFL_wide_receivers_coach_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:NFL_wide_receivers_coach_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NFL_wide_receivers_coach_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_current_National_Football_League_staffs","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/American_Football_Conference","/wiki/AFC_East","/wiki/AFC_North","/wiki/AFC_South","/wiki/AFC_West","/wiki/Ike_Hilliard","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/Ken_O%27Keefe","/wiki/Miami_Dolphins","/wiki/Chad_O%27Shea","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/Sanjay_Lal","/wiki/New_York_Jets","/wiki/Jim_Hostler","/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens","/wiki/James_Urban","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals","/w/index.php?title=Scott_Turner_(American_football_coach)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cleveland_Browns","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Mann_(American_football)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers","/wiki/Larry_Kirksey","/wiki/Houston_Texans","/w/index.php?title=Charlie_Willia
