{"cursor":"10157","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Customer service' is the provision of service to customers before, during and\nafter a purchase. According to Turban et al. (2002), \"Customer\nservice is a series of activities designed to enhance the level of customer\nsatisfaction â that is, the feeling that a product or service has met the\ncustomer expectation.\"\n\nThe importance of customer service may vary by product or service, industry and\ncustomer. The perception of success of such interactions will be dependent on\nemployees \"who can adjust themselves to the personality of the\nguest,\" according to Micah Solomon. From the point of view of an\noverall sales process engineering effort, customer service plays an important\nrole in an organization's ability to generate income and revenue. From that perspective, customer service should be\nincluded as part of an overall approach to systematic improvement. A customer\nservice experience can change the entire perception a customer has of the\norganization.\n\nSome have argued that the quality and level of customer service has\ndecreased in recent years, and that this can be attributed to a lack of support\nor understanding at the executive and middle management levels of a corporation\nand/or a customer service policy. To address this argument, many organizations\nhave employed a variety of methods to improve their customer satisfaction\nlevels, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).\n","linknr":180,"url":"Customer_service","recorded":1362560717,"links":28,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Customer experience management"],"headings":["Customer support","Automated customer service","Instant feedback","Standardization","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Automated_online_assistant.png/170px-Automated_online_assistant.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["service","economics"],["avatar","computing#artificial_intelligence"],["avatar","computing#artificial_intelligence"]],"members":["avatar","service"],"related":["Service_(economics)","Customer","Sales_process_engineering","Key_performance_indicator","Technical_support","Push-button_telephone","Self_service","Artificial_intelligence","Automated_online_assistant","Chatterbot","Natural_language_processing","Key_Performance_Indicator","International_Organization_for_Standardization","The_International_Customer_Service_Institute","Information_Technology","Customer_experience_management","Customer_experience_transformation","Customer_relationship_management","Customer_service_advisor","Customer_service_representative","Customer_service_training","Demand_chain","Institute_of_Customer_Service","Privacy_policy","Public_Services","Sales","Sales_process_engineering","Service_system","Support_automation","Technical_support","Sales_territory","Social_skills"]}
