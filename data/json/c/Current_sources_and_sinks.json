While\ncurrent sources or sinks are abstract elements used for analysis, generally\nthey have physical counterparts in real-world applications; e.g. the anode or\ncathode in a battery. In all cases, each of the opposing terms (source or\nsink) may refer to the same object, depending on the perspective of the\nobserver and the sign convention being used; there is no intrinsic difference\nbetween a source and a sink.\n\nIn some cases, the term current source refers to a boundary where current flows\nfrom locations where it is not measured to locations where it is measured. In a\nsimilar fashion, a current sink may refer to the boundary where current flows\nfrom locations where it is measured to locations where it is not measured. By\nanalogy to the flow of water, a current source would be like a mountain spring -\nwater flows from its source (a hidden location underground) to the surface where\nit is easily observed. Using the same analogy, a current sink would be like\nwater flowing down a drain - water travels from where it is observed to where it\nis not observed.\n\nIn Simple Sink current is the total current consumption on each lines required\nfor operation (Taking from other devices) and source current is the current at\nwhich it can able drive the devices which is connected on each lines (Supplying\nto the other devices). In design the sink and source current plays a major role\nso proper clarification is required.\n\n\n\nShown at right is a general two-compartment model to help illustrate the\ndefinition of current sources or sinks. In this two-compartment model, the\ncompartments are separated by a semi-conductive barrier (gray). An observer,\nsymbolized by the eye, can \"see\" only one compartment at a time. Red arrows\nindicate the direction of flow of positive charges, while black arrows indicate\nthe direction of flow of negative charges. The pink and green backgrounds are\nmeant to symbolize different configurations, configuration 1 when charges are\nflowing in one direction and configuration 2 when they are flowing in the\nopposite direction. The difference between the left and right panels is simply\nthe location of the \"eye\".\n\nA source or a sink is defined by which compartment is viewable by the observer.\n* A 'source' is: ** A flow of positive charges from the \"invisible\" to the\n  \"visible\" compartment (i.e. toward the eye), or... ** A flow of negative\n  charges from the \"visible\" to the \"invisible\" (away from the eye).\n* A 'sink' is: ** A flow of positive charges \"away from the eye\", or... ** A\n  flow of negative charges \"toward the eye\".\n\nIn biology, the schematic barrier in the figure could represent a cell membrane,\nand as a result, the two compartments could represent the inside and the outside\nof the cell. Generally speaking the point of observation would be outside the\ncell. Thus the cell would be termed a sink with respect to any flow of positive\ncharges into it, and the cell would act as a source for any positive charges\nflowing out of it. Note that when considering the flow of negative charges, the\ndefinitions are reversed.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Current_sources_and_sinks","recorded":1374546378,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Electric_current","/wiki/Anode","/wiki/Cathode","/wiki/Battery_(electricity)","/wiki/Sign_convention","/wiki/Spring_(hydrosphere)","/wiki/File:Two_compartment_model_source_and_sink.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Two_compartment_model_source_and_sink.jpg/500px-Two_compartment_model_source_and_sink.jpg","/wiki/File:Two_compartment_model_source_and_sink.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","#Current_sources_and_sinks_in_neurobiology","#Current_source_density_analysis","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Electrophysiology","/wiki/Eeg","/wiki/Extracellular_field_potential","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Point_source","#cite_note-2","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/4/ff43d4487832f07333b820db2f82f44d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/1/571286850423e91db6d2802a4857bf03.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b43b0aee35624cd95b910189b3dc231.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/d/7/dd7536794b63bf90eccfd37f9b147d7f.png","/wiki/Conductivity_(electrolytic)","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/4/9d43cb8bbcb702e9d5943de477f099e2.png","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Current_source","/wiki/Current_mirror","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/PubMed_Identifier","//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/805215","#cite_ref-2","http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100107104048AAU9pXD","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&oldid=564031334","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Electrical_systems","/wiki/Category:Electromagnetism","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_March_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Current+sources+and+sinks&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Current+sources+and+sinks","/wiki/Current_sources_and_sinks","/wiki/Talk:Current_sources_and_sinks","#","/wiki/Current_sources_and_sinks","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Current_sources_and_sinks","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Current_sources_and_sinks","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&oldid=564031334","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5195117","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Current_sources_and_sinks&id=564031334","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Current+sources+and+sinks","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Current+sources+and+sinks&oldid=564031334&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Current_sources_and_sinks&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5195117#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wik
