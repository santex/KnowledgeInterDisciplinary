Willem Hackmann, \"[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Lib-\nri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap5/5new.pdf The Enigma of Volta's \"Contact\nTension\" and the Development of the \"Dry Pile\"]\", appearing in\n[http://ppp.unipv.it/PagesIT/NuovaVoltFrame.htm Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta\nand His Times] Volume 3 (Fabio Bevilacqua; Lucio Frenonese (Editors)), (2000)\npp. 103-119 In the late 18th century, scientists developed sensitive\ninstruments for detecting 'electrification', otherwise known as electrostatic\ncharge imbalance. The phenomenon of electrification by contact, or contact\ntension, was quickly discovered. When two objects were touched together,\nsometimes the objects became spontaneously charged. One object developed a net\nnegative charge, while the other developed an equal and opposite positive\ncharge. Then it was discovered that 'piles' of dissimilar metal disks separated\nby acid-soaked cloth, Voltaic piles, could also produce charge differences.\nAlthough it was later found that these effects were caused by different physical\nprocesses - triboelectricity, the Volta effect, differing work functions of\nmetals, and others - at the time they were all thought to be caused by a common\n'contact electrification' process.\n\nThe contact electrification phenomenon allowed the construction of so-called\n'frictional' electrostatic generators such as Ramsden's or Winter's machines,\nbut it also led directly to the development of much modern electrical technology\nsuch as batteries, fuel cells, electroplating, thermocouples, and semiconductor\njunction devices including radio detector diodes, photocells, LEDs, and\nthermoelectric cells.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Contact_electrification","recorded":1362485708,"links":16,"instances":["electricity","electricity"],"pdf":["http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap5/5new.pdf"],"categories":["Electrical phenomena","History of physics","Obsolete scientific theories"],"headings":["History","Triboelectric contact","Electrolytic-metallic contact","Metallic contact","Semiconductor contact","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["battery","electricity"],["insulator","electricity"],["battery","electricity"]],"members":["insulator","battery"],"related":["Superseded_scientific_theory","Age_of_Enlightenment","Electrical_charge","Electrostatics","Voltaic_pile","Triboelectricity","Work_function","Electrostatic_generator","Battery_(electricity)","Fuel_cell","Electroplating","Thermocouple","Crystal_radio_receiver","Solar_cell","Light-emitting_diode","Thermoelectric_cell","Static_electricity","Electrochemistry","Chemistry","Electron","Atom","Corrosion","Electric_potential","Contact_potential_difference","Alessandro_Volta","Capacitance_electroscope","High_voltage","Dry_pile","Oxford_Electric_Bell","Insulator_(electricity)","High_voltage","Quantum_tunneling","Scientific_Revolution","Electrolyte","Half-cell_reaction","Electrical_double_layer","Galvanic_cell","Battery_(electricity)","Work_function","Electric_potential","Diode","Rectifier","Semiconductor_device","Semiconductor_physics","Direct_band_gap","Solar_cell","Light-emitting_diode"]}
