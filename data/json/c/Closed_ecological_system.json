{"cursor":"1948","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Closed ecological systems' (CES) are ecosystems that do not rely on matter\nexchange with any part outside the system.\n\nThe term is most often used to describe small ecosystems. Such systems are\nscientifically interesting and can potentially serve as a life support system\nduring space flights, in space stations or space habitats.\n\nIn a closed ecological system, any waste products produced by one species must\nbe used by at least one other species. If the purpose is to maintain a life\nform, such as a mouse or a human, waste products such as carbon dioxide, feces\nand urine must eventually be converted into oxygen, food, and water.\n\nA closed ecological system must contain at least one autotrophic organism. While\nboth chemotrophic and phototrophic organisms are plausible, almost all closed\necological systems to date are based on a phototroph such as green algae.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Closed_ecological_system","recorded":1362373438,"links":22,"instances":["aquarium"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecological processes","Systems ecology"],"headings":["Examples","See also","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Biosphere2_1.jpg/300px-Biosphere2_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg/40px-Secondary_succesion_cm01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Gas_giants_in_the_solar_system.jpg/30px-Gas_giants_in_the_solar_system.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ecosphere","aquarium"]],"members":["ecosphere"],"related":["Ecosystems","Life_support_system","Space_flight","Space_stations","Space_habitat","Mouse","Human","Carbon_dioxide","Feces","Urine","Oxygen","Food","Water","Autotroph","Chemotroph","Phototroph","Algae","Biosphere_2","MELiSSA","BIOS-1","BIOS-2","BIOS-3","Ecosphere_(aquarium)","Shrimp","Algae","Gravel","Animal_shell","Gorgonia","Bottle_garden","Biosphere","Controlled_Ecological_Life_Support_System","Ecology","Eden_Project","Space_colonization","Spome","Terraforming","Integrated_biotectural_system"]}
