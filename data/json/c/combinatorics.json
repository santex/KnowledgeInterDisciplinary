Aspects of combinatorics include counting the\nstructures of a given kind and size (enumerative combinatorics), deciding when\ncertain criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the\ncriteria (as in combinatorial designs and matroid theory), finding \"largest\",\n\"smallest\", or \"optimal\" objects (extremal combinatorics and combinatorial\noptimization), and studying combinatorial structures arising in an algebraic\ncontext, or applying algebraic techniques to combinatorial problems (algebraic\ncombinatorics).\n\nCombinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in\nalgebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry,<ref>Björner and Stanley, p.\n2</ref> and combinatorics also has many applications in optimization, computer\nscience, ergodic theory and statistical physics. Many combinatorial questions\nhave historically been considered in isolation, giving an ad hoc solution to a\nproblem arising in some mathematical context. In the later twentieth century,\nhowever, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making\ncombinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right. One of\nthe oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory, which\nalso has numerous natural connections to other areas. Combinatorics is used\nfrequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis\nof algorithms.\n\nA mathematician who studies combinatorics is called a combinatorialist.\n","title":"combinatorics","headings":["History","Approaches and subfields of combinatorics","Related fields","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Number_theory","3: Combinatorial_design","3: Geometry","3: Computer_science","3: Ergodic_theory","3: Analysis_of_algorithms","3: Abstract_algebra","3: Discrete_geometry","2: Mathematics","2: Enumerative_combinatorics","2: Combinatorial_optimization","2: Algebra","2: Algebraic_combinatorics","2: Probability_theory","2: Topology","2: Statistical_physics","2: Graph_theory","2: Mathematician","2: Richard_P._Stanley","2: Partition_of_a_set","2: Asymptotic_analysis","2: Tutte_polynomial","2: Combinatorial_geometry","2: Group_theory","2: Probability","2: Convex_polytope","2: Coding_theory","1: Countable_set","1: Discrete_mathematics","1: Mathematical_structure","1: Matroid","1: Extremal_combinatorics","1: Ancient_history","1: Physician","1: Sushruta","1: Sushruta_Samhita","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Historian","1: Plutarch","1: Chrysippus","1: Hipparchus","1: SchrÃ¶der_number","1: Archimedes","1: Tiling_puzzle","1: Middle_Ages","1: Culture_of_Europe","1: India","1: Permutation","1: Combination","1: Philosopher","1: Astronomer","1: Abraham_ibn_Ezra","1: Binomial_coefficient","1: Talmudist","1: Levi_ben_Gerson","1: Pascal's_triangle","1: Medieval_England","1: Campanology","1: Hamiltonian_cycle","1: Cayley_graph","1: Renaissance","1: Science","1: Blaise_Pascal","1: Isaac_Newton","1: Jacob_Bernoulli","1: Leonard_Euler","1: James_Joseph_Sylvester","1: Percy_Alexander_MacMahon","1: Four_color_problem","1: Functional_analysis","1: Catalan_number","1: Mathematical_problem","1: Fibonacci_numbers","1: Twelvefold_way","1: Permutations","1: Combinations","1: Complex_analysis","1: Generating_functions","1: Integer_partition","1: Q-series","1: Special_functions","1: Orthogonal_polynomials","1: Analysis","1: Bijective_proof","1: Analytic_number_theory","1: Statistical_mechanics","1: Set_intersection","1: Block_design","1: Kirkman's_schoolgirl_problem","1: Steiner_system","1: Classification_of_finite_simple_groups","1: Euclidean_plane","1: Real_projective_space","1: Power_set","1: Inclusion_map","1: Partially_ordered_sets","1: Boolean_algebras","1: Vector_space","1: Linear_independence","1: Hassler_Whitney","1: Set_system","1: Complete_bipartite_graph","1: Ramsey_theory","1: Sufficiently_large","1: Pigeonhole_principle","1: Lattice_graph","1: Random_graph","1: Probabilistic_method","1: Markov_chains","1: Markov_chain_mixing_time","1: Paul_ErdÅ‘s","1: Additive_number_theory","1: Probabilistic_number_theory","1: Representation_theory","1: Combinatorial_commutative_algebra","1: Formal_language","1: Fractal_analysis","1: Theoretical_computer_science","1: Automata_theory","1: Linguistics","1: Chomskyâ€“SchÃ¼tzenberger_hierarchy","1: Formal_grammar","1: Convex_geometry","1: Polyhedral_combinatorics","1: Metric_geometry","1: Permutohedron","1: Associahedron","1: Birkhoff_polytope","1: Graph_coloring","1: Fair_division","1: Partially_ordered_set","1: Decision_tree","1: Necklace_problem","1: Discrete_Morse_theory","1: Combinatorial_topology","1: Algebraic_topology","1: Harmonic_analysis","1: Dynamical_system","1: Set_theory","1: Mathematical_logic","1: Gian-Carlo_Rota","1: Measure_theory","1: Operations_research","1: Computational_complexity_theory","1: Error-correcting_code","1: Information_theory","1: Kissing_number","1: Computational_geometry","1: Combinatorics_and_dynamical_systems","1: Graph_dynamical_system","1: Combinatorics_and_physics","1: Ising_model","1: Potts_model","1: Chromatic_polynomial","1: Combinatorial_biology","1: Combinatorial_chemistry","1: Combinatorial_data_analysis","1: Combinatorial_game_theory","1: Combinatorial_group_theory","1: List_of_combinatorics_topics","1: Phylogenetics","1: Cambridge_University_Press","1: EncyclopÃ¦dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","1: MathWorld"]}
