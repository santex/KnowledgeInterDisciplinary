Regional subcommittees nominate several members as Life\nMembers based upon character, leadership abilities and volunteer service. Fifty\nof these students receive $1,500 each, and five of these (one from each region\nof California) are awarded an additional $1000 toward their college tuition.\n\nApproximately one thousand chapters are located in various secondary schools\nacross the state. The organization continues to promote the education of\nacademically motivated students, encouraging them to get involved in their\ncommunities through volunteer service.\n\nCSF also has a subdivision called the 'California Junior Scholarship Federation'\nwhich awards scholarships to middle school students.\n","linknr":85,"url":"California_Scholarship_Federation","recorded":1362673810,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["High school honor societies","Education in California","Organizations established in 1921"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/CaliforniaScholarshipFoundationLogo.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["California","Scholarship","Secondary_school"]}
