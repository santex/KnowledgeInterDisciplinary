When many stacked spectral channels\n(wavelengths) are collected for different locations of the microspectrometer\nfocus on a line or planar array in the focal plane, the data is called\nhyperspectral; fewer wavelength data sets are called multispectral. The data\nformat is called a hypercube. The data set may be visualized as a data cube, a\nthree-dimensional block of data spanning two spatial dimensions (x and y), with\na series of wavelengths (lambda) making up the third (spectral) axis. The\nhypercube can be visually and mathematically treated as a series of spectrally\nresolved images (each image plane corresponding to the image at one wavelength)\nor a series of spatially resolved spectra.\n\nMany materials, both manufactured and naturally occurring, derive their\nfunctionality from the spatial distribution of sample components. For example,\nextended release pharmaceutical formulations can be achieved by using a coating\nthat acts as a barrier layer. The release of active ingredient is controlled by\nthe presence of this barrier, and imperfections in the coating, such as\ndiscontinuities, may result in altered performance. In the semi-conductor\nindustry, irregularities or contaminants in silicon wafers or printed micro-\ncircuits can lead to failure of these components. The functionality of\nbiological systems is also dependent upon chemical gradients â a single cell,\ntissue, and even whole organs function because of the very specific arrangement\nof components. It has been shown that even small changes in chemical composition\nand distribution may be an early indicator of disease.\n\nAny material that depends on chemical gradients for functionality may be\namenable to study by an analytical technique that couples spatial and chemical\ncharacterization. To efficiently and effectively design and manufacture such\nmaterials, the âwhatâ and the âwhereâ must both be measured. The demand for this\ntype of analysis is increasing as manufactured materials become more complex.\nChemical imaging techniques is critical to understanding modern manufactured\nproducts and in some casses is a non-destructive technique so that samples are\npreserved for further testing.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Chemical_imaging","recorded":1362538583,"links":16,"instances":["electromagnetic_radiation","electromagnetic_radiation"],"pdf":["http://witec.de/en/download/Raman/ImagingMicroscopy04.pdf","http://www.spectroscopyeurope.com/NIR_14_3.pdf","http://www.spectroscopyeurope.com/NIR_14_3.pdf"],"categories":["Spectroscopy","Infrared imaging","Magnetic resonance imaging","Microscopy","Fluorescence techniques"],"headings":["History","Principles","Sampling and samples","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/HSI_LWIR_stones.png/300px-HSI_LWIR_stones.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/FIRST_measurement_of_SF6_and_NH3.jpg/300px-FIRST_measurement_of_SF6_and_NH3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","electromagnetic_radiation"],["emission","electromagnetic_radiation"],["emission","electromagnetic_radiation"],["emission","electromagnetic_radiation"]],"members":["emission","absorption"],"related":["Principal_component_analysis","Spectral_signature","Software","Chemometrics","Hyperspectral_imaging","Hyperspectral","Multispectral_imaging","Imaging_spectroscopy","Wavelength","Hypercube","Data_cube","Vibrational_spectroscopy","Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Transmittance","Scattering","Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Scattering","Spectrum","Hyperspectral_imaging","Hyperspectral_imaging","Imaging_spectrometer","Staring_array","Angular_resolution","Field_of_view","Infrared_spectroscopy","Raman_spectroscopy","Hyperspectral_imaging","Quartz","Feldspar","Hyperspectral_imaging","FT-IR","Attenuated_total_reflectance","Infrared_window","Hyperspectral_imaging","Raman_spectroscopy","Fluorescence","Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Chemometrics","Multispectral_image","Spectral_imaging","Imaging_spectroscopy","Hyperspectral_imaging","Thermal_infrared_spectroscopy"]}
