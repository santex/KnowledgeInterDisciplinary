It can also\noccur in both children and teenagers if either of their parents have Abdominal\nobesity. There is a strong correlation between central obesity and\ncardiovascular disease.

Visceral fat is composed of\nseveral adipose depots including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue\n(EWAT) and perirenal fat. An excess of visceral fat is known as central obesity,\nthe \"pot belly\" or \"beer belly\" effect, in which the abdomen protrudes\nexcessively. This body type is also known as \"apple shapedâ\" as opposed to \"pear\nshapedâ\" in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks. Scientists have\ncome to recognize that body fat, instead of body weight, is the key to\nevaluating obesity.\n\nResearchers first started to focus on abdominal obesity in the 1980s when they\nrealized that it had an important connection to cardiovascular disease,\ndiabetes, and dyslipidemia. Abdominal obesity was more closely related with\nmetabolic distractions connected with cardiovascular disease than was general\nobesity. In the late 1980s and early 1990s insightful and powerful imaging\ntechniques were discovered that would further help advance our understanding of\nthe health risks associated with body fat accumulation. Techniques such as\ncomputed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to dissect\nmass of adipose tissue located at the abdominal level into intra-abdominal fat\nand subcutaneous fat.\n","linknr":832,"url":"Central_obesity","recorded":1362485038,"links":43,"instances":["biophysical","mood","exercise","pharmacology","statistics","exercise"],"pdf":["http://redheracles.net/media/upload/research/pdf/17885722.pdf","http://www.gnmhealthcare.com/pdf/12-2009/22/ijo_vaop_ncurrent_gnm_ijo2009259a.pdf","http://www.gnmhealthcare.com/pdf/12-2009/22/ijo_vaop_ncurrent_gnm_ijo2009259a.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/109/3/433.pdf","http://elib.fda.moph.go.th/fulltext2/word/41633/41633.pdf","http://elib.fda.moph.go.th/fulltext2/word/41633/41633.pdf"],"categories":["Obesity","Medical
