Although fundraising typically\nrefers to efforts to gather money for non-profit organizations, it is sometimes\nused to refer to the identification and solicitation of investors or other\nsources of capital for-profit enterprises. Traditionally, fundraising consisted\nmostly of asking for donations on the street or at people's doors, and this is\nexperiencing very strong growth in the form of face-to-face fundraising, but new\nforms of fundraising such as online fundraising have emerged in recent years,\nthough these are often based on older methods such as grassroots fundraising.\n","title":"Fundraising","headings":["Organizations","Taxation","Types","Fundraiser events","Relationship building","Events","Capital campaigns","See also","Notes and references","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Grassroots_fundraising","3: Matching_gift","2: Crowd_funding","2: Non-profit_organization","2: Research","2: Political_campaign","2: Financial_endowment","2: Volunteer_grant","2: Better_The_World","2: Charitable_organization","2: United_Kingdom","1: Resources","1: Non-profit_organizations","1: Street_fundraiser","1: Religion","1: Philanthropy","1: Public_broadcasting","1: Environmental_issues","1: Student","1: Scholarship","1: Sports","1: Academics","1: Humanitarian","1: Disaster","1: Human_rights","1: Attorney_General#United_States","1: Evangelism","1: Proselytism","1: Barack_Obama","1: Fundraising_for_the_2008_United_States_presidential_election","1: Political_campaigns","1: Campaign_finance_reform","1: United_States","1: Political_action_committee","1: Political_party","1: 527_group","1: Pledge_drive","1: Internal_Revenue_Service","1: GuideStar","1: Investment","1: Family","1: Corporate_donations","1: Volunteer_grants","1: Benefit_concert","1: Walkathon","1: Fundraiser#Product_Fundraisers","1: Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA","1: Cookie","1: Impulse_buying","1: NSPCC","1: Pay_per_click","1: Save_the_Children","1: VDM_Verlag_Dr._Müller","1: Prospect_research","1: Crowdfunding","1: Media_event","1: Non-governmental_organization","1: Market_segmentation","1: Peter_Maple","1: Association_of_Donor_Relations_Professionals","1: Adrian_Sargeant","1: Live_Aid","1: Sport_Aid","1: Famine_relief","1: Ethiopia","1: Walk_Against_Want","1: Australia","1: Christian_Aid_Week","1: Ireland","1: If_Day","1: Canada","1: Real_property","1: Personal_property","1: Brick_and_mortar","1: American_Institute_of_Philanthropy","1: Comparison_of_online_charity_donation_services_in_the_United_Kingdom","1: Direct_mail_fundraising","1: Fondomat","1: Friendraising","1: FundRazr","1: Institute_of_Fundraising","1: Moneybomb","1: Street_fundraising","1: GiveForward.org","1: Harambee","1: Scott_Cutlip","1: Rutgers_University_Press"]}
