CASA differs from the\nfield of blind signal separation in that it is (at least to some extent) based\non the mechanisms of the human auditory system, and thus uses no more than two\nmicrophone recordings of an acoustic environment. It is related to the cocktail\nparty problem.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Computational_auditory_scene_analysis","recorded":1362673729,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hearing","Sound","Digital signal processing"],"headings":["Principles","System Architecture","Applications","See also","External links","Further reading","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Auditory_scene_analysis","Blind_signal_separation","Auditory_system","Cocktail_party_problem","Outer_ear","Ear_canal","Ear_drum","Cochlea","Basilar_membrane","Posterior_cingulate","Alzheimer's_disease","Filter_bank","Impulse_response","Gammatone_filter","Midbrain","Wiener_filter","Neural_network","Speech_recognition","Auditory_scene_analysis","Blind_signal_separation","Cocktail_party_problem","Machine_vision","Speech_recognition"]}
