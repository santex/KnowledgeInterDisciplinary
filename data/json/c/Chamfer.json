If the surfaces are at\nright angles, the chamfer will typically be symmetrical at 45 degrees. A fillet\nis the rounding off of an interior corner. A rounding of an exterior corner is\ncalled a \"round\" Madsen et al., \"Engineering Drawing and Design\" page 179.\nDelmar, 2004 ISBN 0-7668-1634-6 or a \"radius\".\n\n\"Chamfer\" is a term commonly used in mechanical and manufacturing engineering.\nSpecial tools such as chamfer mills and chamfer planes are available. In tile\nwork, or furniture such as counters or table tops, an edge or arris that has\nbeen eased by rounding instead of chamfering is called a bullnose. Where a\nchamfer does not go to the end of the piece, but \"lifts out\" in a smooth curve,\nthe end is called a lark's tongue''.\n\nAn example of chamfering is part of the process of hand-crafting a parabolic\nglass telescope mirror. Before the surface of the disc can be ground, the edges\nmust first be chamfered to prevent chipping. This can be accomplished by placing\nthe disc in a metal bowl containing silicon carbide and rotating the disc with a\nrocking motion. The grit will thus wear off the sharp edge of the glass.\n","linknr":285,"url":"Chamfer","recorded":1362551875,"links":37,"instances":["road","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic design","Electronic engineering","Metalworking terminology","Woodworking"],"headings":["Architecture","In printed circuit board (PCB) design","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Larks_tongue.JPG/220px-Larks_tongue.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Ponce_Chamfered_Street_Corner.jpg/220px-Ponce_Chamfered_Street_Corner.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/75/PCBChamfer.PNG/220px-PCBChamfer.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Blacksmith-hammer-anvil-50x50.png/30px-Blacksmith-hammer-anvil-50x50.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Smoothing_plane_drawing.png/30px-Smoothing_plane_drawing.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fillet","mechanics"],["curb","road"]],"members":["curb","fillet"],"related":["Bevel","Fillet_(mechanics)","Mechanical_engineering","Manufacturing_engineering","Chamfer_mill","Chamfer_plane","Arris","Bullnose","Silicon_carbide","Ponce,_Puerto_Rico","Taj_Mahal","Mausoleum","Agra","India","Cube","Octagon","Curb_(road)","Barcelona,_Spain","Ponce,_Puerto_Rico","Printed_circuit_board","Bevel","Taper","Radius_Edge"]}
