{"cursor":"57683","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'circadian rhythm' () is any biological process that displays an endogenous,\nentrainable oscillation of about 24 hours. These rhythms are driven by a\ncircadian clock, and rhythms have been widely observed in plants, animals, fungi\nand cyanobacteria. The term circadian comes from the Latin [[circa]], meaning\n\"around\" (or \"approximately\"), and diem or dies, meaning \"day\". The formal study\nof biological temporal rhythms, such as daily, tidal, weekly, seasonal, and\nannual rhythms, is called chronobiology. Although circadian rhythms are\nendogenous (\"built-in\", self-sustained), they are adjusted (entrained) to the\nlocal environment by external cues called zeitgebers, commonly the most\nimportant of which is daylight.\n","linknr":844,"url":"Circadian_rhythm","recorded":1362555562,"links":55,"instances":["butterfly","gene","physical","biology","chronobiology"],"pdf":["http://www.enlighter.org/images/2009/01/healthyLighting.pdf","http://www.enlighter.org/images/2009/01/healthyLighting.pdf"],"categories":["Sleep","Circadian rhythm|","Biology of bipolar disorder"],"headings":["History","Criteria","Origin","Importance in animals","In plants","Biological clock in mammals","Light and the biological clock","Enforced longer cycles","Human health","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Biological_clock_human.svg/400px-Biological_clock_human.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/PLANTCIRC.jpg/220px-PLANTCIRC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Circadian_rhythm_labeled.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Day_Sleepers_crop.jpg/220px-Day_Sleepers_crop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Light_Ethology.svg/150px-Light_Ethology.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["entrainment","chronobiology"],["period","gene"],["entrainment","chronobiology"],["period","gene"],["monarch","butterfly"],["cell","biology"],["fatigue","physical"],["fatigue","physical"]],"members":["monarch","period","fatigue","cell","entrainment"],"related":["Endogeny","Entrainment_(chronobiology)","Circadian_clock","Plants","Animals","Fungi","Cyanobacteria","Latin","Tidal","Chronobiology","Zeitgeber","Daylight","Androsthenes_of_Thasos","Alexander_the_Great","Diurnality","Tamarind","Circadian_clock","Jean-Jacques_d'Ortous_de_Mairan","Ron_Konopka","Seymour_Benzer","Period_(gene)","Joseph_Takahashi","CLOCK","Franz_Halberg","Entrainment_(chronobiology)","Time_zone","Jet_lag","Chemical_kinetics","Ultraviolet","Circadian_oscillator","Cyanobacteria","Adenosine_triphosphate","Prokaryotic","Period_(gene)","Familial_advanced_sleep_phase_syndrome","Human_eye","Neural_oscillation","Hormone","Photoperiodism","Free-running_sleep","Endogenous","Blind_mole_rat","Ultradian","Human_spaceflight","University_of_Tromsø","Rock_Ptarmigan","Reindeer","70th_parallel_north","78th_parallel_north","Ground_squirrel","Porcupine","Monarch_(butterfly)","Cryptochrome","Suprachiasmatic_nucleus","Mammal","Suprachiasmatic_nucleus","Cell_(biology)","Hypothalamus","Retina","Photoreceptor_cell","Rod_cell","Cone_cell","Photosensitive_ganglion_cell","Melanopsin","Retinohypothalamic_tract","Pineal_gland","Pine_cone","Epithalamus","Melatonin","Mars","Chronotype","Melatonin","Pineal_gland","Cortisol","Chronotype","Metabolite","Metabolite","Oesophagus","Lungs","Liver","Pancreas","Spleen","Thymus","Phase_response_curve","Illuminance","Nocturnality","Lux","Melanopsin","Nathaniel_Kleitman","Derk-Jan_Dijk","Charles_Czeisler","Sleep_latency","Angiotensin_converting_enzyme_inhibitors","Left_ventricular","Power-nap","Seasonal_affective_disorder","Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome","Circadian_rhythm_disorder","Reticular_activating_system","Uremia","Azotemia","Acute_renal_failure","Light_effects_on_circadian_rhythm","Obesity","Diabetes","Shift-work","Jet-lag","Clock","Rev-ErbA_alpha","Sleep","Rapid_eye_movement_sleep","Non-rapid_eye_movement_sleep","Fatigue_(physical)","NTSB","Jet_lag","Fatigue_(physical)","Insomnia","Bipolar_disorder","Sleep_disorder","Bipolar_disorder","Lithium_pharmacology","Sodium-vapor_lamp","Suprachiasmatic_nucleus","Cocaine","Actigraphy","ARNTL","ARNTL2","Bacterial_circadian_rhythms","Circaseptan","Circadian_rhythm_sleep_disorders","Circadian_oscillator","Circasemidian_rhythm","Cryptochrome","CRY1","CRY2","Delayed_sleep_phase_syndrome","Diurnal_cycle","Light_effects_on_circadian_rhythm","Light_in_school_buildings","Melatonin","PER1","PER2","PER3","Photosensitive_ganglion_cell","Polyphasic_sleep","Rev-ErbA_alpha","Segmented_sleep","Sleep_architecture"]}
