The pink color of\nwild flamingos is due to Î²-carotene they absorb from the blue-green algae in\ntheir diet. If fed a carotene-free diet they become white.]]\n\nThe term 'carotene' (also 'carotin', from the Latin carota, or\ncarrot Mosbyâs Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth\nEdition, Mosby-Year Book 1994, p. 273 ) is used for several related\nunsaturated hydrocarbon substances having the formula\nC 40 Hx , which are synthesized by plants but cannot be made\nby animals. Carotene is an orange photosynthetic pigment important for\nphotosynthesis. Carotenes are all colored to the human eye. They are responsible\nfor the orange color of the carrot, for which this class of chemicals is named,\nand for the colors of many other fruits and vegetables (for example, sweet\npotatoes and orange cantaloupe melon). Carotenes are also responsible for the\norange (but not all of the yellow) colors in dry foliage. They also (in lower\nconcentrations) impart the yellow coloration to milk-fat and butter. Omnivorous\nanimal species which are relatively poor converters of colored dietary\ncarotenoids to colorless retinoids have yellowed-colored body fat, as a result\nof the carotenoid retention from the vegetable portion of their diet. The\ntypical yellow-colored fat of humans and chickens is a result of fat storage of\ncarotenes from their diets.\n\nCarotenes contribute to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy they\nabsorb from chlorophyll. They also protect plant tissues by helping to absorb\nthe energy from singlet oxygen, an excited form of the oxygen molecule\nO 2 which is formed during photosynthesis.\n\nÎ²-Carotene is composed of two retinyl groups, and is broken down in the mucosa\nof the human small intestine by Î²-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase to retinal, a\nform of vitamin A. Î²-Carotene can be stored in the liver and body fat and\nconverted to retinal as needed, thus making it a form of vitamin A for humans\nand some other mammals. The carotenes Î±-carotene and Î³-carotene, due to their\nsingle retinyl group (Î²-ionone ring), also have some vitamin A activity (though\nless than Î²-carotene), as does the xanthophyll carotenoid Î²-cryptoxanthin. All\nother carotenoids, including lycopene, have no beta-ring and thus 'no' vitamin A\nactivity (although they may have antioxidant activity and thus biological\nactivity in other ways).\n\nAnimal species differ greatly in their ability to convert retinyl (beta-ionone)\ncontaining carotenoids to retinals. Carnivores in general are poor converters of\ndietary ionine-containing carotenoids. Pure carnivores such as ferets lack Î²-\ncarotene 15,15'-monooxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinals at\nall (resulting in carotenes 'not' being a form of vitamin A for this species);\nwhile cats can convert a trace of Î²-carotene to retinol, although the amount is\ntotally insufficient for meeting their daily retinol needs.\n","linknr":582,"url":"Carotene","recorded":1362482702,"links":63,"instances":["chemistry","colour","company"],"pdf":["http://pubman.nims.go.jp/pubman/item/escidoc:1587358:1/component/escidoc:1587358/Prb155420.pdf","http://pubman.nims.go.jp/pubman/item/escidoc:1587358:1/component/escidoc:1587358/Prb155420.pdf"],"categories":["Vitamins","Food colorings","Carotenoids","Hydrocarbons"],"headings":["Molecular structure","Dietary sources","The multiple forms","β-Carotene and cancer","β-Carotene and cognition","β-Carotene and photosensitivity","β-Carotene and nanotechnology","α-Carotene and risk of death","Carotenemia","Production","Nomenclature","Food additive","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/BetaCarotene-3d.png/350px-BetaCarotene-3d.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/CarrotDiversityLg.jpg/250px-CarrotDiversityLg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Lesser-flamingos.jpg/250px-Lesser-flamingos.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Alpha-carotene.svg/200px-Alpha-carotene.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Beta-Carotin.svg/200px-Beta-Carotin.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Gamma-carotene.svg/200px-Gamma-carotene.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Delta-carotene.svg/200px-Delta-carotene.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Wittig-9.svg/500px-Wittig-9.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["orange","color"],["orange","colour"],["dsm","company"],["precursor","chemistry"]],"members":["precursor","orange","dsm"],"related":["Tanzania","Unsaturated_hydrocarbon","Orange_(color)","Photosynthetic_pigment","Photosynthesis","Carrot","Sweet_potato","Cantaloupe","Chlorophyll","Singlet_oxygen","Beta-Carotene","Retinol","Mucosa","Small_intestine","Β-carotene_15,15'-monooxygenase","Retinal","Vitamin_A","Liver","Vitamin_A","Alpha-Carotene","Gamma-Carotene","Ionone","Xanthophyll","Cryptoxanthin","Lycopene","Ionone","Β-carotene_15,15'-monooxygenase","Hydrocarbon","Conjugated_double_bond","Tetraterpene","Terpene","Isoprene","Greek_alphabet","Alpha-Carotene","Beta-Carotene","Gamma-Carotene","Delta-Carotene","Epsilon-Carotene","Zeta-Carotene","Carotenoid","Xanthophyll","Vitamin_A","Sweet_potato","Carrot","Wolfberry","Cantaloupe_melon","United_States_Department_of_Agriculture","Mango","Apricot","Persimmon","Spinach","Kale","Chard","Turnip_greens","Dandelion_greens","Beet_greens","Mustard_greens","Collard_greens","Watercress","Cilantro","Thyme","Broccoli","Parsley","Romaine_lettuce","Ivy_gourd","Rose_hip","Winter_squash","Pumpkin","Cassava","Cell_wall","International_unit","Isomer","Double_bond","Beta-Carotene","Yellow","Orange_(colour)","Green","Fruit","Vegetable","Rule_of_thumb","Antioxidant","Reference_Daily_Intake","Smoker","Asbestos","American_Cancer_Society","The_Cancer_Research_Campaign","The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Vitamin_E","National_Cancer_Institute","Retinyl_palmitate","Tobacco_smoking","Asbestos","Cochrane_Collaboration","Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Association","Philip_Taylor","Sanford_Dawsey","Erythropoietic_protoporphyria","Lycopene","Carbon_nanotube","Optical_properties_of_carbon_nanotubes","Alpha-Carotene","Conjunctiva","Jaundice","Carrot","Medical_sign","Freeport,_Texas","DSM_(company)","BASF","Vitatene","Blakeslea_trispora","Aquacarotene_Limited","Karratha,_Western_Australia","Cognis","Portugal","Industrial_biotechnology","Biotrend","Guernsey","Total_synthesis","BASF","Wittig_reaction","Grignard_reaction","Hoffman-La_Roche","Carotenoid","Xanthophyll","Lycopene","Biosynthesis","Precursor_(chemistry)","Neurosporene","Antioxidant","University_of_Bristol"]}
