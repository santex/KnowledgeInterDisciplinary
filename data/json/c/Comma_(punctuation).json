It\nhas the same shape as an apostrophe or single closing quotation mark in many\ntypefaces, but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text.\nSome typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight but\ninclined from the vertical, or with the appearance of a small, filled-in number\n9. It is used to separate parts of a sentence such as clauses and lists of three\nor more things.\n\nThe comma is used in many contexts and languages, principally for separating\nthings. According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the word comma comes\ndirectly from the Greek komma (ÎºÏÎ¼Î¼Î±), which means something cut off or a short\nclause. A comma can also be used as a diacritic when combined with other\ncharacters.\n","linknr":496,"url":"Comma_(punctuation)","recorded":1362374591,"links":66,"instances":["linguistics","typography","computing","punctuation","punctuation","computer_science","programming_language","programming","rhetoric","1941","process","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2006S/lat101/handouts/no_spaces_aeneid.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/publish/sp7084.pdf"],"categories":["Punctuation","Alphabetic diacritics"],"headings":["Comma variants","History","Uses in English","In other languages","Computing","Diacritical usage","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sentence","linguistics"],["reading","process"],["slash","punctuation"],["colon","punctuation"],["parenthesis","rhetoric"],["colon","punctuation"],["raid_on_alexandria","1941"],["character","computing"],["c","programming_language"],["parameter","computer_science"],["statement","programming"],["macro","computer_science"],["ascender","typography"]],"members":["sentence","ascender","character","slash","colon","parameter","c","statement","parenthesis","raid_on_alexandria","reading","macro"],"related":["Ideographic","Arabic_script","Diacritic","Punctuation","Apostrophe","Quotation_mark","Typeface","Sentence_(linguistics)","Clause","Greek_language","Diacritic","Decimal_separator","Continental_Europe","Brazil","ʻOkina","Cedilla","Aristophanes_of_Byzantium","Interpunct","Reading_(process)","Slash_(punctuation)","Aldus_Manutius","Haverford_College","Palaeography","Grammar","English_language","Grammatical_conjunction","Serial_comma","Oxford_University_Press","Harvard_University_Press","Rule_of_thumb","Semicolon","Colon_(punctuation)","Clause","Dependent_clause","Independent_clause","Relative_clause","Restrictiveness","Independent_clause","Grammatical_conjunction","Imperative_mood","German_language","Polish_language","Comma_splice","Asyndeton","Adverbs","Parenthesis_(rhetoric)","Apposition","Colon_(punctuation)","Raid_on_Alexandria_(1941)","United_States_Postal_Service","Royal_Mail","Full_stop","Decimal_mark","Lynne_Truss","Quotation_mark","American_English","The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style","British_English","Serial_comma","American_English","Robert_J._Samuelson","Lynne_Truss","Full_stop","Japanese_punctuation","Chinese_punctuation","Arabic","Urdu","Persian_language","Hebrew","Korean_punctuation","Interpunct","Character_(computing)","Unicode","ASCII","Hexadecimal","HTML","Numeric_character_reference","Subroutine","Array_data_type","C_(programming_language)","Comma_operator","Parameter_(computer_science)","Statement_(programming)","Macro_(computer_science)","Smalltalk","Concatenation","Comma-separated_values","Romance_languages","Diacritic","Romanian_language","Cedilla","Unicode","D-comma","Romanian_alphabet","Cyrillic_script","Latvian_language","Palatalization","Descender","Adobe_Systems","Glyph","Unicode","Cedilla","Unicode","Czech_language","Slovak_language","Caron","Ascender_(typography)","Finnish_Kalo_language","Lakota_language","Skolt_Sami_language","Cedilla","Ogonek","Semicolon","Serial_comma","Decimal_separator"]}
