It is analogous to proton NMR ( NMR) and allows the identification of\ncarbon atoms in an organic molecule just as proton NMR identifies hydrogen\natoms. As such 13 C NMR is an important tool in chemical structure\nelucidation in organic chemistry. 13 C NMR detects only the isotope of\ncarbon, whose natural abundance is only 1.1%, because the main carbon isotope, ,\nis not detectable by NMR since it has zero net spin.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Carbon-13_NMR","recorded":1362544402,"links":17,"instances":["physics","nmr"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear magnetic resonance","Carbon"],"headings":["Implementation","DEPT spectra","APT spectra","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/a8ef43b7d3663cf99c32e41f5f9e8a87.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/DEPT_spectra.jpg/300px-DEPT_spectra.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin","physics"],["spin","physics"],["spin","physics"],["relaxation","nmr"]],"members":["spin","relaxation"],"related":["NMR_spectroscopy","Carbon","Proton_NMR","Atom","Organic_molecule","Hydrogen","Chemical_structure","Organic_chemistry","Isotope","Natural_abundance","Spin_(physics)","Spin_(physics)","Protein","Gyromagnetic_ratio","J-coupling","NMR_decoupling","Spin_(physics)","Relaxation_(NMR)","Drug","Polymers","Chemical_shift","Tetramethylsilane","Tertiary_carbon","Nuclear_Overhauser_effect","Hydrogen","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Ethyl_group","Ester","Phthalic_acids"]}
