The species that infects humans is\ncommonly known as human CMV (HCMV) or human herpesvirus-5 (HHV-5), and is the\nmost studied of all cytomegaloviruses. Within\n[[Herpesviridae]], CMV belongs to the [[Betaherpesvirinae]] subfamily, which\nalso includes the genera [[Muromegalovirus]] and [[Roseolovirus|Roseolovirus\n(HHV-6 and HHV-7)]]. It is related to\nother herpesviruses within the subfamilies of [[Alphaherpesvirinae]] that\nincludes herpes simplex viruses (HSV)-1 and -2 and varicella-zoster virus\n(VZV), and the [[Gammaherpesvirinae]] subfamily that includes EpsteinâBarr\nvirus. All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability\nto remain latent within the body over long periods. Although they may be found\nthroughout the body, CMV infections are frequently associated with the\nsalivary glands in humans and other mammals.\nOther CMV viruses are found in several mammal species, but species isolated\nfrom animals differ from HCMV in terms of genomic structure, and have not been\nreported to cause human disease.\n","linknr":456,"url":"Cytomegalovirus_infection","recorded":1362482130,"links":48,"instances":["human_cytomegalovirus"],"pdf":["http://download.cell.com/pdf/PIIS0092867400810545.pdf","http://download.cell.com/pdf/PIIS0092867400810545.pdf","http://www.immunityageing.com/content/pdf/1742-4933-6-10.pdf","http://www.immunityageing.com/content/pdf/1742-4933-6-10.pdf"],"categories":["Viral diseases","Herpesviruses","Virus-related cutaneous conditions"],"headings":["Species","HCMV","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Cytomegalovirus_01.jpg/220px-Cytomegalovirus_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hcmv","human_cytomegalovirus"]],"members":["hcmv"],"related":["Inclusion_bodies","Pneumocyte","Greek_language","Virus","Genus","Species","HCMV_(human_cytomegalovirus)","Herpes_simplex_virus","Varicella-zoster_virus","Epstein–Barr_virus","Virus_latency","Salivary_gland","Mammal","Mammal","Species","Human","African_green_monkey","Rhesus_monkey","Chimpanzee","Orangutan","Night_monkey","Mammal","Chimpanzee","Orangutan","Macaque","Night_monkey","Rat","Primate","Rodent","Species","Virus","Salivary_gland","Immunocompromised","HIV","Organ_transplant","Neonate","Hydrops_fetalis","Virus_latency","United_States","Antibodies","Seroprevalence","Infection","Developed_countries","TORCH_complex","National_Vaccine_Program_Office"]}
