A\nchain may consist of two or more links.\n\nChains are usually made in one of two styles, according to their intended use:\n* Those designed for lifting, such as when used with a hoist; for pulling; or\n  for securing, such as with a bicycle lock, have links that are torus shaped,\n  which make the chain flexible in two dimensions (The fixed third dimension\n  being a chain's length.)\n* Those designed for transferring power in machines have links designed to mesh\n  with the teeth of the sprockets of the machine, and are flexible in only one\n  dimension. They are known as roller chains, though there are also non-roller\n  chains such as block chain.\n\nTwo distinct chains can be connected using a quick link which resembles a\ncarabiner with a screw close rather than a latch.\n",
