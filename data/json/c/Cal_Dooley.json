Dooley earned\nhis bachelor's degree in agricultural economics from the University of\nCalifornia, Davis in 1977 and a master's degree in Management from Stanford\nUniversity in 1987. Dooley worked as a rancher and then as an administrative\nassistant for California State Senator Rose Ann Vuich from 1987 to 1990.\n\nIn mid-1990, Dooley won the Democratic primary for what was then the 17th\nDistrict and faced six-term Republican Chip Pashayan in November. Although\nPashayan had been reelected with 71 percent of the vote in 1988, he was bogged\ndown by the House banking scandal, and Dooley defeated him by just over 9\npoints. In 1992, his district was renumbered as the 20th District and drawn as a\nLatino-majority district. He was easily reelected that year and five more times\nafter that. He faced only one truly serious contest, when Republican Rich\nRodriguez managed to hold him to 53 percent of the vote. A \"New Democrat,\" his\nvoting record was considered moderate, as is typical for Democrats from the\nCentral Valley.\n\nDooley announced his retirement in 2004 and endorsed his Chief of Staff, Lisa\nQuigley, as his successor. However, most of the rest of the state Democratic\nestablishment endorsed Jim Costa, a former state legislator from the Fresno\narea. This touched off a contentious primary battle which was won by Costa, all\nbut assuring him of victory in November. On October 10, 2002, Cal Dooley was\namong the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of\nIraq. He has later said that he regrets this vote.\n\nAs of September, 2008, Dooley assumed the position of CEO of the American\nChemistry Council, the trade association for American chemical companies.\nPreviously, having served as the President and CEO of the Food Products\nAssociation (FPA), Dooley assumed the same roles at the Grocery Manufacturers\nAssociation (GMA), following a merger with the FPA. GMA is a Washington-based\ntrade association representing food manufacturers.\n\nDooley is married to the former Linda Phillips, who heads the Bryce Harlow\nFoundation in Washington DC. The couple has two daughters, Brooke Ybarra, who\nworks for the federal government, and Emily Dooley, a social studies teacher at\nMonticello High School in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Cal_Dooley","recorded":1362892239,"links":14,"instances":["united_states","california","virginia","united_states","chip_pashayan"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Members of the United States House of Representatives from California","American chief executives","American lobbyists","California Democrats","People from Visalia, California","1954 births","Living people"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Caldooley.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["charles","chip_pashayan"],["democratic_party","united_states"],["democratic_party","united_states"],["republican_party","united_states"],["central_valley","california"],["monticello_high_school","virginia"],["charles","chip_pashayan"]],"members":["republican_party","central_valley","monticello_high_school","democratic_party","charles"],"related":["Visalia,_California","California","California's_17th_congressional_district","California's_20th_congressional_district","Charles_(Chip)_Pashayan","Jim_Costa","Democratic_Party_(United_States)","University_of_California,_Davis","United_States","Democratic_Party_(United_States)","United_States_House_of_Representatives","California","Visalia,_California","Hanford,_California","University_of_California,_Davis","Stanford_University","California_State_Senate","Rose_Ann_Vuich","Republican_Party_(United_States)","Chip_Pashayan","House_banking_scandal","New_Democrats","Central_Valley_(California)","Jim_Costa","2003_invasion_of_Iraq","American_Chemistry_Council","Food_Products_Association","Grocery_Manufacturers_Association","Monticello_High_School_(Virginia)","Charlottesville,_Virginia","Virginia","Charles_(Chip)_Pashayan","Leon_Panetta","Bill_Thomas","Jim_Costa","Visalia,_California"]}
