Most\ndefinitions of the term specify that automobiles are designed to run primarily\non roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four\nwheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather\nthan goods.<ref></ref>\n\nThe year 1886 is regarded the year of birth of the modern automobile - with the\nBenz Patent-Motorwagen, by German inventor Carl Benz. Motorized wagons soon\nreplaced animal-drafted carriages, especially after automobiles became\naffordable for many people when the Ford Model T was introduced in 1908.\n\nThe term motorcar has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail\nsystems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides\nspace for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on\nsuburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.<ref></ref>\n\nIt was estimated in 2010 that the number of automobiles had risen to over 1\nbillion vehicles, up from the 500 million of 1986.<ref></ref> The numbers are\nincreasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other NICs.<ref\nname=\"plunkettresearch.com\">Plunkett Research,
