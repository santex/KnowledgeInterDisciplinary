{"cursor":"4878","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is certainly a real thing, but it is a construct (not another object)]] A\n 'construct' in the philosophy of science is an ideal object, where the\n existence of the thing may be said to depend upon a subject's mind. This, as\n opposed to a \"real\" object, where existence does not seem to depend on the\n existence of a mind. Bunge, M. 1974. Treatise on Basic Philosophy, Vol. I\n Semantics I: Sense and Reference. Dordrecth-Boston: Reidel Publishing Co.\n\nIn a scientific theory, particularly within psychology, a hypothetical construct\nis an explanatory variable which is not directly observable. For example, the\nconcepts of intelligence and motivation are used to explain phenomena in\npsychology, but neither is directly observable. A hypothetical construct differs\nfrom an intervening variable in that it has properties and implications which\nhave not been demonstrated in empirical research. These serve as a guide to\nfurther research. An intervening variable, on the other hand, is a summary of\nobserved empirical findings.\n\nThe creation of constructs is a part of operationalization, especially the\ncreation of theoretical definitions. The usefulness of one conceptualization\nover another depends largely on construct validity.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Construct_(philosophy_of_science)","recorded":1362676284,"links":25,"instances":["philosophy","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific method","Philosophical concepts","Philosophy of science"],"headings":["Construct versus object","Other Examples of Constructs","History","Sources","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Bobo_doll-en.svg/140px-Bobo_doll-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Symptoms_of_leukemia.png/220px-Symptoms_of_leukemia.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["object","philosophy"],["object","philosophy"],["mood","psychology"]],"members":["object","mood"],"related":["Philosophy_of_science","Object_(philosophy)","Mind","Scientific_theory","Psychology","Intervening_variable","Operationalization","Theoretical_definition","Construct_validity","Concept","Hypotheses","Theories","Evolutionary_theory","Gravitational_theory","Taxonomy","Object_(philosophy)","Lawyers","Silver_fish","Undershirts","Biology","Genes","Evolution","Illness","Taxonomy","Physics","Astrophysics","Black_holes","Big_Bang","Dark_Matter","String_Theory","Molecular_physics","Atoms","Gravity","Center_of_mass","Psychology","Intelligence","Knowledge","Emotions","Personality","Mood_(psychology)","Theories","Hypotheses","Operational_definition"]}
