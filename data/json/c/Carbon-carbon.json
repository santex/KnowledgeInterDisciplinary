{"cursor":"5465","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", [http://www.swri.org/3pubs/ttoday/fall03/LeadingEdge.htm On the Leading\nEdge] showing brittle failure of 'C/C' due to foam impact reproducing a\npossible event during ''Columbia'''s final launch.]] 'Carbon fibre-reinforced\ncarbon' (aka 'carbonâcarbon', abbreviated 'C/C') is a composite material\nconsisting of carbon fiber reinforcement in a matrix of graphite. It was\ndeveloped for the nose cones of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and is most\nwidely known as the material for the nose cone and wing leading edges of the\nSpace Shuttle orbiter. It has been used in the brake systems of Formula One\nracing cars since 1976; carbonâcarbon brake discs and pads are a standard\ncomponent of Formula One brake systems.\n\nCarbonâcarbon is well-suited to structural applications at high temperatures, or\nwhere thermal shock resistance and/or a low coefficient of thermal expansion is\nneeded. While it is less brittle than many other ceramics, it lacks impact\nresistance; Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' was destroyed during atmospheric reentry\nafter one of its RCC panels was broken by the impact of a piece of foam\ninsulation from the Space Shuttle External Tank. This catastrophic failure was\ndue in part to original shuttle design requirements which did not consider the\nlikelihood of such violent impacts.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Carbon-carbon","recorded":1362897506,"links":19,"instances":["road_car","material","fiber","fuel","resin","composite"],"pdf":["http://www.ias.ac.in/sadhana/Pdf2003Apr/Pe1069.pdf"],"categories":["Composite materials","Refractory materials"],"headings":["Production","Mechanical properties","Similar products","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Impact-test.jpg/240px-Impact-test.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Ferrari_F430_Challenge_Brake.JPG/240px-Ferrari_F430_Challenge_Brake.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["carbon","fiber"],["binder","material"],["pitch","resin"],["coke","fuel"],["aggregate","composite"],["audi_r8","road_car"]],"members":["audi_r8","binder","carbon","coke","pitch","aggregate"],"related":["Brittle","Failure_mode","Space_Shuttle_Columbia","Composite_material","Carbon_(fiber)","Graphite","Nose_cone","Intercontinental_ballistic_missiles","Leading_edge","Space_Shuttle_orbiter","Brake","Formula_One","Disc_brake","Thermal_shock","Coefficient_of_thermal_expansion","Brittle","Space_Shuttle_Columbia","Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster","Reentry","Space_Shuttle_External_Tank","Ferrari","Organic_compound","Binder_(material)","Plastic","Pitch_(resin)","Coke_(fuel)","Aggregate_(composite)","Pyrolysis","Acetylene","Heat_treatment","Graphite","Automotive_industry","Brake","Silicon_carbide","Carbon_fiber","Mercedes-Benz_C215","Bugatti_Veyron","Bentley","Ferrari","Porsche","Corvette_ZR1,_Z06","Lamborghini","Audi","Audi_S8","Audi_RS4","Audi_S6","Audi_RS6","Audi_R8_(road_car)","Carbotanium","Pagani","Bugatti_Veyron","Bentley_Brooklands"]}
