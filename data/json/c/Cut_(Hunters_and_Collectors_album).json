Produced by\nAmerican Don Gehman (R.E.M., John Mellencamp), it reached No. 6 on the\nAustralian album chart. The band was nominated for Best Group in the 1992 ARIA\nMusic Awards [http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=1992\nARIA Award winners, 1992] and for Album of the Year for Cut a year later. [http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-\nyear.php?year=1993 ARIA Award winners, 1993]\n\nSingles from the album were \"Head Above Water\", \"We The People\" and\n\"Holy Grail\".\n\nMark Seymour later said, \"We were working with an American producer named Don\nGehman, who was basically deconstructing the band's songwriting process and\nlooking for hits. It almost went wrong. It wasn't a happy time for us. The band\nalmost broke up over that - there was so much internal tension.\" {{cite book | author= Jeff Jenkins |title=50 Years of Rock in\nAustralia|year=2007|page=290 |publisher=Wilkinson Publishing |location=Melbourne\n|isbn=9781921332111}}\n","linknr":148,"url":"Cut_(Hunters_and_Collectors_album)","recorded":1362674411,"links":19,"instances":["musician","music","song","band","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1992 albums","Hunters & Collectors albums","Albums produced by Don Gehman"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","Credits","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Huntercut.jpg/220px-Huntercut.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg/32px-Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["r.e.m.","band"],["holy_grail","song"],["programming","music"],["barry_palmer","musician"],["jeremy_smith","musician"]],"members":["barry_palmer","programming","holy_grail","jeremy_smith"],"related":["Album","Hunters_&_Collectors","Australian_rock","Mushroom_Records","Don_Gehman","Allmusic","Australia","Rock_band","Hunters_&_Collectors","Don_Gehman","R.E.M._(band)","John_Mellencamp","ARIA_Music_Awards","Mark_Seymour","Don_Gehman","Mark_Seymour","Holy_Grail_(song)","Lead_vocals","Guitar","Bass_guitar","Drum_kit","Backing_vocals","Programming_(music)","Percussion","Tape_loops","Trumpet","Keyboard_instrument","Barry_Palmer_(musician)","Lead_guitar","Jeremy_Smith_(musician)","French_horn","Trombone","Don_Gehman","Nick_Sansano"]}
