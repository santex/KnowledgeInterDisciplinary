The effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the\n hairs of a paint-brush, in a thin tube, in porous materials such as paper, in\n some non-porous materials such as liquified carbon fiber, or in a cell. It\n occurs because of inter-molecular attractive forces between the liquid and\n solid surrounding surfaces. If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small,\n then the combination of surface tension (which is caused by cohesion within the\n liquid) and adhesive forces between the liquid and container act to lift the\n liquid. http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html\n","linknr":285,"url":"Capillary_action","recorded":1362482699,"links":58,"instances":["tool","element","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fluid dynamics","Hydrology"],"headings":["Etymology","Phenomena and physics of capillary action","Examples","Height of a meniscus","Liquid transport in porous media","Miscellaneous","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Capillarity.svg/220px-Capillarity.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Capillary_Flow_Experiment.jpg/220px-Capillary_Flow_Experiment.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/c/e0c9ff1c1ecd1aed695eb584f5402b2b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/0/8/208f9d14f34c6d28ef6486e22c792609.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/3/7e345f562542175a3758ddefc6a2690d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/a/3/ca326b45427eb5dd05b559970f3115d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Capillary_flow_brick.jpg/220px-Capillary_flow_brick.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/1/4/1142f6fce96c92473511aa33d772e30d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/9/2895fdd95ba6c2c61b96fb9d4a6e14e5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/9/e/39eb13b75abd9c9b973c2f74067a1d7f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg/220px-BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["cohesion","chemistry"],["sponge","tool"],["mercury","element"],["damp","structural#rising_dampness"]],"members":["sponge","mercury","cohesion","damp"],"related":["Mercury_(element)","Liquid","Gravitation","Surface_tension","Cohesion_(chemistry)","Adhesion","Phenomena","Meniscus","Adhesion","Gravitational_force","Tears","Eyelid","Nasolacrimal_duct","Paper_towel","Sponge_(tool)","Candle","Candle_wick","Thin_layer_chromatography","Mercury_(element)","Intermolecular_force","Hydrology","Groundwater","Water_potential","George_Batchelor","Surface_tension","Contact_angle","Density","Gravitational_field","Radius","Radian","Brick","Sorptivity","Porosity","Albert_Einstein","Annalen_der_Physik","Youngâ€“Laplace_equation","Capillary_pressure","Damp-proof_course","Capillary_fringe","Capillary_wave","Frost_flowers","Frost_heaving","Needle_ice","Washburn's_equation","Wick_effect","Bound_water","Surface_Tension","Hindu_milk_miracle"]}
