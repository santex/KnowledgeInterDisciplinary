Crasis occurs in Portuguese and Arabic as well as in\nAncient Greek, where it was first described.\n\nIn some cases, as in the French examples below, crasis involves the\ngrammaticalization of two individual lexical items into one, but in other cases,\nas in the Greek examples, crasis is the orthographic representation of the\nencliticization and vowel reduction of one grammatical form with another. The\ndifference between the two is that the Greek examples involve two grammatical\nwords and a single phonological word and the French examples involve a single\nphonological word and grammatical word.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Crasis","recorded":1362897207,"links":24,"instances":["linguistics","diacritic","french","linguistics","linguistics","letter","grammar"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phonology","Greek language","Portuguese language"],"headings":["Greek","French","Portuguese","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coalescence","linguistics"],["coronis","diacritic"],["rho","letter"],["compound","linguistics"],["assimilation","linguistics"],["contraction","grammar"],["liaison","french"]],"members":["coalescence","coronis","liaison","assimilation","compound","rho","contraction"],"related":["Synalepha","Coalescence_(linguistics)","Portuguese_language","Arabic_language","Grammatical_words","Phonological_word","Phonological_word","Grammatical_word","Ancient_Greek","Modern_Greek","Coronis_(diacritic)","Gemination","Rho_(letter)","Synaeresis","Compound_(linguistics)","Liturgy","Portuguese_language","Old_Portuguese","Grave_accent","Clitic","Demonstrative","Secondary_stress","Brazilian_Portuguese","Northeast_Region,_Brazil","Brazilian_Portuguese","European_Portuguese","Hacienda","Bahia","Assimilation_(linguistics)","Clitic","Contraction_(grammar)","Elision","Liaison_(French)","Sandhi","Synaeresis"]}
