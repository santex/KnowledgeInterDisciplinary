In 2006, SchÃ¤rfe System was\nacquired by Innovatis, a company focused on cell culture analysis. CASY utilizes\nthe techniques of electric current exclusion and pulse area analysis, the cells\ncan be analyzed and counted in an efficient and precise manner. This technology\ncan be applied for cell counting, cell culture analysis at a certain time\ninterval, or even a period of time.\n","linknr":96,"url":"CASY_cell_counting_technology","recorded":1362481327,"links":10,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Counting instruments"],"headings":["Principle of CASY technology","Advantages","Applications","Differences between CASY and Coulter cell counting","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Cell_culture","Cell_counting","Plasma_membrane","Electric_insulator","Electrolyte","Flow_cytometry","Trypan_blue","Propidium_iodide","MTT_assay","Coulter_counter"]}
