{"cursor":"45945","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cultivated plant taxonomy' is the study of the theory and practice of the\nscience that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigens—those\nplants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity.\nCultivated plant taxonomists do, however, work with all kinds of plants in\ncultivation.\n\nCultivated plant taxonomy is one part of the study of horticultural botany which\nis mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or\ngovernment departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant\ntaxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for\ncultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public\non matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants\nand carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated\nplants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases,\nherbaria and other information about cultivated plants.\n\nMuch of the work of the cultivated plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming\nof plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the\n[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (Botanical\nCode) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific\ncommunity, while those of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for\nCultivated Plants]] (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both\nscientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used\nin commerce â the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and\nhorticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but\nare added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among\nthe community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.\n\nThe history of cultivated plant taxonomy can be traced from the first plant\nselections that occurred during the agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first\nrecorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and\nclassification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until\nthe establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally\nestablished the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time\nthe classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path.\n","linknr":590,"url":"Cultivated_plant_taxonomy","recorded":1362372784,"links":31,"instances":["philosopher","botanist","horticulture","plant","botanist"],"pdf":["http://www.actahort.org/chronica/pdf/sh_10.pdf"],"categories":["Plant
