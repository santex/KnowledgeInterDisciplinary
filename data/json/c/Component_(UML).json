This idea is the underpinning for the plug-and-\nplay capability of component-based systems and promotes software reuse .\n\nAs can be seen from the above definition, UML places no restriction on the\ngranularity of a component. Thus, a component may be as small as a figures-to-\nwords converter, or as large as an entire [[document management system]].\n\nLarger pieces of a system's functionality may be assembled by reusing components\nas parts in an encompassing component or assembly of components, and wiring\ntogether their required and provided interfaces.\"\nSuch assemblies are illustrated by means of component diagrams.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Component_(UML)","recorded":1362476944,"links":19,"instances":["computer_science","uml"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Unified Modeling Language"],"headings":["Related terms","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Component.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Use_case_restaurant_model.svg/100px-Use_case_restaurant_model.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interface","computer_science"],["package","uml"]],"members":["interface","package"],"related":["Unified_Modeling_Language","Modular","System","Built_environment","Behavior","Interface_(computer_science)","Plug-and-play","Component-based","Software_reuse","System","Component_diagram","Package_(UML)"]}
