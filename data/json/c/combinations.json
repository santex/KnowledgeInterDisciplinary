In smaller\ncases it is possible to count the number of combinations. For example given\nthree fruit, say an apple, orange and pear, there are three combinations of two\nthat can be drawn from this set: an apple and a pear; an apple and an orange; or\na pear and an orange. More formally a k-'combination' of a set S is a subset of\nk distinct elements of S. If the set has n elements the number of k-combinations\nis equal to the binomial coefficient\n:<math> \\binom nk = \\frac{n(n-1)\\ldots(n-k+1)}{k(k-1)\\dots1},</math>\nwhich can be written using factorials as <math>\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</math>\nwhenever <math>k\\leq n</math>, and which is zero when <math>k>n</math>. The set\nof all k-combinations of a set S is sometimes denoted by <math>\\binom\nSk\\,</math>.\n\nCombinations can refer to the combination of n things taken k at a time without\nor with repetitions.<ref>Erwin Kreyszig, Advanced Engineering Mathematics, John\nWiley & Sons, INC, 1999</ref> In the above example repetitions were not\nallowed. If however it was possible to have two of any one kind of fruit there\nwould be 3 more combinations: one with two apples, one with two oranges, and\none with two pears.\n\nWith large sets, it becomes necessary to use more sophisticated mathematics to\nfind the number of combinations. For example, a poker hand can be described as a\n5-combination (k&nbsp;=&nbsp;5) of cards from a 52 card deck (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;52).\nThe 5 cards of the hand are all distinct, and the order of cards in the hand\ndoes not matter. There are 2,598,960 such combinations, and the chance of\ndrawing any one hand at random is&nbsp;1&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,598,960.\n\nKnuth gives a thorough treatment of this topic in The Art of Computer\nProgramming.<ref></ref>\n","title":"Combination","headings":["Number of ''k''-combinations","Number of combinations with repetition","Number of ''k''-combinations for all ''k''","Probability: sampling a random combination","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Binomial_coefficient","3: Pascal's_triangle","2: Factorial","2: Combinatorial_number_system","1: Mathematics","1: Permutations","1: Permutations_and_combinations#case_in","1: Binomial_formula","1: Multiplication","1: Numerator","1: Permutations_and_combinations#case_i","1: Denominator","1: Enumerate","1: Bijection","1: Binomial_coefficient#Sum_of_coefficients_row","1: Base_2","1: Subsets","1: Empty_set","1: Algorithms","1: Rejection_sampling","1: Combinatorics","1: List_of_permutation_topics","1: Multiset","1: Permutation","1: Probability","1: Subset"]}
