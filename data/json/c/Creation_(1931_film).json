It was about modern men encountering dinosaurs and\nother prehistoric animals on an island. The picture was scrapped by RKO studio\nhead David O. Selznick on the grounds of expense, and Merian C. Cooper, the\nstudio worker who recommended the film's cancellation, considered the\nstoryline to be boring, due to lack of action. The completed footage ran\ntwenty minutes in length, although approximately four minutes of footage is\nall that survives today. Cooper later used some of the miniatures and dinosaur\narmatures and O'Brien's stop-motion animation techniques for [[King Kong (1933\nfilm)|King Kong]].\n","linknr":178,"url":"Creation_(1931_film)","recorded":1362668265,"links":12,"instances":["narrative"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1931 films","Unfinished films","Black-and-white films","King Kong","Lost films","American films","1930s American animated films","English-language films","1931 animated films","Stop-motion animated films","Prehistoric fantasy films","Films based on works by Edgar Rice Burroughs","Films set on islands"],"headings":["Plot","Legacy","Influence on Kong","Characters in ''Creation''","Bestiary","See also","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plot","narrative"]],"members":["plot"],"related":["Unfinished_creative_work","Feature_film","Stop_motion","Animation","Willis_O'Brien","Dinosaur","Island","RKO","David_O._Selznick","Merian_C._Cooper","Plot_(narrative)","Footage","Stop-motion_animation","Rhinoceros","Sauropod","Special_effect","Edgar_Rice_Burroughs","Chimpanzee","Jaguar","Sailor","Merian_C._Cooper","Ann_Darrow","Dinosaur","Ralf_Harolde","Monkey","Jaguar","Cheetah","List_of_stop-motion_films","Orville_Goldner","George_E._Turner","Ballantine_Books"]}
