It lives close to the shorelines and sandy beaches of\nNorth America, hence the name sand tiger shark.<!--what?--> It also dwells in\nthe waters of Japan, Australia, and South Africa. Despite its fearsome\nappearance and strong swimming ability, it is a relatively placid and slow-\nmoving shark. This species has a sharp, pointy head, and a bulky body. The sand\ntiger's length can reach . They are grey with reddish-brown spots on their\nbacks. The sand tiger prefers to hunt close to shore, and shivers (groups) have\nbeen observed to hunt large schools of fish. Their diet consists of bony fish,\ncrustaceans, squid, and skates. Unlike other sharks, the sand tiger can gulp air\nfrom the surface, allowing it to be suspended in the water column with minimal\neffort. During pregnancy, the most developed embryo will feed upon its siblings,\na reproductive strategy known as intrauterine cannibalism. The sand tiger is\ncategorized as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\nRed List. It is the most widely kept shark in public aquariums owing to its\nlarge size and tolerance for captivity.\n",
