Being caught out is the most\n common method of dismissal at higher levels of competition. This method of\n dismissal is covered by Law 32 of the Laws of cricket which reads: [http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-32-\n caught,58,AR.html Laws of Cricket: Law 32 (Caught)]\n\nA batsman is out caught if a fielder catches the ball fully within the field of\nplay without it bouncing once the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove\nholding the bat. If a batsman could be given out caught or by any other method\nexcept [[bowled]], 'caught' takes precedence.\n\nThis means that the batsman cannot be out caught if:\n* The ball is called a no ball or dead ball.\n* The batsman does not hit the ball with his bat or the gloved hand\n  holding the bat.\n* The ball, having been hit, makes contact with the field before a fielder\n  catches the ball.\n* The ball does not remain under the control of the fielder.\n* The ball is hit and lands beyond the boundary; (six runs).\n* A fielder taking the catch makes contact with the boundary rope or the area\n  outside the boundary.\n* The ball hits a close in fielder on the helmet, and rebounds in the air\n  for a catch.\n\nIf a batsman is out caught, any runs scored off that delivery are voided. If the\ncatch is taken by the wicket-keeper, then informally it is known as a \"'caught\nbehind'\". A catch by the bowler is known as a \"'caught and bowled'\". This has\nnothing to do with the dismissal bowled but is rather a shorthand for saying the\ncatcher and bowler are the same player (the scorecard annotation is usually c.\nand b. or c&b followed by the bowler's name).\n\nIf the catch taken is pronounced or obvious, the players need not appeal to the\numpire; the batsman normally chooses to acknowledge the dismissal himself.\nHowever, in the event that the ball brushes the edge of the bat, or the catch is\ntaken very close to the ground, or the ball appears to have bounced off the\nbatsman's foot (so it has not touched the ground), or the ball appearing to come\noff the bat very close to the pitch surface (bump ball), or if the batsman is\nreluctant to accept that he has been dismissed, the fielding team has to appeal\nto the umpire for this decision.\n\nIf a batsman is caught, the bowler is credited with the batsman's wicket and the\ncatching fielder is credited for the dismissal. If the two batsmen cross each\nother, in attempting to take a run, before the catch was taken, the new incoming\nbatsman becomes the non-striker with the exception being when the wicket falling\nin the last ball of an over, when if the batsmen cross the new batsman will be\non strike.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Caught_(cricket)","recorded":1364213118,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Caught","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Caught_(cricket)&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Caught_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:In_the_air.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/In_the_air.jpg/250px-In_the_air.jpg","/wiki/File:In_the_air.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf,_Dunedin,_NZ,_2009.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf%2C_Dunedin%2C_NZ%2C_2009.jpg/250px-Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf%2C_Dunedin%2C_NZ%2C_2009.jpg","/wiki/File:Shane_Bond_catching_Mohammad_Yousuf,_Dunedin,_NZ,_2009.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Shane_Bond","/wiki/Mohammad_Yousuf_(cricketer)","/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)","/wiki/Batsman","/wiki/Sport","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Laws_of_cricket","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Bowled","/wiki/No_ball","/wiki/Dead_ball_(cricket)","/wiki/Cricket_bat","/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)","/wiki/Six_(cricket)","/wiki/Wicket-keeper","/wiki/Bowler_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowled","/wiki/Appeal_(cricket)","/wiki/Over_(cricket)","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/1999_Cricket_World_Cup","/wiki/South_African","/wiki/Herschelle_Gibbs","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Steve_Waugh","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-32-caught,58,AR.html","#cite_ref-2","http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151523.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65231.html","/wiki/Template:Methods_of_dismissal_in_cricket","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Methods_of_dismissal_in_cricket&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Methods_of_dismissal_in_cricket&action=edit","/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowled","/wiki/Handled_the_ball","/wiki/Hit_the_ball_twice","/wiki/Hit_wicket","/wiki/Leg_before_wicket","/wiki/Obstructing_the_field","/wiki/Run_out","/wiki/Stump_(cricket)#Manner_of_dismissing_a_batsman","/wiki/Timed_out","/wiki/Template:Cricket_statistics","/wiki/Template_talk:Cricket_statistics","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cricket_statistics&action=edit","/wiki/Cricket_statistics","/wiki/Batting_(cricket)","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Run_(cricket)","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/Century_(cricket)","/wiki/Strike_rate","/wiki/Not_out","/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)","/wiki/Over_(cricket)","/wiki/Run_(cricket)","/wiki/Wicket","/wiki/No_ball","/wiki/Wide_(cricket)","/wiki/Bowling_average","/wiki/Hat-trick#Cricket","/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)","/wiki/Leg_bye","/wiki/Wicket-keeper","/wiki/Stump_(cricket)","/wiki/Bye_(cricket)","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Caught&oldid=541168291","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Cricket_laws_and_regulations","/wiki/Category:Cricket_terminology","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_September_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Caught&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Caught","/wiki/Caught","/wiki/Talk:Caught","#","/wiki/Caught","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Caught&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/H
