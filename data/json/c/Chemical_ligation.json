{"cursor":"4083","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Chemical ligation' is a set of techniques used for creating long peptide or\nprotein chains. It is the second step of a convergent approach. First, smaller\npeptides containing 30-50 amino acids are prepared by conventional chemical\npeptide synthesis. Then, they are completely deprotected. Chemical ligation is\nthe technique of coupling these peptides by chemoselective reaction to give a\nunique reaction product, usually in aqueous solution. With several coupling\nsteps, proteins of up to 200-300 amino acids can be produced.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Chemical_ligation","recorded":1362371338,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/etc/medialib/docs/Sigma-Aldrich/Bulletin/al_chemfile_v8_n1.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical synthesis"],"headings":["Methods of chemical ligation","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Peptide","Protein","Convergent_synthesis","Amino_acid","Peptide_synthesis","Amino_acid","Native_chemical_ligation","Amide_bond","Cysteine","Intein","Recombinant_DNA","Thioester","Expressed_protein_ligation","Staudinger_reaction","Royal_Society_of_Chemistry"]}
