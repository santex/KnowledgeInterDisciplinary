(d. 989) was a legendary Taoist sage. In\nChinese, he is often respectfully referred to as \"Aged Ancestor Chen Tuan\" (é³æ¶èç¥\nChÃ©n TuÃ¡n LÇozÇ) and \"Ancestral Teacher Xiyi\" (å¸å¤·ç¥å¸« XÄ«yÃ­ ZÇshÄ«). Little is\ncertain about his life, including when and where he was born. He was born around\nthe end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period and the start of the Song\nDynasty, possibly in what is now Luyi in Henan Province.\n\nAccording to certain Taoist schools who claim him as a founder, he lived a\nsecluded life in the Nine Room Cave on Mount Wudang. Later at Mount Hua, one of\nthe five sacred mountains of China, he is said to have created the kung fu\nsystem Liuhebafa (\"Six Harmonies and Eight Methods\"). Along with this internal\nart, he is also said to be associated with a method of Qi (energy) cultivation\nknown today as Taiji ruler, sleeping meditation, a 24 Daoyin Qigong Method (er\nshi shi ssu shih tao yin fa) seated and standing exercises designed to prevent\ndiseases that occur during seasonal change.\n\nThe story goes that Chen Tuan had planned a career at the Imperial court, but\nflunked the state examination and became a hermit sage instead. He was also said\nto be conversant with the Confucian classics, history, and the theories of\nvarious schools of thought. In his legends he was said to be fond of taoist\nphilosophy, medical principles, astronomy and geography, and famous for his\npoems as well. Chen Tuan liked to study the I Ching, which he was unable to put\ndown. Chen Tuan, styled Tunan, titled himself Fuyao Zi (one soaring upward in\nthe high sky, like a roc in Nan Hua Jing written by Zhuangzi) born in Zhenyuan\nof Haozhou (Hao County of Anhui Province nowadays). As a Taoist master in the\nlate Tang Dynasty, Five Dynasties and early Northern Song Dynasty, Chen was\nastonishingly intelligent and erudite in his childhood. He travelled here and\nthere and dwelled in Wudang Mountain for two decades at the beginning. Later he\nlived a hermitâs life in Huashan at the First Year of Xiande Period of Later\nZhou Dynasty (one of the Five Dynasties).\n\nChen Tuan has a good command of primordial Yi learning, teaches River Chart and\nLuo River Book as well as Infinite and Taiji Charts. As a culminant figure of\nTaoist doctrines who pioneers the Confucian school of idealist philosophy of the\nSong and Ming Dynasties, he has a profound influence upon later generations. He\nis adept in practicing Taoist inner alchemy and often sleep meditation. Strange\nto say, it often takes several months for sleeping meditation practice; and as a\nresult was known as the \"Sleeping Immortal.\" Having rejected emperorâs orders\nand edicts, was still conferred the title of âMaster Xi Yi\" (Master of the\nInaudible and Invisible) by the Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty. During the\nfirst year of Duangong Period of the Emperor Taizong, Chen appointed his\ndisciples to cut a stone chamber in the Zhao Chao Valley (later renamed Xi Yi\nValley); then Chen Tuan presented a report to the imperial court in which he\nwrote the following note: âI will die soon. I am about to leave, nowadays Iâm\ntransformed in the Zhang Chao Valley at the foot of Lotus Peak on the 27th day\nof the tenth month of the lunar calendarâ. By the time he died when he cupped\nhis check in the hand his facial features still remained without a change.\n\nChen Tuan once told to his disciples: âI will visit Emei Mountain next year.â\nLater a secret agent saw him at Emei Mountain, only to find no trace of Chen\nTuan while he was looking for him. Many tales of Chen Tuan have been circulated\naround; for instance: \"He wanders around and shows no concern for worldy\nbenefits. However, Chen still cares about the ordinary people and is\ncompassionate so that he is deeply respected by the people. This Taoist sage was\nconsidered the embodiment of the Supreme Lord Lao and received the nickname of\nâAged Ancestorâ, a symbol of Taoism in Huashan.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Chen_Tuan","recorded":1375066202,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Chen_Tuan_1797.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Chen_Tuan_1797.jpg","/wiki/Chinese_surname","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%99%B3","/wiki/Chinese_given_name","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%91%B6","/wiki/Chinese_style_name","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%9C%96","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8D%97","/wiki/Luyi_County","/wiki/Henan","#cite_note-ss457-1","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%99%B3","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B8%8C","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A4%B7","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%89%B6","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%90%96","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AD%90","/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%99%B3","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%91%B6","/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%99%88","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%8A%9F","/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese","/wiki/Pinyin","/wiki/Wade%E2%80%93Giles","/wiki/Yue_Chinese","/wiki/Jyutping","/wiki/Yale_Romanization#Cantonese","/wiki/Category:Taoism","/wiki/Taoism","/wiki/File:Yin_and_Yang.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Yin_and_Yang.svg/75px-Yin_and_Yang.svg.png","/wiki/Tao","/wiki/De_(Chinese)","/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy)","/wiki/Taiji_(philosophy)","/wiki/Yin_and_yang","/wiki/Wu_wei","/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)","/wiki/Wu_Xing","/wiki/Qi","/wiki/Three_Treasures_(Taoism)","/wiki/Daoist_meditation","/wiki/Taoist_diet","/wiki/Neidan","/wiki/Taoist_sexual_practices","/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching","/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)","/wiki/Liezi","/wiki/Daozang","/wiki/Three_Pure_Ones","/wiki/Guan_Yu","/wiki/Eight_Immortals","/wiki/Yellow_Emperor","/wiki/Li_Hong_(Taoist_eschatology)","/wiki/Queen_Mother_of_the_West","/wiki/Jade_Emperor","/wiki/Chang%27e","/wiki/Category:Chinese_deities","/wiki/List_of_Taoists","/wiki/Laozi","/wiki/Zhuangzi","/wiki/Zhang_Daoling","/wiki/Zhang_Jue","/wiki/Ge_Hong","/wiki/Way_of_the_Five_Pecks_of_Rice","/wiki/Way_of_the_Celestial_Masters","/wiki/Shangqing_School","/wiki/Lingbao_School","/wiki/Quanzhen_School","/wiki/Dragon_Gate_Taoism","/wiki/Zhengyi_Dao","/wiki/Wuliupai","/wiki/Grotto-heavens","/wiki/Mount_Penglai","/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion","/wiki/Chinese_Taoist_Association","/wiki/List_of_Celestial_Masters","/wiki/Daoshi","/wiki/Portal:Taoism","/wiki/Template:Taoism","/wiki/Template_talk:Taoism","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Taoism&action=edit","/wiki/Chinese_name","/wiki/Chinese_surname","/wiki/Chen_(surname)","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Taoist","/wiki/Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms_Period","/wiki/Song_Dynasty","/wiki/Luyi","/wiki/Henan_Province","/w/index.php?title=Nine_Room_Cave&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Mount_Wudang","/wiki/Mount_Hua","/wiki/Sacred_mountains_of_China","/wiki/Liuhebafa","/wiki/Qi","/w/index.php?title=Taiji_ruler&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Confucian","/wiki/I_Ching","#Legends","#Source","#See_also","#References","#Sources","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Yue_Fei","/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9620412796","/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Wu_Yi_Hui","/wiki/Chan_Yik_Yan","/wiki/Liuhebafa_Chuan","/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-ss457_1-0","#CITEREF.27.27Song_Shi.27.27","http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%AE%8B%E5%8F%B2/%E5%8D%B7457","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Toqto%27a_(Yuan_Minister)","/wiki/History_of_Song","/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&action=edit&section=6","http://www.liuhebafachuan.com/history1.html","http://www.liuhopafa.com/chenpo.htm","http://www.eng.taoism.org.hk/general-daoism/eminent-philosophers&accomplished-daoists/pg1-4-22.asp","http://waterspirit6x8.tripod.com/id65.html","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chen_Tuan&oldid=564500761","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Tang_Dynasty_Taoists","/wiki/Category:989_deaths","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Cate
