{"cursor":"62929","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cellulosic ethanol' is a biofuel produced from wood, grasses, or the inedible\nparts of plants.\n\nIt is a type of biofuel produced from lignocellulose, a structural material that\ncomprises much of the mass of plants. Lignocellulose is composed mainly of\ncellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Corn stover, [[Panicum virgatum]]\n(switchgrass), [[Miscanthus]] grass species, wood chips and the byproducts of\nlawn and tree maintenance are some of the more popular cellulosic materials for\nethanol production. Production of ethanol from lignocellulose has the advantage\nof abundant and diverse raw material compared to sources such as corn and cane\nsugars, but requires a greater amount of processing to make the sugar monomers\navailable to the microorganisms typically used to produce ethanol by\nfermentation.\n\nSwitchgrass and Miscanthus are the major biomass materials being studied today,\ndue to their high productivity per acre. Cellulose, however, is contained in\nnearly every natural, free-growing plant, tree, and bush, in meadows, forests,\nand fields all over the world without agricultural effort or cost needed to\nmake it grow.\n\nAccording to Michael Wang of Argonne National Laboratory, one of the benefits of\ncellulosic ethanol is it reduces greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 85% over\nreformulated\ngasoline. http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/354.pdf By\ncontrast, starch ethanol (e.g., from corn), which most frequently uses natural\ngas to provide energy for the process, may not reduce GHG emissions at all\ndepending on how the starch-based feedstock is produced. According to\nthe National Academy of Sciences, there is no commercially viable bio-refinery\nin existence to convert lignocellulosic biomass to\nfuel.

These issues, along with many other\ndifficult production challenges, lead George Washington University policy\nresearchers to state that \"in the short term, [cellulosic] ethanol cannot meet\nthe energy security and environmental goals of a
