{"cursor":"1756","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Circular Letter' was an early Interlingua newsletter published from 1954 to\n1965, when it was expanded and renamed [[Lingua e Vita]]. D. M. Hallowes, who\nbecame the Secretary of the British Interlingua Society (BIS), edited the\npublication. Issue 9, dated March 1956, printed a suggestion that a British\nInterlingua organization be formed:\n\n\n\n\"Mr. (N.) Divall has suggested the time has now come when the friends of\nInterlingua in the British Isles are numerous enough that they should form a\nsociety similar to those possessed by the movements for Interlingue (Occidental)\nand Idoâ¦This announcement can be regarded as sufficient to create it.\" The\noriginal quote was in Interlingua.\n\n\n\nIn June of that year, the BIS was officially founded. The 14th issue,\nreleased in November 1957, announced that twice the number of copies would\nneed to be printed to inform a much larger circle of readers. The 15th issue\nannounced the release of the first English-Interlingua Dictionary, written by\nWoodruff W. Bryne.\n\nDuring Bryne's last year as secretary, 1959, the Circular Letter was not printed\nfor reasons that are not immediately clear. When Brian C. Sexton became\nSecretary of the society in 1960, he immediately resumed publication. The\nCircular Letter was published two or three times a year until the summer of\n1965, when the first issue of Lingua e Vita appeared.\n","linknr":79,"url":"Circular_Letter_(Interlingua)","recorded":1362553610,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Interlingua"],"headings":["Notes","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Interlingua","British_Interlingua_Society","Great_Britain","Occidental_language","Ido"]}
