{"cursor":"3594","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Closure}}\n\n'Closure' is the term used to refer to the actions necessary when it is no\nlonger necessary or possible for a business or other organization to continue to\noperate. Closure may be the result of a bankruptcy, where the organization lacks\nsufficient funds to continue operations, as a result of the proprietor of the\nbusiness dying, as a result of a business being purchased by another\norganization (or a competitor) and shut down as superfluous, or because it is\nthe non-surviving entity in a corporate merger. A closure may occur because the\npurpose for which the organization was created is no longer necessary.\n\nWhile a closure is typically of a business or a non-profit organization, any\nentity which is created by human beings can be subject to a closure, from a\nsingle church to a whole religion, up to and including an entire country if, for\nsome reason, it ceases to exist.\n\nClosures are of two types, voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary closures of\norganizations are much rarer than involuntary ones, as, in the absence of some\nchange making operations impossible or unnecessary, most operations will\ncontinue until something happens that causes a change requiring this situation.\n\nThe most common form of voluntary closure would be when a group of people decide\nto start some organization such as a social club, a band, or a non-profit\norganization, then at some point those involved decide to quit. If the\norganization has no outstanding debts or pending operations to finish, closure\nmay consist of nothing more than the informal organization ceasing to exist.\nThis is referred to as the organizers walking away from the organization.\n\nIf an organization has debts that cannot be paid, it may be necessary to perform\nliquidation of its assets. If there is anything left after the assets are\nconverted to cash, in the case of a for-profit organization, the remainder is\ndistributed to the stockholders; in the case of a non-profit, by law any\nremaining assets must be distributed to another non-profit.\n\nIf an organization has more debts than assets, it may have to declare\nbankruptcy. If the organization has viability, it reorganizes itself as a result\nof the bankruptcy and continues operations. If it is not viable for the business\nto continue operating, then a closure occurs through a bankruptcy liquidation:\nits assets are liquidated, the creditors are paid from whatever assets could be\nliquidated, and the business ceases operations.\n\nPossibly the largest \"closure\" in history was the destruction of the Soviet\nUnion into the composite countries that represented it. In comparison, the end\nof East Germany can be considered a merger rather than a closure as West Germany\nassumed all of the assets and liabilities of East Germany. The end of the Soviet\nUnion was the equivalent of a closure through a bankruptcy liquidation, because\nwhile Russia assumed most of the assets and responsibilities of the former\nSoviet Union, it did not assume all of them. There have been issues over who is\nresponsible for unpaid parking tickets accumulated by motor vehicles operated on\nbehalf of diplomatic missions operated by the former Soviet Union in other\ncountries, as Russia claims it is not responsible for them.\n\nSeveral major business closures include the bankruptcy of the Penn Central\nrailroad, the Enron scandals, and MCI Worldcom's bankruptcy and eventual merger\ninto Verizon.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Closure_(business)","recorded":1374542823,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Closure_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Business","/wiki/Bankruptcy","/wiki/Proprietor","/wiki/Corporate_merger","/wiki/Non-profit_organization","/wiki/Entity","/wiki/Liquidation","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/East_Germany","/wiki/Merger","/wiki/West_Germany","/wiki/East_Germany","/wiki/Russia","/wiki/Parking_ticket","/wiki/Motor_vehicle","/wiki/Diplomatic_mission","/wiki/Penn_Central","/wiki/Enron_scandal","/wiki/MCI_Worldcom","/wiki/Verizon","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&oldid=521802100","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Business","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_August_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Closure+%28business%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Closure+%28business%29","/wiki/Closure_(business)","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Closure_(business)&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Closure_(business)","/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Closure_(business)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Closure_(business)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&oldid=521802100","/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5135520","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Closure_%28business%29&id=521802100","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Closure+%28business%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Closure+%28business%29&oldid=521802100&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Closure_(business)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5135520#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(business)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Business"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/powe
