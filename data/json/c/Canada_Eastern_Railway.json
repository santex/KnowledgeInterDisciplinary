{"cursor":"2824","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Canada Eastern Railway', originally known as the 'Northern and Western\nRailway', was a railway line operating in New Brunswick, Canada, running from\nLoggieville (now part of Miramichi), to Devon (opposite Fredericton). The\nline linked various communities along the Nashwaak and Southwest Miramichi\nRiver valleys.\n\n at Doaktown.]]\n\nA joint venture of industrialists Alexander Gibson and Jabez B. Snowball,\nconstruction started in 1884 and finished in 1887. The opening of the\nFredericton Railway Bridge in 1889 gave it a direct connection to the\nprovincial capital.\n\nThe line was rerouted between Renous and Nelson to the north bank of the\nSouthwest Miramichi River through to Derby where it joined the Intercolonial\nRailway mainline at a junction between the bridges over the Southwest and\nNorthwest Miramichi Rivers.\n\nIn 1904 the Canada Eastern was purchased by the Intercolonial Railway, a federal\nCrown corporation. The mainline of the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR),\nanother government concern, was built in 1912, creating a major junction at\nMcGivney. The Intercolonial, NTR, and others were merged into the Canadian\nGovernment Railways in 1915 and the Canadian National Railways (CNR) in 1919.\n\nCanada Eastern and later the Intercolonial and CNR passenger trains along the\nline were given the nickname \"Dungarvon Whooper\" in reference to a local\nghost story.\n\nWith declining rail usage through the latter part of the 20th century, the\nformer Canada Eastern line became unprofitable for CNR. It was abandoned between\nMcGivney and Derby in 1985 as well as east of Chatham to Loggieville. The\nsection south of McGivney to Fredericton was officially abandoned in 1995,\nalthough the last train over this portion of the line (CN's Nashwaak\nSubdivision) operated in March 1996 with a coal shipment to a heating plant at\nCFB Gagetown.\n\nThe only original trackage of the Canada Eastern that remains in service is\noperated by the New Brunswick East Coast Railway between Nelson and Chatham.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Canada_Eastern_Railway","recorded":1375061454,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Railway","/wiki/New_Brunswick","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Loggieville,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Miramichi,_New_Brunswick","/w/index.php?title=Devon,_New_Brunswick&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Fredericton","/wiki/Nashwaak_River","/wiki/Southwest_Miramichi_River","/wiki/File:Miramichi_Doaktown.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d7/Miramichi_Doaktown.jpg/350px-Miramichi_Doaktown.jpg","/wiki/File:Miramichi_Doaktown.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Southwest_Miramichi_River","/wiki/Doaktown,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Alexander_Gibson_(industrialist)","/wiki/Jabez_B._Snowball","/wiki/Fredericton_Railway_Bridge","/wiki/Renous,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Nelson-Miramichi,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Derby,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Intercolonial_Railway","/wiki/Northwest_Miramichi_River","/wiki/Intercolonial_Railway","/wiki/Crown_corporation","/wiki/National_Transcontinental_Railway","/wiki/McGivney,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Canadian_Government_Railways","/wiki/Canadian_National_Railways","/wiki/Dungarvon_Whooper","/wiki/CFB_Gagetown","/wiki/New_Brunswick_East_Coast_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&action=edit&section=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&oldid=544295298","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Defunct_New_Brunswick_railways","/wiki/Category:Transport_in_York_County,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Category:Transport_in_Northumberland_County,_New_Brunswick","/wiki/Category:Transport_in_Fredericton","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canada+Eastern+Railway&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Canada+Eastern+Railway","/wiki/Canada_Eastern_Railway","/wiki/Talk:Canada_Eastern_Railway","#","/wiki/Canada_Eastern_Railway","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Canada_Eastern_Railway","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Canada_Eastern_Railway","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&oldid=544295298","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1031960","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Canada_Eastern_Railway&id=544295298","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Canada+Eastern+Railway","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Canada+Eastern+Railway&oldid=544295298&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Canada_Eastern_Railway&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Eastern_Railway","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1031960#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Eastern_Railway","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/e
