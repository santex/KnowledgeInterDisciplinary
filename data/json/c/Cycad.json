They usually have\npinnate leaves. The individual plants are either all male or all female\n(dioecious). Cycads vary in size from having trunks from only a few centimeters\nto several meters tall. They typically grow very slowly and live very long, with\nsome specimens known to be as much as 1,000 years old. Because of their\nsuperficial resemblance, they are sometimes confused with and mistaken for palms\nor ferns, but are only distantly related to either.\n\nCycads are found across much of the subtropical and tropical parts of the world.\nThey are found in South and Central America (where the greatest diversity\noccurs), Mexico, the Antilles, southeastern United States, Australia, Melanesia,\nMicronesia, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and\nsouthern and tropical Africa, where at least 65 species occur. Some can survive\nin harsh semidesert climates (xerophytic), others in wet rain forest conditions,\nand some in both. Some can grow in sand or even on rock, some in oxygen-poor,\nswampy, bog-like soils rich in organic material, and some in both. Some are able\nto grow in full sun, some in full shade, and some in both. Some are salt\ntolerant (halophytes).\n\nCycads belong to the biological division Cycadophyta. The three extant families\nof cycads are Cycadaceae, Stangeriaceae, and Zamiaceae. Though they are a minor\ncomponent of the plant kingdom today, during the Jurassic period, they were\nextremely common. They have changed little since the Jurassic, compared to some\nmajor evolutionary changes in other plant divisions.\n\nCycads are gymnosperms (naked seeded), meaning their unfertilized seeds are open\nto the air to be directly fertilized by pollination, as contrasted with\nangiosperms, which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization\narrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific\nspecies of beetle. They have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with a\ncyanobacterium living in the roots. These blue-green algae produce a neurotoxin\ncalled BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a\nhuman food chain as the cycad seeds may be eaten by bats, and humans may eat the\nbats. It is hypothesized that this is a source of some neurological diseases in\nhumans.
