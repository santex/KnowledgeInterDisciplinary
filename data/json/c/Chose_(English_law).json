{"cursor":"4886","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Chose' (pronounced: \"shows\", French for \"thing\"), is a term used in common law\ntradition in different senses. 'Chose local' is a thing annexed to a place, such\nas a mill. A 'chose transitory' is something movable, that can be carried from\nplace to place. However, \"chose\" in these senses is practically obsolete, and it\nis now used only in the phrases 'chose in action' and 'chose in possession'.\n\nA 'chose in action' is essentially a right to sue. It is an intangible personal\nproperty right recognised and protected by the law, that has no existence apart\nfrom the recognition given by the law, and that confers no present possession of\na tangible object. Another term is a 'thing in\naction'. [http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/bj/harm/not42.html Canadian\nDepartment of Justice. Bijural Terminology Records] [http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/mca/70/2/70-2-\n101.htm Montana Code.70-2-101. Thing in action defined]\n\nA chose in action, sometimes called a 'chose in suspense', in its more limited\nmeaning, denotes the right to enforce payment of a debt by legal proceedings,\nobtain money by way of damages for contract, or receive recompense for a wrong.\nLess accurately, money that could be recovered is frequently called a chose in\naction, as is also sometimes the document that represents a title to a chose in\naction, such as a bond or a policy of insuranceâthough strictly it is only the\nright to recover the money. Choses in action were, before the Judicature Acts,\neither legal or equitable. Where the chose could be recovered only by an action\nat law, as a debt (whether arising from contract or tort), it was termed a legal\nchose in action; where the chose was recoverable only by a suit in equity, as a\nlegacy or money held upon a trust, it was termed an equitable chose in action.\nBefore the Judicature Acts, a legal chose in action was not assignable, i.e.,\nthe assignee could not sue at law in his own name. To this rule there were two\nexceptions: #the crown had always been able to assign choses in action that are\ncertain, such as an ascertained debt, but not those that are uncertain; and\n#assignments valid by operation of law, e.g., on marriage, death, or bankruptcy.\nOn the other hand, however, by the law merchant, which is part of the law of\nEngland, and which disregards the rules of common law, bills of exchange were\nfreely assignable.\n\nThe consequence was that, with these and certain statutory exceptions (e.g.,\nactions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned chose in action must\nhave been brought at law in the name of the assignor, though the sum recovered\nbelonged in equity to the assignee. All choses in action being in equity\nassignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, in equity the\nassignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-\nplaintiff or as defendant. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between\nlegal and equitable choses in action of no importance. The Judicature Act of\n1873, s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal chose in\naction could be passed by absolute assignment in writing under the hand of the\nassignor. This was later updated by the Law of Property Act 1925 s136.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Chose_(English_law)","recorded":1374525541,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Chose","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Chose_(English_law)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ambox_outdated_content.svg/40px-Ambox_outdated_content.svg.png","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/wiki/Common_law","#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271-1","/wiki/Intangible_asset","/wiki/Personal_property","/wiki/Tangible_property","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Debt","/wiki/Damages","/wiki/Contract","/wiki/Bond_(finance)","/wiki/Insurance","/wiki/Judicature_Acts","/wiki/Tort","/wiki/Assignee","/wiki/Lawsuit","#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271-1","/wiki/Marriage","/wiki/Death","/wiki/Bankruptcy","/wiki/Law_merchant","/wiki/Common_law","/wiki/Bills_of_exchange","/wiki/Statutory","/wiki/Assignor","/wiki/Plaintiff","/wiki/Defendant","/wiki/Judicature_Act_of_1873","#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271-1","/wiki/Law_of_Property_Act_1925","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Tangible","/wiki/Personal_property","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Proprietor","/wiki/Ferae_naturae","/wiki/Feral","/wiki/Married_Women%27s_Property_Act","#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271-1","/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271_1-0","#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271_1-1","#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271_1-2","#cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911271_1-3","#CITEREFChisholm1911","#cite_ref-2","http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/bj/harm/not42.html","#cite_ref-3","http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/mca/70/2/70-2-101.htm","/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Chose","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chose&oldid=547321328","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:French_legal_terms","/wiki/Category:1911_Britannica_articles_needing_updates_from_January_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_March_2013","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_text_from_the_1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chose&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chose","/wiki/Chose","/wiki/Talk:Chose","#","/wiki/Chose","/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Chose","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chose","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Chose&oldid=547321328","/w/index.php?title=Chose&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5105328","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Chose&id=547321328","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Chose","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Chose&oldid=547321328&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Chose&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5105328#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/P
