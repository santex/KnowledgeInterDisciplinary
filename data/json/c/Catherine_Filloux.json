{"cursor":"11831","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Catherine Filloux' is a French-American\nplaywright (her mother is from Oran, Algeria and her father from GuÃ©ret, France\nand she lives in New York City.) She has received awards from the Kennedy Center\nFund for New American Plays, the O'Neill, the MAP Fund, and the Asian Cultural\nCouncil. She has been a Fullbright Senior Specialist in playwriting in Cambodia\nand Morocco.\n\nFilloux's plays have confronted the issue of human rights in many nations. She\nwas first drawn to the subject upon reading of the psychosomatic blindness\nsuffered by a group of Cambodian women after witnessing the massacres of the\nKhmer Rouge, a story that formed the basis of her 2004 play Eyes of the Heart.\nShe worked with survivors of the Cambodian genocide, developing the oral history\nproject A Circle of Grace with the Cambodian Women's Group at St. Rita's Centre\nfor Immigration and Refugee Services in the Bronx, New York.\n\nHer 2005 play Lemkin's House is based on the life of Raphael Lemkin, the Polish\nJew and American immigrant lawyer who invented the word genocide in 1944 and\nspent his life striving to have it recognized as an international crime.\n\nIn her 2010 play, Dog and Wolf, a U.S. asylum lawyer seeks to win asylum for\nJasmina, a Bosnian refugee. Filloux says of her play, \"[It] is written in the\nstaggered poetry of the effort to connect and articulate,\" grappling with themes\nof identity, law, sexuality, and family.\n\nFilloux states \"For a while, these crimes were the 'best-kept secrets,' but\nthey're not even secrets. They happen all the time, and nobody cares. And that's\nthe problem on some level with doing this kind of theater. There's just a little\nwall that's been built up against these things, and to write theater about them\nis part of the challenge.\" [http://www.offoffonline.com/feature-020806.htm]\n\nIn a 2008 interview in [[The Brooklyn Rail]], Filloux states: \"For twenty years\nI have written about Cambodia, P.T.S.D., genocide and trauma. People have\nexposed their pain to me. I have tried to understand how such violence can\noccur, how people can so bravely survive, and I felt the raw need to be honest\nabout myself. â¦ To hold two opposing things in your hands at the same time and\nto balance them: Iâm in that passage, trying to be Here and There. Last time I\nwent to Cambodia, I felt for the first time I could be in two places at the same\ntime, and not compare. That came from writing this play [Killing the\nBoss].\"\n","linknr":128,"url":"Catherine_Filloux","recorded":1375056575,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Kennedy_Center","/wiki/Asian_Cultural_Council","/wiki/Fulbright_Scholarship","/wiki/Cambodia","/wiki/Morocco","/wiki/Human_rights","/wiki/Khmer_people","/wiki/Khmer_Rouge","/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin","/wiki/Genocide","#cite_note-1","http://www.offoffonline.com/feature-020806.htm","/wiki/The_Brooklyn_Rail","#cite_note-2","#Biography","#Works","#Awards","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Catamaran","/wiki/San_Diego","http://www.offoffonline.com/feature-020806.htm","/wiki/Tisch_School_of_the_Arts","/wiki/New_York_University","/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree","/wiki/Toulon","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit&section=2","http://www.culturehub.org/video/2011/3/11/dog-and-wolf.html","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Heideman_Award","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://brooklynrail.org/2010/02/theater/in-dialogue-entre-chien-et-loup-with-catherine-filloux","#cite_ref-2","http://brooklynrail.org/2008/02/theater/red-monkey-in-the-middle","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit&section=5","http://www.catherinefilloux.com/index.html","http://www.ushmm.org/conscience/analysis/details.php?content=2006-09-07","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrKmFXRefCQ","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P23Q_KC90A&fmt=18","/wiki/Authority_control","http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no2005-49300","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/61277634","/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/no2005049300","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&oldid=562172788","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:American_writers_of_Arab_descent","/wiki/Category:Algerian_writers","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_Algerian_descent","/wiki/Category:American_people_of_French_descent","/wiki/Category:Algerian_people_of_French_descent","/wiki/Category:Algerian_people_of_American_descent","/wiki/Category:New_York_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:American_dramatists_and_playwrights","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_LCCN_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Catherine+Filloux&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Catherine+Filloux","/wiki/Catherine_Filloux","/wiki/Talk:Catherine_Filloux","#","/wiki/Catherine_Filloux","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Catherine_Filloux","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Catherine_Filloux","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&oldid=562172788","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5052678","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Catherine_Filloux&id=562172788","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Catherine+Filloux","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Catherine+Filloux&oldid=562172788&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Catherine_Filloux&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86_
