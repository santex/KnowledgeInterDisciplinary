Parties to the Convention\nare required to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights\nby persons with disabilities and ensure that they enjoy full equality under the\nlaw. The Convention has served as the major catalyst in the global movement from\nviewing persons with disabilities as objects of charity, medical treatment and\nsocial protection towards viewing them as full and equal members of society,\nwith human rights. It is also the only UN human rights instrument with an\nexplicit development dimension. The Convention was the first human rights treaty\nof the new Millennium.\n\nMexico initiated negotiations, with active support from the GRULAC. When support\nfor a Convention was foundering in 2002 due to WEOG opposition, New Zealand\nplayed a pivotal role in achieving cross-regional momentum. Acting as\nfacilitator from 2002-3, New Zealand eventually assumed the formal role of Chair\nof Ad Hoc Committee and led negotiations to a consensus agreement in August\n2006, working closely with other Bureau members Jordan, Costa Rica, the Czech\nRepublic, and South Africa, as well as Korea and Mexico. The Convention became\none of the most quickly supported human rights instrument in history, with\nstrong support from all regional groups. 155 States signed the Convention upon\nits opening in 2007 and 126 States ratified Convention within its five years. In\nrecognition of its role in creating the Convention, as well as the quality of\nNew Zealandâs landmark national Disability Strategy, the New Zealand Head of\nState was honoured with the World Disability Award in 2008.\n\nThe text was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2006,\nand opened for signature on 30 March 2007. Following ratification by the 20th\nparty, it came into force on 3 May 2008. As of June\n2013, it has 155 signatories and 132 parties, including the European Union\n(which ratified it on 23 December 2010 to the extent responsibilities of the\nmember states were transferred to the European Union). The Convention\nis monitored by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n","linknr":522,"url":"Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","recorded":1374520789,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:CRPD_members.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/CRPD_members.svg/200px-CRPD_members.svg.png","/wiki/International_human_rights_instrument","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/Disability","/wiki/Human_rights","/wiki/Equality_under_the_law","/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly","#cite_note-Scoop-EiF-1","/wiki/European_Union","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Committee_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","#Genesis","#Summary","#Core_Provisions","#Guiding_principles_of_the_Convention","#Definition_of_disability","#Principle_of_.22reasonable_accommodation.22","#Prevention_of_discrimination","#Accessibility","#Situations_of_risk_and_humanitarian_emergency","#Recognition_before_the_law_and_legal_capacity","#Access_to_justice","#Right_to_education","#Right_to_health","#Protecting_the_integrity_of_the_person","#Respect_for_the_family","#Habilitation_and_rehabilitation","#Participation_rights","#Work_and_employment","#Adequate_standard_of_living_and_social_protection","#Right_to_vote","#Reservations","#Optional_protocol","#Committee_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Italy","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Mexico","#cite_note-3","/wiki/International_Disability_Alliance","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Vienna_Declaration_and_Programme_of_Action","/wiki/Communication","/wiki/Reasonable_accommodation","/wiki/Universal_design","/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights","/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights","/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture","/wiki/Accessibility","/wiki/Information_technology","/wiki/Culture","/wiki/Recreation","/wiki/Sport","/wiki/Accessibility","/wiki/Road","/wiki/Building","/wiki/Information","/wiki/National_human_rights_institutions","/wiki/Committee_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Autonomy","/wiki/Inclusion_(disability_rights)","/wiki/Equal_opportunity","/wiki/Accessibility","/wiki/Gender_equality","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Social_model_of_disability","/wiki/Disability","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Reasonable_accommodation","/wiki/Fundamental_rights","/wiki/Inclusion_(education)","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Awareness_raising","/wiki/Stereotype","/wiki/Prejudice","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/workplace","/wiki/Labour_market","/wiki/Mass_media","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/International_humanitarian_law","/wiki/International_human_rights_law","/wiki/Armed_conflict","/wiki/Emergency","/wiki/Natural_disaster","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Capacity_(law)","/wiki/International_human_rights_law","/wiki/Conflict_of_interest","/wiki/Judicial_review","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&action=edit&section=11","/wiki/Reasonable_accomodation","/wiki/Witness","/wiki/Criminal_justice","/wiki/Police","#cite_note-5","/wiki/United_Nations_Office_on_Drugs_and_Crime","/w/index.php?title=Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities&actio
