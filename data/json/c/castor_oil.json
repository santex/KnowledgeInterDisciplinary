Sometimes called castor bean oil, this plant\nis not a member of the bean family.<ref>The common name \"castor oil\" probably\ncomes from its use as a replacement for castoreum, a perfume base made from the\ndried perineal glands of the beaver (castor in\nLatin).http://www.billcasselman.com/cwod_archive/beaver_castor_two.htm</ref>\n\nCastor oil is a colorless to very pale yellow liquid with mild or no odor or\ntaste. Its boiling point is and its density is\n961&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>.<ref>Aldrich Handbook of Fine Chemicals and Laboratory\nEquipment, Sigma-Aldrich, 2003.</ref> It is a triglyceride in which\napproximately 90 percent of fatty acid chains are ricinoleate. Oleate and\nlinoleates are the other significant\ncomponents.<ref>[http://www.ienica.net/crops/castor.htm \"Castor\"], IENICA,\nRetrieved on 2011-02-16</ref>\n",
