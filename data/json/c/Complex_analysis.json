Spiegel described complex analysis as \"one of the most beautiful as\nwell as useful branches of Mathematics\".\n\nComplex analysis is particularly concerned with the analytic functions of\ncomplex variables (or, more generally, meromorphic functions). Because the\nseparate real and imaginary parts of any analytic function must satisfy\nLaplace's equation, complex analysis is widely applicable to two-dimensional\nproblems in physics.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Complex_analysis","recorded":1362372621,"links":48,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","complex_analysis","complex_analysis","complex_analysis","mathematician","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Complex analysis|"],"headings":["History","Complex functions","Holomorphic functions","Major results","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Color_complex_plot.jpg/229px-Color_complex_plot.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg/300px-Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/9/b/d9b564a7f712e9e4f3ae75cf097dfce5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/1/2/61283e82faa252bab7097e269989c3e8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/1/5/71590d3f975cea63c4bf21ccf5cd0ed2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/4/f44ab8ab0b8f9e41dd730ff57edfcc87.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/8/6/a8635c6b7884498e0b5628d9d62fd53a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/9/c69868e45d6d14cd4abd361e01ec23d8.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["argument","complex_analysis"],["function","mathematics"],["domain","mathematics#domain_of_a_function"],["range","mathematics"],["residue","complex_analysis"],["liouville's_theorem","complex_analysis"],["field","mathematics"],["peter_henrici","mathematician"]],"members":["function","range","argument","residue","domain","peter_henrici","field"],"related":["Hue","Argument_(complex_analysis)","Brightness","Mathematical_analysis","Function_(mathematics)","Complex_numbers","Algebraic_geometry","Number_theory","Applied_mathematics","Physics","Hydrodynamics","Thermodynamics","Mechanical_engineering","Electrical_engineering","Murray_R._Spiegel","Analytic_function","Meromorphic_function","Real_number","Imaginary_number","Laplace's_equation","Physics","Euler","Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","Riemann","Cauchy","Weierstrass","Conformal_mapping","Analytic_number_theory","Complex_dynamics","Fractal","Holomorphic_functions","String_theory","Quantum_field_theory","Complex_plane","Independent_variable","Dependent_variable","Range_(mathematics)","Subset","Complex_plane","Real_number","Imaginary_number","Open_set","Differentiable_function","Exponential_function","Trigonometric_function","Polynomial","Analytic_function","Holomorphic_sheaf","Vector_bundle","Line_integral","Cauchy_integral_theorem","Cauchy's_integral_formula","Residue_(complex_analysis)","Methods_of_contour_integration","Residue_theorem","Meromorphic","Laurent_series","Taylor_series","Liouville's_theorem_(complex_analysis)","Fundamental_Theorem_of_Algebra","Field_(mathematics)","Algebraically_closed_field","Connected_space","Analytic_continuation","Riemann_zeta_function","Natural_logarithm","Riemann_surface","Several_complex_variables","Conformality","Riemann_mapping_theorem","Complex_dynamics","List_of_complex_analysis_topics","Real_analysis","Runge's_theorem","Several_complex_variables","Tristan_Needham","Peter_Henrici_(mathematician)","Erwin_Kreyszig","Douglas_N._Arnold"]}
