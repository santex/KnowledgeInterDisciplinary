{"cursor":"5676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cross-cultural studies', sometimes called 'holocultural studies' or\n'comparative studies', is a specialization in anthropology and sister sciences\n(sociology, psychology, economics, political science) that uses field data from\nmany societies to examine the scope of human behavior and test hypotheses about\nhuman behavior and culture. Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-\ncultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is\ncontrolled comparison among variants of a common derivation, and the third is\ncomparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines\nsimilar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a\nsufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show\nrelationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These\nstudies are surveys of ethnographic data.\n\nCross-cultural studies are applied widely in the social sciences, particularly\nin cultural anthropology and psychology.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Cross-cultural_studies","recorded":1362671296,"links":14,"instances":["publishing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cross-cultural studies|*","Anthropology","Subfields of sociology","Economic systems","Subfields of political science"],"headings":["History of cross-cultural studies","Modern era of cross-cultural studies","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["open_access","publishing"]],"members":["open_access"],"related":["Anthropology","Sociology","Psychology","Economics","Political_science","Society","Human_behavior","Ethnography","Social_science","Cultural_anthropology","Psychology","Edward_Burnett_Tylor","Lewis_H._Morgan","Galton's_problem","George_Murdock","Human_Relations_Area_Files","Douglas_R._White","Standard_Cross-Cultural_Sample","Open_access_(publishing)","World_Cultures","Cross-cultural","Cross-cultural_capital","Cross-cultural_communication","Cultural_bias","Cultural_relativism","Ethnocentrism","Human_Relations_Area_Files","Origin_of_the_Nilotic_peoples","Standard_cross-cultural_sample","Melvin_Ember","Melvin_Ember","Andrey_Korotayev","Edwin_Mellen_Press","Human_Relations_Area_Files","Alan_Macfarlane","George_Murdock","Douglas_R._White","Structure_and_Dynamics_eJournal_of_the_Anthropological_and_Related_Sciences","Social_Evolution_&_History"]}
