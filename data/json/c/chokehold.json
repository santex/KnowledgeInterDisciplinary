This can be\nmisleading as most holds aim to strangle not choke with the exception of \"air\nchokes\" (choking means \"to have severe difficulty in breathing because of a\nconstricted or obstructed throat or a lack of air\"<ref name=oxford/>). In Judo\nterminology, \"blood chokes\" are referred to as \"strangleholds\" or \"strangles\"\nwhile \"air chokes\" are called \"chokeholds\" or \"chokes\".<ref name=ohlenkamp/> In\nforensics the terms \"strangle\" and \"stranglehold\" designate any type of neck\ncompression,<ref name=jones/> while in law-enforcement they are referred to as\n\"neck holds\".<ref name=reay>Reay, Donald; Eisele, John.\n[http://www.charlydmiller.com/LIB/1982neckholds.html Death from law enforcement\nneck holds]. www.charlydmiller.com.URL last accessed March 3, 2006</ref> </div>\n",
