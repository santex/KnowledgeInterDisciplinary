With Spiders, Termites, Ants, Elateridae, Hymenoptera, Cockroach and a\n  Flower.]] ]] 'Copal' is a name given to tree resin that is particularly\n  identified with the aromatic resins used by the cultures of pre-Columbian\n  Mesoamerica as ceremonially burned incense and other purposes. Stross\n  (1997). More generally, the term copal describes resinous substances in\n  an intermediate stage of polymerization and hardening between \"gummier\" resins\n  and amber. Platt (1998). The word copal is derived from the Nahuatl\n  language word {{lang|nah-Latn|copalli}}, meaning \"incense\". \"The word 'copal' first appeared in the English language in\n  1577. John Frampton wrote in his 'Englished' edition of Nicolas Monardes'\n  [[Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias\n  Occidentales|Dos libros, el veno que trata de todas las cosas que traen de\n  nuestras Indias Occidentales]], originally published in 1596(Monardes 1577):\n  'They doe bring from the Newe Spaine [Mexico] twoo kindes of Rosine... the one\n  is called Copall.' \n\n\"Over three centuries later, Walter Hough (1912) wrote: 'There is a great\nconfusion as to the identity of copal, the name, according to some writers,\nbeing used to cover a number of gums. It is possible that the confusion has\narisen from post conquest times when errors multiplied rapidly as Mexican\nculture slipped swiftly into the background, for the earliest reliable\nchroniclers are clear as to the commonest use of the gum which we know as copal,\nand whose characteristic odor would place it distinctly in the first rank of\nincense materials.'  \"[...] This agrees with the etymology of the\nword 'copal' from the Nahuatl copalli, literally 'with the help of this path' or\n'thanks to this path' (Corzo 1978).  \"Pom is derived from the Mayan\npo-, a root word meaning 'in harmony with the action of fire,' and -om, a suffix\nwhich denotes 'activity,' literally 'that that which is to be burnt' (Barrera\nMarÃ­n, Barrera [VÃ¡squez] VÃ¡zquez , and LÃ³pez Franco\n1976).\" â{{Citation\n | first = Ryan J. last = Case first2 = Arthur O. last2 = Tucker first3 =\n | Michael J. last3 = Maciarello first4 = Kraig A. last4 = Wheeler publication-\n | date = June 2003 date = 15 March 2003 title = Chemistry and ethnobotany of\n | commercial incense copals: copal blanco, copal oro, and copal negro, of North\n | America journal = Economic Botany periodical = Economic Botany publisher =\n | Springer publication-place = New York volume = 57 issue = 2 pages = 189â202\n | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/73805332Q5767660.pdf issn = 1874-9364\n | doi = 10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057[0189:CAEOCI]2.0.CO;2 accessdate = 16 April\n | 2010 ref = harv\n }} \"They doe bring from the Newe Spaine\n [Mexico] twoo kindes of Rosine... the one is called Copall.\" ([[Historia\n medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias\n Occidentales]]) â{{Citation\n | last = Monardes first = NicolÃ¡s Bautista authorlink = NicolÃ¡s Monardes last2\n | = Frampton first2 = John authorlink2 = John Frampton year = 1577 publication-\n | date = 1596 title = Joyfull newes out of the nwew founde worlde, wherein is\n | declared the rare and singular virtues of diverse â¦ herbes.

It is available in different forms. The hard, amber-\nlike yellow copal is a less expensive version. The white copal, a hard, milky,\nsticky substance, is a more expensive version of the same resin.\n\nCopal was also grown in East Africa (the common species there being ''Hymenaea\nverrucosa''), initially feeding an Indian Ocean demand for incense. By the\n18th Century, Europeans found it to be a valuable ingredient in making a good\nwood varnish. It became widely used in the manufacture of furniture and\ncarriages. It was also sometimes used as a picture varnish. Mayer, Ralph\n(1976). The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques. New York: Viking.\npp. 194â196 By the late 19th and early 20th century varnish\nmanufacturers in England and America were using it on train carriages, greatly\nswelling its demand.\n\nIn 1859 Americans consumed 68 percent of the East African trade, which was\ncontrolled through the Sultan of Zanzibar, with Germany receiving 24 percent.\nThe American Civil War and the creation of the Suez Canal led to Germany, India\nand Hong Kong taking the majority by the end of that century. Thaddeus\nSunseri, Wielding the Ax: State Forestry and Social Conflict in Tanzania, 1820-\n2000, 2009, p 10-12\n\nEast Africa apparently had a higher amount of subfossil copal, which is found\none or two meters below living copal trees from roots of trees that may have\nlived thousands of years earlier. This subfossil copal produces a harder\nvarnish. Subfossil copal is also well-known from New Zealand (Kauri gum), Japan,\nthe Dominican Republic, Colombia and Madagascar. It often has inclusions and is\nsometimes sold as \"young amber\". Copal can be easily distinguished from genuine\namber by its lighter citrine colour and its surface getting tacky with a drop of\nacetone or chloroform.
