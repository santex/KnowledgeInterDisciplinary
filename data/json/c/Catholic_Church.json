It is this Magisterium's task to preserve God's\npeople from deviations and defections and to guarantee them the objective\npossibility of professing the true faith without error. Thus, the pastoral duty\nof the Magisterium is aimed at seeing to it that the People of God abides in the\ntruth that liberates. To fulfill this service, Christ endowed the Church's\nshepherds with the charism of infallibility in matters of faith and morals. The\nexercise of this charism takes several forms:\" There are a variety of\ndoctrinal and theological emphases within the Catholic Church, Colin Gunton. \"Christianity among the Religions in the\nEncyclopedia of Religion,\" Religious Studies, Vol. 24, number 1, on page 14. In\na review of the an article from the Encyclopedia of Religion, Gunton writes\"\n...[T] he article [on Catholicism in the encyclopedia] rightly suggests caution,\nsuggesting at the outset that Roman Catholicism is marked by 'several different\ndoctrinal and theological emphases'.\" including the Eastern Catholic\nChurches and religious communities such as the Jesuits, the Franciscans and the\nDominicans.\n\nThe Catholic Church is Trinitarian and defines its mission as spreading the\nGospel of Jesus Christ, administering the sacraments and\nexercising charity. Catholic worship is highly liturgical, focusing\non the Mass or Divine Liturgy during which the sacrament of the Eucharist is\ncelebrated. The Church teaches that bread and wine used during the Mass become\nthe body and blood of Christ through transubstantiation. The Catholic Church\npractises closed communion and only baptised members of the Church in a state of\ngrace are ordinarily permitted to receive the Eucharist.\n\nCatholic social teaching emphasises support for the sick, the poor and the\nafflicted through the corporal works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the\nlargest non-government provider of education and medical services in the\nworld. Catholic spiritual teaching emphasises spread\nof the Gospel message and growth in spiritual discipline through the spiritual\nworks of mercy.\n\nThe Church holds the Blessed Virgin Mary, as mother of Jesus Christ, in special\nregard and has defined four specific Marian dogmatic teachings, namely her\nImmaculate Conception without original sin, her status as the Mother of\nGod, her perpetual virginity and her bodily Assumption into Heaven at\nthe end of her earthly life.
