It was among the very\nfirst aircraft in the world to be built in any quantityâall of which were\nproduced during an era of trial and error development and equally important\nparallel technical development in internal combustion engine technologies.\n\nIt was also the type of aircraft to make the first take-off from the deck of a\nship, the USS ''Birmingham'', and the first landing, on the USS ''Pennsylvania''\nseveral days apart.\n\nOriginally it was fitted with a foreplane for pitch control, however this was\ndispensed with when it was accidentally discovered to be unnecessary. The new\nversion without the foreplane was known as the Headless Pusher. Casey 1981,\npp. 73â95. Like all Curtiss designs, the aircraft utilized ailerons to\ncontrol rolling in flight instead of the Wright brothers' patented wing warping\ntechnology, derived from the June Bug of 1908.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Curtiss_Model_D","recorded":1375087065,"links":[],"instances":["aeronautics","aircraft"],"pdf":[],"categories":["United States civil utility aircraft 1910–1919","Curtiss aircraft|Model D","Single-engined pusher aircraft"],"headings":["Development","Variants","Existing aircraft and reproductions","Operators","Specifications (Model D Type IV)","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["uss_birmingham","cl-2"],["uss_pennsylvania","acr-4"],["canard","aeronautics"],["elevator","aircraft"]],"members":["canard","uss_pennsylvania","uss_birmingham","elevator"],"related":["Curtiss_Aeroplane_and_Motor_Company","United_States_Navy","Aeronautical_Division,_U.S._Signal_Corps","United_States","Pusher_configuration","Petrol_engine","Four-stroke_engine","USS_Birmingham_(CL-2)","USS_Pennsylvania_(ACR-4)","Aileron","AEA_June_Bug","1908_in_aviation","Biplane","Tricycle_gear","Spruce","Fraxinus","Wright_brothers","Wing_warping","Aileron","Pusher_configuration","Canard_(aeronautics)","Elevator_(aircraft)","Horizontal_stabilizer","Aeronautical_Division,_U.S._Signal_Corps","United_States_Navy","Russian_Navy","Eugene_Ely","Eugene_Ely","Orrin_Dubbs_Bleakley","Curtiss_biplane","Burgess_Company","Marblehead,_Massachusetts","Old_Rhinebeck_Aerodrome","College_Park_Airport","Aviation_in_Maryland","Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport","Western_Antique_Aeroplane_&_Automobile_Museum","Hood_River_Oregon","United_States_Army","Aeronautical_Division,_U.S._Signal_Corps","United_States_Navy","Curtiss_E-4","AEA_June_Bug","Curtiss_Golden_Flyer","Curtiss_Albany_Flyer","Curtiss_Model_E","Burgess_Model_A","Burgess_Model_B","Burgess_Model_C","Burgess_Model_E","Burgess_Model_F","Burgess_Model_G","List_of_military_aircraft_of_the_United_States","List_of_US_Naval_aircraft"]}
