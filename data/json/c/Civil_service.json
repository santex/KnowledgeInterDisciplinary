{"cursor":"27293","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe term 'civil service' has two different meanings:\n* A branch of governmental service in which individuals are employed on the\n  basis of professional merit as proven by competitive examinations.\n* The body of employees in any government agency other than the military.\n\nA 'civil servant' or 'public servant' is a person in the public Sector employed\nfor a government department or agency. The extent of civil servants of a state\nas part of the \"Civil Service\" varies from country to country. In the United\nKingdom, for instance, only Crown employees are referred to as civil servants,\ncounty or city employees are not.\n\nMany consider the study of civil service to be a part of the field of public\nadministration. Workers in \"non-departmental public bodies\" (sometimes called\n\"QUANGOs\") may also be classed as civil servants for the purpose of statistics\nand possibly for their terms and conditions. Collectively a state's civil\nservants form its 'Civil Service' or 'Public Service'.\n\nAn 'international civil servant' or 'international staff member' is a civilian\nemployee that is employed by an international organization. For more info\nsee The Law Of The International Civil Service by Chittharanjan Felix\nAmerasinghe These international civil servants do not resort under any\nnational legislation (from which they have immunity of jurisdiction) but are\ngoverned by an internal staff regulation. All disputes related to international\ncivil service are brought before special tribunals created by these\ninternational organizations such as, for instance, the Administrative Tribunal\nof the ILO. For more info see International Civil Service Update by Bertold\nTheeuwes or http://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=7743\n\nSpecific referral can be made to the International Civil Service Commission\n(ICSC) of the United Nations, an independent expert body established by the\nUnited Nations General Assembly. Its mandate is to regulate and coordinate the\nconditions of service of staff in the United Nations common system, while\npromoting and maintaining high standards in the international civil service.\n","linknr":426,"url":"Civil_service","recorded":1362560717,"links":54,"instances":["ireland","india","government","class","mother_of_jesus","government"],"pdf":["http://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf","http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s10/ideas.pdf"],"categories":["Civil servants|","Civil services|","Civil service by country|","Public administration"],"headings":["History","By countries","Other meanings","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Meister_der_Kahriye-Cami-Kirche_in_Istanbul_005.jpg/200px-Meister_der_Kahriye-Cami-Kirche_in_Istanbul_005.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Exam_cells-large.jpg/200px-Exam_cells-large.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Sui_Wendi_Tang.jpg/200px-Sui_Wendi_Tang.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mary","mother_of_jesus"],["aristocracy","class"],["executive","government"],["minister","government"],["central_civil_services","india"],["department_of_state","ireland"],["minister","government"]],"members":["department_of_state","central_civil_services","minister","aristocracy","mary","executive"],"related":["The_Crown","Public_administration","QUANGO","International_Labour_Organization","United_Nations","United_Nations_General_Assembly","Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)","Joseph_of_Nazareth","Quirinius","Notitia_Dignitatum","John_Lydus","Office_of_Works","Royal_Navy","Imperial_examination","Scholar-bureaucrats","Han_Dynasty","Aristocracy_(class)","Emperor_Wu_of_Han","Confucian_classics","British_Empire","Guangzhou","China","Northcote-Trevelyan_Report","Pendleton_Civil_Service_Reform_Act","Portuguese_language","Executive_(government)","Legislative","Judicial","Brasilia","Congressmen","Senate_of_Brazil","Mayors","Minister_(government)","President","Republic","Government-owned_corporation","University_of_Brasilia","Getulio_Vargas_Foundation","Federal_University_of_Rio_de_Janeiro","Imperial_examinations","Chancellor_of_China","Yan_Liben","Meritocracy","China","Qin_Dynasty","Han_Dynasty","Nine-rank_system","Sui_Dynasty","Imperial_examinations","Tang_Dynasty","Song_Dynasty","Jiedushi","Five_Dynasties_and_Ten_Kingdoms","Economy_of_the_Song_Dynasty","Scholar-bureaucrats","Copyist","Printing","Chinese_classic_texts","France","Public_service_in_Germany","Blue-collar_worker","Politics_of_Germany","Conscription_in_Germany","Strike_action","Indian_Armed_Forces","President_of_India","Constitution_of_India","All_India_Services","Central_Civil_Services_(India)","Civil_Services_Examination","Engineering_Services_Examination","Union_Public_Service_Commission","Lakhs","Republic_of_Ireland","Department_of_State_(Ireland)","Government_of_Ireland","Minister_(government)","Office_of_the_Revenue_Commissioners","Office_of_Public_Works","Public_Appointments_Service","United_Kingdom","Police","Public_service_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland","Spain","Government_of_Spain","Autonomous_communities_of_Spain","Municipalities_of_Spain","Spain","United_Kingdom","Public_sector","National_Health_Service","Northern_Ireland","Home_Civil_Service","Northern_Ireland_Civil_Service","Foreign_and_Commonwealth_Office","United_States","Spoils_system","Pendleton_Civil_Service_Reform_Act","Political_appointee","Hatch_Act_of_1939","Competitive_service","Excepted_service","Diplomacy","Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","Excepted_Service","Washington_D.C.","Institutions_of_the_European_Union","European_Commission","Executive_branch","European_Union","Bureaucracy","EPSO","Directorate-General","Conscientious_objection","Swiss_Civilian_Service","Official","High-ranking_government_official"]}
