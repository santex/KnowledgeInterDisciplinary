Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the\nAtlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. Canada is the\nworld's second-largest country by total area, and its common border with the\nUnited States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two\ncountries.\n\nThe land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various\nAboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French\ncolonial expeditions explored, and later settled, the region's Atlantic\ncoast. France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America to the United\nKingdom in 1763 after the French and Indian War, which was essentially the\nNorth American theatre of the Seven Years' War. In 1867, with the union of\nthree British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was\nformed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of\nprovinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy, culminating\nin the Canada Act 1982.\n\nCanada is a federal state governed as a parliamentary democracy and a\nconstitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. The\ncountry is officially bilingual and multicultural at the federal level, with a\npopulation of approximately 35 million as of 2013. Canada's advanced economy is\none of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural\nresources and well-developed trade networks, especially with the United States,\nwith which it has had a long and complex relationship.\n\nCanada is a developed country, with the ninth highest per capita income\nglobally, and the 11th highest Human Development Index ranking. It ranks among\nthe highest in international measurements of education, government transparency,\ncivil liberties, quality of life, and economic freedom. Canada is a recognized\nmiddle power and a member of many international institutions, including the G7,\nG8, G20, ICCPR, NATO, NAFTA, OECD, WTO, Commonwealth of Nations, Francophonie,\nOAS, APEC, and the United Nations.<ref name=\"Petersen\"></ref>\n","title":"canada","headings":["Etymology","History","Geography","Government and politics","Economy","Demographics","Culture","See
