Each party in a coevolutionary relationship exerts selective\npressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution of\ndifferent species includes the evolution of a host species and its parasites\n(host–parasite coevolution), and examples of mutualism evolving through\ntime. Evolution in response to abiotic factors, such as climate change, is not\ncoevolution (since climate is not alive and does not undergo biological\nevolution). Coevolution between pairs of entities (often referred to as pairwise\ncoevolution) exists, such as that between predator and prey, host and symbiont\nor host and parasite, but many cases are less clearcut: a species may evolve in\nresponse to a number of other species, each of which is also evolving in\nresponse to a set of species. This situation has been referred to as \"diffuse\ncoevolution.\"\n\nThere is little evidence of coevolution driving large-scale changes in Earth's\nhistory, since abiotic factors such as mass extinction and expansion into\necospace seem to guide the shifts in the abundance of major groups. However, there is\nevidence for coevolution at the level of populations and species. For example,\nthe concept of coevolution was briefly described by Charles Darwin in [[On the\nOrigin of Species]], and developed in detail in [[Fertilisation of\nOrchids]]. It is likely that viruses and their hosts may have\ncoevolved in various scenarios. C.Michael Hogan. 2010.\n[http://www.eoearth.org/articles/view/156858/?topic=49496Virus. Encyclopedia of\nEarth].
