{"cursor":"1063","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Chronic toxicity' is a property of a substance that has toxic effects on a\nliving organism, when that organism is exposed to the substance continuously or\nrepeatedly. Compared with acute toxicity.\n\nTwo distinct situations need to be considered:\n\n* Prolonged exposure to a substance\n\nFor example if a person drinks too much alcohol on a regular basis then their\nhealth may suffer as a result. The alcohol does not have a long biological\nhalflife but it is supplied on a regular basis to the body of the person.\n\n* Prolonged internal exposure because a substance remains in the body for\n  a long time\n\nFor example if a person were to ingest radium much of it would be absorbed into\nthe bones where it would exert a harmful effect on a person's health. The\nradium might cause a disturbance in the blood cell-forming part of the bone\n(bone marrow)\n","linknr":102,"url":"Chronic_toxicity","recorded":1362897926,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Toxicology"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Hazard_T.svg/30px-Hazard_T.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Toxic","Acute_toxicity","Alcohol","Biological_halflife","Radium","Bone_marrow","Acute_toxicity"]}
