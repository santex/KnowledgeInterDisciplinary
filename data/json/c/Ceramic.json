Ceramic\nmaterials may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure, or may be\namorphous (e.g., a glass). Because most common ceramics are crystalline, the\ndefinition of ceramic is often restricted to inorganic crystalline materials, as\nopposed to the noncrystalline glasses.\n\nThe earliest ceramics were pottery objects or 27,000 year old figurines made\nfrom clay, either by itself or mixed with other materials, hardened in fire.\nLater ceramics were glazed and fired to create a colored, smooth surface.\nCeramics now include domestic, industrial and building products and art objects.\nIn the 20th century, new ceramic materials were developed for use in advanced\nceramic engineering; for example, in semiconductors.\n\nThe word \"ceramic\" comes from the Greek word ÎºÎµÏÎ±Î¼Î¹ÎºÏÏ (keramikos), \"of pottery\"\nor \"for pottery\", [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3At-\next%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkeramiko%2Fs ÎºÎµÏÎ±Î¼Î¹ÎºÏÏ], Henry George Liddell,\nRobert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library from\nÎºÎ­ÏÎ±Î¼Î¿Ï (keramos), \"potter's clay, tile, pottery\".
