It is often used to convey power to the wheels of a vehicle,\nparticularly bicycles and motorcycles. It is also used in a wide variety of\nmachines besides vehicles.\n\nMost often, the power is conveyed by a roller chain, known as the 'drive chain'\nor 'transmission chain',\npassing over a sprocket gear, with the teeth of the gear meshing with the holes\nin the links of the chain. The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting\nmechanical force into the system. Another type of drive chain is the Morse\nchain, invented by the Morse Chain Company of Ithaca, New York, USA. This has\ninverted\nteeth. [http://www.1stdirectory.com/Companies/48812_Cross_and_Morse.htm\nCross & Morse in Birmingham, http://www.crossmorse.com ]\n\nSometimes the power is output by simply rotating the chain, which can be used to\nlift or drag objects. In other situations, a second gear is placed and the power\nis recovered by attaching shafts or hubs to this gear. Though drive chains are\noften simple oval loops, they can also go around corners by placing more than\ntwo gears along the chain; gears that do not put power into the system or\ntransmit it out are generally known as idler-wheels. By varying the diameter of\nthe input and output gears with respect to each other, the gear ratio can be\naltered, so that, for example, the pedals of a bicycle can spin all the way\naround more than once for every rotation of the gear that drives the wheels.\n","linknr":318,"url":"Chain_drive","recorded":1362476865,"links":33,"instances":["land_speed_record_car","car","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mechanics","Automotive transmission technologies","Mechanical power transmission","Mechanical power control"],"headings":["History","Chains versus belts","Use in vehicles","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Chain.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/1920s_Mack_AC_truck.jpg/220px-1920s_Mack_AC_truck.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Chain_drive%2C_Su_Song%27s_book_of_1092.jpg/50px-Chain_drive%2C_Su_Song%27s_book_of_1092.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/The_sketch_%28drawing%29_of_roller_chain%2C_Leonardo_da_Vinci.jpg/220px-The_sketch_%28drawing%29_of_roller_chain%2C_Leonardo_da_Vinci.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Side_chain_gear.jpg/220px-Side_chain_gear.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Silent_chain_gear_box.jpg/220px-Silent_chain_gear_box.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Absbrakes.jpg/150px-Absbrakes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["differential","mechanics"],["gn","car"],["babs","land_speed_record_car"]],"members":["babs","gn","differential"],"related":["Sprocket","Petersen_Automotive_Museum","Bicycle","Motorcycle","Roller_chain","Sprocket","Ithaca,_New_York","USA","Idler-wheel","Gear_ratio","Clock_tower","Kaifeng","Roller_chain","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Polybolos","Repeating_crossbow","History_of_Greece","Philon_of_Byzantium","Windlass","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Horology","Song_Dynasty","History_of_China","Su_Song","Armillary_sphere","Astronomical_clock","Clock_tower","Escapement","Inertia","Toothed_belt","Friction","Derailleur_gears","Conveyor_belt","Drive_shaft","Safety_bicycle","Direct_Drive_Mechanism","Penny-farthing","Automobile","Driveshaft","Universal_joint","Roller_chain","Differential_(mechanics)","Axle","Frazer_Nash","GN_(car)","Archibald_Frazer-Nash","Henry_Ronald_Godfrey","Shelsley_Walsh_Speed_Hill_Climb","J._G._Parry-Thomas","Land_speed_record","Babs_(Land_speed_record_car)","Honda_S600","Internal_combustion_engine","Timing_chain","Camshaft","Overhead_camshaft","Automobile","Light_truck","Transfer_case","Driveshaft","Motorcycle_construction","Bicycle_chain","Chain_pump"]}
