He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in\n2002, seven years after his first retirement from coaching in 1995.\n\nAult won his 200th college football game October 9, 2009 when his Wolf Pack beat\nLouisiana Tech 37â14.\n\nAult is credited as the creator of the \"Pistol Offense,\" which he instituted at\nNevada in 2005. Since becoming the primary offense for Nevada, the Pistol has\nbeen used by other schools across the country. The San Francisco 49ers began\nemploying the pistol offense with the emergence of former Nevada quarterback\nColin Kaepernick. The Pittsburgh Steelers have also been seen using the Pistol\nfrom time to time. Since installing the Pistol, Nevada has won shares of two WAC\ntitlesâin 2005 (with Boise State) and 2010 (with Boise State and\nHawai{{okina}}i).\n\nAult previously served as head coach from 1976 to 1992 and from 1994 to 1995,\nguiding the Wolf Pack from Division II to Division I-AA to Division I-A. He also\nserved as Nevada's athletic director from 1986 to 2004, and was the school's\nstarting quarterback from 1965 to 1967.\n\nAfter the 2004 season, Ault fired head coach Chris Tormey. He named himself as\nthe replacement three days later, with the approval of school president John\nLilley and the Nevada Board of Regents.
