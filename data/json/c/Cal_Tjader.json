'Cal Tjader' (July 16, 1925\n– May 5, 1982) was a Latin jazz musician, though he also explored various\nother jazz idioms. Unlike other American jazz musicians who experimented with\nthe music from Cuba, the Caribbean, and Latin America, he never abandoned it,\nperforming it until his death.\n\nTjader primarily played the vibraphone. He was also accomplished on the drums,\nbongos, congas, timpani, and the piano. He worked with numerous musicians from\nseveral cultures. He is often linked to the development of Latin rock and acid\njazz. Although fusing jazz with Latin music is often categorized as \"Latin\njazz\" (or, earlier, \"Afro-Cuban jazz\"), Tjader's output swung freely between\nboth styles.\n\nHe won a Grammy in 1980 for his album La Onda Va Bien, capping off a career that\nspanned over forty years.\n","linknr":317,"url":"Cal_Tjader","recorded":1362892313,"links":22,"instances":["musician","nightclub","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1925 births","1982 deaths","Cool jazz drummers","Cool jazz vibraphonists","Latin jazz musicians","Jazz percussionists","American jazz vibraphonists","American jazz drummers","American people of Swedish descent","San Francisco State University alumni","People from St. Louis, Missouri","American military personnel of World War II","United States Army soldiers","Grammy Award-winning artists","Savoy Records artists","Skye Records artists","Concord Records artists","Galaxy Records artists","American percussionists"],"headings":["Early years (1925&ndash;1943)","Army and college (1940s)","Sideman (1951&ndash;1954)","Leader (1954&ndash;1962)","Verve and Skye Records (1960s)","Lean years (1970s)","Final years (1979 to 1982)","Legacy","Discography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/29/Cal_Tjader.jpg/220px-Cal_Tjader.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Sabor_correct.tiff/lossy-page1-450px-Sabor_correct.tiff.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["junior","suffix#social"],["solo","music"],["black_hawk","nightclub"],["mark_levine","musician"]],"members":["junior","mark_levine","black_hawk","solo"],"related":["St._Louis","Missouri","United_States","Manila","Philippines","San_Mateo","California","United_States","Vibraphone","Drum_kit","Piano","Timbales","Bongo_drum","Conga","Timpani","Jazz","Latin_jazz","Bebop","Afro-Cuban_jazz","Vibraphonist","Drummer","Percussion","Composer","Bandleader","Fantasy_Records","Verve_Records","Skye_Records","Concord_Records","Vibraphone","Drum_kit","Piano","Timbales","Bongo_drum","Conga","Latin_jazz","Jazz","Cuba","Vibraphone","Drum_kit","Bongo_drum","Conga","Timpani","Piano","Latin_rock","Acid_jazz","Afro-Cuban_jazz","Grammy","St._Louis,_Missouri","Swedish_American","Vaudeville","Tap_dance","Piano","Anton_Tjader","Nevada","Surgeon","Mark_Twain","San_Mateo,_California","San_Francisco_Bay_Area","Wunderkind","Bill_\"Bojangles\"_Robinson","Dixieland","Gene_Krupa","Solo_(music)","Pearl_Harbor","United_States_Army","San_Jose_State_College","G.I._Bill","San_Francisco_State_College","Dave_Brubeck","Paul_Desmond","San_Francisco,_California","Vibraphone","Alvino_Rey","George_Shearing","Down_Beat","Al_McKibbon","Big_band","Machito","Chico_O'Farrill","Mongo_Santamaría","Willie_Bobo","John_Storm_Roberts","Tito_Puente","Fantasy_Records","Mambo_craze","Exotica","Martin_Denny","Les_Baxter","Oceania","Gene_Wright","Al_Torre","Vince_Guaraldi","Bebop","West_Coast_jazz","Cool_jazz","Gerry_Mulligan","Chet_Baker","Art_Pepper","Stan_Getz","Monterey_Jazz_Festival","Black_Hawk_(nightclub)","Verve_Records","Norman_Granz","Creed_Taylor","Donald_Byrd","Lalo_Schifrin","Anita_O'Day","Willie_Bobo","Armando_Peraza","Chick_Corea","Clare_Fischer","Jimmy_Heath","Kenny_Burrell","Dizzy_Gillespie","WMCA","Billboard_magazine","Chano_Pozo","Eddie_Palmieri","Lounge_music","Bossa_nova","Gábor_Szabó","Gary_McFarland","Acid_jazz","Rare_groove","Airto_Moreira","Fritz_the_Cat","Poncho_Sanchez","Grace_Cathedral,_San_Francisco","Carl_Jefferson","Concord_Records","Mark_Levine_(musician)","Roger_Glenn","Vince_Lateano","Robb_Fisher","Poncho_Sanchez","Guajeo","Manila","Myocardial_infarction","Lionel_Hampton","Milt_Jackson","Dave_Pike","Spyro_Gyra","Dave_Samuels","Ruben_Estrada","Carlos_Santana","Gábor_Szabó","Gary_McFarland","Skye_Records","A_Tribe_Called_Quest","Savoy_Records","Fantasy_Records","Verve_Records","Concord_Records","Louie_Ramirez","Clare_Fischer","Poncho_Sanchez","Dave_Samuels","Gary_Burton","Paquito_D'Rivera","St._Louis,_Missouri","Manila","Philippines"]}
