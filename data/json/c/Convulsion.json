[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000021.htm\nMedlineplus medical encyclopedia] Because a convulsion is often a\nsymptom of an epileptic seizure, the term convulsion is sometimes used as a\nsynonym for seizure. However, not all epileptic seizures lead to convulsions,\nand not all convulsions are caused by epileptic seizures. Convulsions are also\nconsistent with an electric shock. For non-epileptic convulsions, see non-\nepileptic seizures.\n\nThe word \"fit\" is sometimes used to mean a convulsion or epileptic seizure.
