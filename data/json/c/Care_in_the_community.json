{"cursor":"14625","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Care in the Community' (also called \"Community Care\" or \"Domiciled Care\") is\nthe British policy of deinstitutionalization, treating and caring for physically\nand mentally disabled people in their homes rather than in an institution.\nInstitutional care was the target of widespread criticism during the 1960s and\n1970s, [http://www.sochealth.co.uk/history/Ely.htm Report of\nthe Committee of Inquiry], Socialist Health Association, Retrieved February 28,\n2010 but it was not until 1983 that the government of Margaret Thatcher\nadopted a new policy of care after the Audit Commission published a report\ncalled 'Making a Reality of Community Care' Making a Reality\nof Community Care, Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales,\nISBN 978-0-11-701323-0 which outlined the advantages of domiciled care.\n\nAlthough this policy has been attributed to the Margaret Thatcher government in\nthe 1980s, community care was not a new idea. As a policy it had been around\nsince the early 1950s. Its general aim was a more cost effective way of helping\npeople with mental health problems and physical disabilities, by removing them\nfrom impersonal, often Victorian, institutions, and caring for them in their own\nhomes. Since the 1950s various governments had been attracted to the policy of\ncommunity care. Despite support for the policy, the number of in-patients in\nlarge hospitals and residential establishments continued to increase. At the\nsame time, public opinion was gradually turned against long-stay institutions by\nallegations from the media. Some might argue that such allegations were\npolitically driven and that the deliberate underfunding, mismanagement and thus\nundermining of some institutions by the government was used as an excuse by the\ngovernment to shut them down. It could also be argued that although there might\nhave been incidents of where care should have been improved, the care in many\nsuch institutions may have been satisfactory or good.\n\nIn the 1960s Barbara Robb alleged that her personal experience of being\ntreated at a hospital in Ely were bad. She put together a series of accounts\nin a book called Sans Everything and she used this to launch a campaign to\nimprove or else close long stay facilities. Shortly after this the brutality\nand poor care being meted out in Ely, a long stay hospital for the mentally\nhandicapped in Cardiff, was exposed by a nurse writing to the [[News of the\nWorld]]. This exposure prompted an official enquiry. Its [http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/democracy-involvement-\nand-accountability-in-health/complaints-regulation-and-enquries/report-of-the-\ncommittee-of-inquiry-into-allegations-of-ill-treatment-of-patients-and-other-\nirregularities-at-the-ely-hospital-cardiff-1969/ findings] were highly\ncritical of conditions, staff morale and management. Rather than bury this\nreport it was in fact deliberately leaked to the papers by the then Secretary\nof State for Health Richard Crossman, who hoped to obtain increased resources\nfor the health service.\n\nFollowing the situation at Ely Hospital a series of scandals hit the headlines.\nAll told similar stories of abuse and inhumane treatment of patients who were\nout of sight and out of mind of the public, hidden away in institutions. At the\nsame time Michael Ignatieff and Peter Townsend both published books which\nexposed the poor quality of care within certain institutions.\n\nIn the 1980s there was increasing criticism and concern about the quality of\nlong term care for dependent people. There was also concern about the\nexperiences of people leaving long term institutional care and being left to\nfend for themselves in the community. Yet the government was committed to the\nidea of 'care in the community'. In 1986 the Audit Commission published a report\ncalled 'Making a Reality of Community Care'. This report outlined the slow\nprogress in resettling people from long stay hospitals. It was this report which\nprompted the subsequent Green and White papers on community care.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Care_in_the_community","recorded":1372154260,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Care_in_the_Community","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_community&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Care_in_the_Community","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:TONE","/wiki/Wikipedia:Guide_to_writing_better_articles","/wiki/UK","/wiki/Deinstitutionalization","#cite_note-soch1-1","/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher","/wiki/Audit_Commission","#cite_note-marocc-2","/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher","/wiki/Cost-effectiveness","/wiki/Mental_health","/wiki/Victorian_era","/wiki/Developmental_disability","/wiki/News_of_the_World","http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/democracy-involvement-and-accountability-in-health/complaints-regulation-and-enquries/report-of-the-committee-of-inquiry-into-allegations-of-ill-treatment-of-patients-and-other-irregularities-at-the-ely-hospital-cardiff-1969/","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health","/wiki/Richard_Crossman","/wiki/Health_care","/wiki/Long-term_care","/wiki/White_paper","#Aims_of_community_care_policy","#The_Griffiths_Report:_.27Community_Care:_Agenda_for_Action.27","#1989_white_paper_.27Caring_for_People.27","#Caring_for_People_key_objectives","#The_impact_of_the_community_care_reforms","#Mental_health_and_community_care","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Public_finance","/wiki/Nursing_home","/wiki/Local_government","/wiki/Mixed_economy","/wiki/Social_security","/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care","/wiki/Social_work","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Roy_Griffiths","/wiki/Managerialism","/wiki/Welfare_State","/w/index.php?title=Leadership_and_management&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Green_paper","//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grey_area","/wiki/Mental_illness","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Minister_of_State","/wiki/Central_government","/wiki/Health_Board","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/National_Health_Service_and_Community_Care_Act_1990","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Senior_management","/wiki/Voluntary_sector","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Deinstitutionalization","/wiki/Assertive_community_treatment","/wiki/National_Health_Service_and_Community_Care_Act_1990","/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital","/wiki/National_Health_Service_and_Community_Care_Act_1990","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=8","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","#cite_ref-soch1_1-0","http://www.sochealth.co.uk/history/Ely.htm","#cite_ref-marocc_2-0","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780117013230","#cite_ref-3","http://news2.thdo.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/48168.stm","/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&action=edit&section=9","http://picnetbc.ca/guidelines.htm","http://www.picnetbc.ca","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Care_in_the_Community&oldid=550615766","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English_law","/wiki/Category:History_of_mental_health_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Deinstitutionalisation","/wiki/Category:Mental_health_law_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:National_Health_Service","/wiki/Category:Politics_of_the_United
