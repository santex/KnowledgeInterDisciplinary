{"cursor":"11865","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Secrecy' (also called 'clandestinity' or 'furtiveness') is the practice of\nhiding information from certain individuals or groups, perhaps while sharing it\nwith other individuals. That which is kept hidden is known as the 'secret'.\n\nSecrecy is often controversial, depending on the content of the secret, the\ngroup or people keeping the secret, and the motivation for secrecy. Secrecy by\ngovernment entities is often decried as excessive or in promotion of poor\noperation; excessive revelation of information on individuals can conflict with\nvirtues of privacy and confidentiality.\n\n.]]\n","linknr":280,"url":"Covert","recorded":1362567616,"links":33,"instances":["sociology","united_states","information_gathering","psychology","academic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classified information","Secrecy|"],"headings":["Secrecy in sociology and zoology","Government secrecy","Corporate security","Technology secrecy","Military secrecy","Views on secrecy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/If_You_Talk_Too_Much_This_Man_May_Die_mirror.jpg/220px-If_You_Talk_Too_Much_This_Man_May_Die_mirror.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Burnbag_Obama_Biden.jpg/220px-Burnbag_Obama_Biden.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["self","psychology"],["intelligence","information_gathering"],["freedom_of_information_act","united_states"],["secrecy","sociology"],["alasdair_roberts","academic"]],"members":["secrecy","freedom_of_information_act","intelligence","self","alasdair_roberts"],"related":["Privacy","Confidentiality","Animal","Den","Nest","Predation","Human","Shame","Fear","Acceptance","Employment","Self_(psychology)","Consciousness","Family","Family_secret","Honor","Recipe","Strategy","Game_theory","Anthropology","Joseph_Conrad","The_Secret_Sharer","Classified_information","Laptop_computer","President_of_the_United_States","Barack_Obama","Vice_President_of_the_United_States","Joe_Biden","Operation_Geronimo","Osama_bin_Laden","White_House_Situation_Room","Government","Weapon","Diplomacy","Negotiation","Intelligence_(information_gathering)","Official_Secrets_Act","Espionage_Act","U.S.","Classified_information","Security_clearance","Safe","Critical_Nuclear_Weapon_Design_Information","Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)","Sunshine_law","Political_leak","Corporation","Charities","Competitive_advantage","Trade_secret","Patent","Monopoly","Secret_society","Medical_record","Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act","Financial_report","Insider_trading","Europe","Database","Neoliberal","Commercial-in-confidence","Information_security","Physical_security","Cryptography","Cryptographic_key","Organized_crime","Information_hiding","Software_engineering","Secret","Military","Embarrassment","Propaganda","Military","Weapon","Military_tactics","Cryptography","Lie","Psychology","Sophocles","Gautama_Siddhartha","Buddha","The_sun","The_moon","Truth","Banking_secrecy","Classified_information","Concealment_device","Confidentiality","Conspiracy_theory","Deception","Don't_ask,_don't_tell","Espionage","Freedom_of_information_legislation","Media_transparency","Need_to_know","Secrecy_(sociology)","Secret_passage","Secret_sharing","Self-concealment","Smuggling","State_Secrets_Privilege","Wikileaks","Bruce_Schneier","Oxford_University_Press","Alasdair_Roberts_(academic)","Cambridge_University_Press","JURIST","American_Bar_Association","Federation_of_American_Scientists"]}
