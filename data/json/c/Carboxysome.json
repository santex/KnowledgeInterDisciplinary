{"cursor":"9901","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" image of carboxysomes, and on the right a model of their structure.]]\n 'Carboxysomes' are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in\n carbon fixation. Carboxysomes are made of polyhedral protein shells\n about 80 to 140 nanometres in diameter. These compartments are thought to\n concentrate carbon dioxide to overcome the inefficiency of RuBisCO - the\n predominant enzyme in carbon fixation and the rate limiting enzyme in the\n Calvin cycle. These organelles are found in all cyanobacteria and many\n chemotrophic bacteria that fix carbon dioxide.\n\nCarboxysomes are an example of a wider group of protein micro-compartments that\nhave dissimilar functions, but similar structures, based on homology of the two\nshell protein families.\n","linknr":255,"url":"Carboxysome","recorded":1362483825,"links":20,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell anatomy","Organelles"],"headings":["Discovery","Architecture","Occurrence","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Carboxysome.png/420px-Carboxysome.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Carboxysomes_EM.jpg/350px-Carboxysomes_EM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homology","biology"]],"members":["homology"],"related":["Bacterial_microcompartment","Carbon_fixation","Polyhedron","Nanometre","RuBisCO","Enzyme","Carbon_fixation","Calvin_cycle","Cyanobacteria","Chemotrophic","Carbon_fixation","Homology_(biology)","Electron_microscope","Chemotrophic","Icosahedron","Nanometre","Bicarbonate","Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate","3-phosphoglycerate","Evolution"]}
