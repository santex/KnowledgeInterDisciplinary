{"cursor":"7150","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" screen of an amplifier \"clipping.\" The amplifier should be outputting a clean\n sine wave with rounded tops and bottoms, but instead they are cut off flat, or\n \"clipped\".]]\n\n'Clipping' is a form of distortion that limits a signal once it exceeds a\nthreshold. Clipping may occur when a signal is recorded by a sensor that has\nconstraints on the range of data it can measure, it can occur when a signal is\ndigitized, or it can occur any other time an analog or digital signal is\ntransformed, particularly in the presence of gain or overshoot and undershoot.\n\nClipping may be described as hard, in cases where the signal is strictly limited\nat the threshold, producing a flat cutoff; or it may be described as soft, in\ncases where the clipped signal continues to follow the original at a reduced\ngain. Hard clipping results in many high frequency harmonics; soft clipping\nresults in fewer higher order harmonics and intermodulation distortion\ncomponents.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Clipping_(signal_processing)","recorded":1362484257,"links":14,"instances":["color_theory","electronics","electronics","digital_image","electronics","audio","information_theory","music","electrical","signal","signal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Signal processing"],"headings":["Audio","Images","Causes","Avoiding clipping","Repairing a clipped signal","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Clipping_1KHz_10V_DIV_clip_A_5ohms-1-.jpg/400px-Clipping_1KHz_10V_DIV_clip_A_5ohms-1-.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Clipping.svg/220px-Clipping.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Blown-out_highlights.jpg/220px-Blown-out_highlights.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","information_theory"],["overshoot","signal"],["fuse","electrical"],["distortion","music"],["saturation","color_theory"],["channel","digital_image"],["clipper","electronics"],["clamper","electronics"],["solid_state","electronics"],["sample","signal"],["clipping","audio"]],"members":["saturation","clipper","solid_state","channel","clamper","clipping","signal","distortion","fuse","sample","overshoot"],"related":["Sine_wave","Distortion","Signal_(information_theory)","Sensor","Digitized","Analog_signal","Digital_signal","Gain","Overshoot_(signal)","Harmonics","Electric_power","Sine_wave","Electric_power","Loudspeaker","Woofer","Tweeter","Power_supply","Fuse_(electrical)","Frequency_domain","Squarewave","Tweeter","Loudspeakers","Electric_guitar","Guitarist","Distortion_(music)","Audiophiles","Vacuum_tube","Negative_feedback","Transistors","Oscilloscope","Bipolar_transistors","Saturation_(color_theory)","Channel_(digital_image)","Clipper_(electronics)","Clamper_(electronics)","Integrated_circuit","Solid_state_(electronics)","Vacuum_tube","Electrons","Ferromagnetic","Digital_signal_processing","Signed-digit_representation","Sample_(signal)","Digital_hardware","Arithmetic_overflow","Most_significant_bit","Floating_point_numbers","Accuracy_and_precision","Pixel","Limiter","Dynamic_range","Dynamic_range_compression","Clipping_(audio)"]}
