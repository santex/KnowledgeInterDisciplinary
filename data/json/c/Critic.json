{"cursor":"2994","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n . Oil on canvas, c. 1916.]] A critic is a professional who makes a living\n   communicating their opinions and assessments of various forms of creative\n   work such as art, literature, music, cinema, theater, fashion, architecture\n   and food. Critical judgments, whether derived of critical thinking or not,\n   may be positive, negative, or balanced, weighing a combination of factors\n   both for and against.\n\nFormally, the word is applied to persons who are publicly accepted and to a\nsignificant degree followed because of the quality of their assessments or their\nreputation. Unlike other individuals who may editorialize on subjects via Web\nsites or letters written to publications, professional critics are paid to\nproduce their opinions for print, radio, magazine, television, or Internet\ncompanies. Persons who give opinions on current events, public affairs, sports,\nmedia, and historical events are often referred to as \"pundits\" instead of\n\"critics.\"\n\nCritics are themselves subject to competing critics, since critical judgments\nalways entail some degree of subjectivity. An established critic can play a\npowerful role as a public arbiter of taste or opinion.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Critic","recorded":1362664884,"links":32,"instances":["frankfurt_school"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Humanities occupations","Entertainment occupations","Criticism"],"headings":["Derivation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Brooklyn_Museum_-_The_Critic_-_Lajos_Tihanyi.jpg/290px-Brooklyn_Museum_-_The_Critic_-_Lajos_Tihanyi.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["critical_theory","frankfurt_school"]],"members":["critical_theory"],"related":["Critical_thinking","Pundits","Subjectivity","Arbitration","Greek_language","Analysis","Art_historian","Art_criticism","Censorship","Complaint","Connoisseur","Critical_Philosophy","Critical_theory","Critical_theory_(Frankfurt_School)","Critical_thinking","Critical_vocabulary","Critique","Cultural_critic","Film_criticism","Food_critic","Literary_criticism","Music_journalism","Review","Social_criticism","Textual_criticism","Theatre_criticism"]}
