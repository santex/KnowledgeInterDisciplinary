{"cursor":"27721","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'collective investment scheme' is a way of investing money alongside other\ninvestors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of\na group. These advantages include an ability to\n* hire a professional investment manager, which theoretically offers the\n  prospects of better returns and/or risk management\n* benefit from economies of scale - cost sharing among others\n* diversify more than would be feasible for most individual investors which,\n  theoretically, reduces risk.\n\nTerminology varies with country but collective investment vehicles are often\nreferred to as 'mutual funds', 'investment funds', 'managed funds', or simply\n'funds' (note: mutual fund has a specific meaning in the US). Around the world\nlarge markets have developed around collective investment and these account for\na substantial portion of all trading on major stock exchanges.\n\nCollective investments are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either\ntargeting specific geographic regions (e.g. Emerging, Europe) or specified\nindustry sectors (e.g. Technology). Depending on the country there is normally a\nbias towards the domestic market to reflect national self-interest as perceived\nby policymakers, familiarity, and the lack of currency risk. Funds are often\nselected on the basis of these specified investment aims, their past investment\nperformance and other factors such as fees.\n","linknr":401,"url":"Collective_investment_scheme","recorded":1362540519,"links":39,"instances":["finance","remuneration","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Financial services","Investment","Funds","Collective investment vehicles"],"headings":["Generic information - structure","Generic information - advantages","Generic information - disadvantages","Style","Charging structures and fees","Internationally recognised collective investments","US-specific collective investments","UK-specific collective investments","Canadian collective investments","Ireland specific collective investments","European collective investments","Australian collective investments","Offshore collective investments","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Financial_info.jpg/200px-Financial_info.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Assorted_United_States_coins.jpg/160px-Assorted_United_States_coins.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["trust","law_non-usa"],["volatility","finance"],["401(k_plan"],["diversification","finance"],["commission","remuneration"],["commission","remuneration"],["commission","remuneration"],["commission","remuneration"]],"members":["volatility","trust","commission","diversification"],"related":["Investment","Mutual_fund","Stock_exchange","Company_law","Trust_(Law)_non-USA","Statute","Net_asset_value","Open-end_fund","Closed-end_fund","Initial_public_offering","Initial_Public_Offering","Secondary_market","Supply_and_demand","Amplifier","Volatility_(finance)","Split_capital_investment_trust","United_Kingdom","John_Wiley_&_Sons","The_Motley_Fool","British_House_of_Commons","Hedge_fund","Private_equity_fund","Stockbroker","Financial_adviser","401(k)_plan","Financial_risk","Capital_risk","Diversification_(finance)","Marconi_Corporation_plc","Enron","Asset_class","Market_sector","Equities","Fixed_income","Stockbroker","Financial_adviser","Commission_(remuneration)","United_States","United_States","Japan","Europe","United_Kingdom","Far_East","FTSE_100","Active_management","Market","Passive_management","Index_fund","Buy_and_hold","Unit_Investment_Trust","Richard_Branson","Virgin_Group","Nicola_Horlick","SG_Asset_Management","FTSE_100","Virgin_Group","Benchmarking","Fund_manager","Tracking_error","Commission_(remuneration)","Commission_(remuneration)","Stock","Commission_(remuneration)","Exchange-traded_fund","Real_estate_investment_trust","Sovereign_investment_fund","Mutual_fund","Closed-end_fund","Unit_investment_trust","Exchange-traded_fund","Exchange-traded_fund","Investment_trust","OEIC","ICVC","Unit_trust","Unitised_insurance_fund","With-profits_policy","Income_trust","Labour_Sponsored_Venture_Capital_Corporation","Mutual_fund","Common_contractual_fund","SICAV","UCITS","Fonds_commun_de_placement","Société_d'investissement_à_capital_fixe","SICAV","BEVAK","BEVEK","PRIVAK","Instytut_spilnogo_investuvannya,_ISI","Greek_Capital_Market_Commission","Anlagefonds","SICAV","Kommanditgesellschaft_für_Kapitalanlagen","Limited_Partnership","Société_d'investissement_à_capital_fixe","Listed_investment_company","Managed_Investment_Vehicle","Unit_trust","Trustee","Responsible_entity","Segregated_portfolio_company","Closed-end_fund","Exchange-traded_fund","Financial_intermediary","Financial_planner","Fund_derivative","Fund_of_hedge_funds","Global_assets_under_management","Hedge_fund","Independent_financial_adviser","Investment_adviser","Investment_management","Offshore_investment","Open-end_fund","Private_equity_fund","Specialized_investment_fund","Common_fund","Zombie_fund","Financial_services_authority"]}
