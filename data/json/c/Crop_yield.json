{"cursor":"3744","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In agriculture, 'crop yield' (also known as \"agricultural output\") refers to\nboth the measure of the yield of a crop per unit area of land cultivation, and\nthe seed generation of the plant itself (e.g. one wheat grain produces a stalk\nyielding three grain, or 1:3). The figure, 1:3 is considered by agronomists as\nthe minimum required to sustain human life. Pipes, Richard, Russia under the\nOld Regime (Charles Scribner's Sons, NY 1974) p.8\n\nOne of the three seeds must be set aside for the next planting season, the\nremaining two either consumed by the grower, or one for human consumption and\nthe other for livestock feed. The higher the surplus, the more livestock can be\nestablished and maintained, thereby increasing the physical and economic well-\nbeing of the farmer and his family. This, in turn, resulted in better stamina,\nbetter over-all health, and better, more efficient work. In addition, the more\nthe surplus the more draft animalsâhorse and oxenâcould be supported and\nharnessed to work, and manure, the soil thereby easing the farmer's burden.\nIncreased crop yields meant few hands were needed on farm, freeing them for\nindustry and commerce. This, in turn, led to the formation and growth of cities.\n\nFormation and growth of cities meant an increased demand for food stuffs by non-\nfarmers, and their willingness to pay for it. This, in turn, led the farmer to\n(further) innovation, more intensive farming, the demand/creation of new and/or\nimproved farming implements, and a quest for improved seed which improved crop\nyield. Thus allowing the farmer to raise his income by bringing more food to non-\nfarming (city) markets.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Crop_yield","recorded":1362669631,"links":21,"instances":["wine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crops","Agronomy"],"headings":["Measurement","History","See also","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Veranotrigo.jpg/32px-Veranotrigo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["yield","wine"]],"members":["yield"],"related":["Agriculture","Tillage","Agronomists","Crop_rotation","Charles_Townshend,_2nd_Viscount_Townshend","British_Agricultural_Revolution","Wheat","Oats","Barley","Clover","Rye","Rutabaga","Kale","Turnips","Crop_rotation","Green_Revolution","Second_Green_Revolution","Sustainable_agriculture","Yield_(wine)"]}
