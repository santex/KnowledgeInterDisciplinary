{"cursor":"1263","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cultural framework' is a term used in social science to describe traditions,\nvalue systems, myths and symbols that are common in a given society. A given\nsociety may have multiple cultural frameworks (for example, United States\nsociety has different cultural frameworks for its white and African American\npopulations). Usually cultural frameworks are mixed; as certain individuals or\nentire groups can be familiar with many cultural frameworks.\n\nThere is an important relation between cultural frameworks and ideologies, as\nmost successful ideologies are closely connected to cultural frameworks of\nsocieties they spread in. Cultural framework should not, however, be confused\nwith ideology, as those concepts are separate. For example in Nazi Germany,\nNazism was an ideology, while religious beliefs, patriotism and traditions\ndating back to Germanic and Frankish tribes were part of the German cultural\nframework.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Cultural_framework","recorded":1362559236,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Culture"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg/40px-Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Social_science","Tradition","Value_system","Mythology","Symbol","Society","United_States","White_American","African_American","Ideology","Nazi_Germany","Nazism","Germanic_tribes","Frankish_tribes"]}
