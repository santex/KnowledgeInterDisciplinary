{"cursor":"13087","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Creative writing' is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal\nprofessional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature,\ntypically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development,\nand the use of literary tropes. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is\npossible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing,\neven though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is\nspecifically focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and\nnon-fictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels,\nbiographies, short stories, and poems. In the academic setting, creative writing\nis typically separated into fiction and poetry classes, with a focus on writing\nin an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as crime\nor horror. Writing for the screen and stage—screenwriting and\nplaywriting—are taught separately, but fit under the creative writing\ncategory as well.\n\n\n\n\nCreative writing can technically be considered any writing of original\ncomposition. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-\noriented name for what has been traditionally called literature, including the\nvariety of its genres. In her work, [[Foundations of Creativity]], Mary Lee\nMarksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrantâs [[Teaching the People's\nLanguage]] to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:\n\n{{cquote|Witty and LaBrantâ¦[say creative writing] is a composition of any type\nof writing at any time primarily in the service of such needs as #the need for\nkeeping records of significant experience, #the need for sharing experience with\nan interested group, and #the need for free individual expression which\ncontributes to mental and physical health. Marksberry,\nMary Lee. Foundation of Creativity. Harper's Series on Teaching. (New York ;\nLondon: Harper & Row, 1963), 39. }}\n\nThose who support creative writing programs either as part or separate from\nthe English discipline, argue for the academic worth of the creative writing\nexperience. They argue that creative writing hones the studentsâ abilities to\nclearly express their thoughts. They further argue that creative writing also\nentails an in-depth study of literary terms and mechanisms so they can be\napplied to the writerâs own work to foster improvement. These critical\nanalysis skills are further used in other literary study outside the creative\nwriting sphere. Indeed the process of creative writing, the crafting of a thought-\nout and original piece, is considered by some to be experience in creative\nproblem solving.\n\nIt is also believed by some in the academic sphere that the term \"creative\nwriting\" can include \"creative reading\" which is the reading of something not\ntypically understood to be a creative piece as though it were creative. This\nexpanded concept further addresses the idea of \"found\" materials being of\nliterary value under a newly assigned meaning. Examples of this might be product\nassembly directions being considered \"found poetry.\"\n","linknr":259,"url":"Creative_writing","recorded":1374967001,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Professional_writing","/wiki/Journalistic","/wiki/Academic_writing","/wiki/Technical_writing","/wiki/Trope_(literature)","/wiki/Feature_story","/wiki/Fiction","/wiki/Non-fiction","/wiki/Novel","/wiki/Biography","/wiki/Short_stories","/wiki/Poem","/wiki/Poetry","/wiki/Crime_fiction","/wiki/Horror_fiction","/wiki/Screenwriting","/wiki/Playwriting","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Talk:Creative_writing#y","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Originality","/wiki/Composition_(language)","/wiki/Literature","/wiki/Literary_genre","/w/index.php?title=Foundations_of_Creativity&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Mary_Lee_Marksberry&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Witty&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Lou_LaBrant&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Teaching_the_People%27s_Language&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-Marksberry-1","#Creative_writing_in_academia","#Programs_of_study","#In_the_classroom","#Controversy_in_academia","#Elements_of_Creative_Writing","#Forms_of_creative_writing","#See_also","#Further_reading","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Talk:Creative_writing#y","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Language","#cite_note-2","/wiki/K%E2%80%9312_education","/wiki/University","/wiki/Post-war","#cite_note-Engle-3","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Master_of_Fine_Arts","/wiki/PhD.","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Film","/wiki/Theatre","/wiki/Dave_Eggers","/wiki/826_Valencia","/wiki/Arvon_Foundation","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Workshop","/wiki/Seminar","/wiki/Editing","/wiki/Structure","/wiki/Literary_technique","/wiki/Genre","/wiki/Plot_generator","/wiki/Writer%27s_block","/wiki/Author","/wiki/Michael_Chabon","/wiki/Kazuo_Ishiguro","/wiki/Kevin_Brockmeier","/wiki/Ian_McEwan","/wiki/Karl_Kirchwey","#cite_note-twsOctBeqqq-4","/wiki/Rose_Tremain","/wiki/David_Benioff","/wiki/Darren_Star","/wiki/Peter_Farrelly","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/English_studies","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Problem_solving","/wiki/Reading_(process)","/wiki/Found_poetry","/wiki/Louis_Menand","/wiki/Kay_Boyle","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Character_(arts)","/wiki/Narrative_mode","/wiki/Plot_(narrative)","/wiki/Setting_(fiction)","/wiki/Dialogue_(fiction)","/wiki/Style_(fiction)","/wiki/Theme_(literature)","/wiki/Motif_(narrative)","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Autobiography","/wiki/Memoir","/wiki/Collaborative_writing","/wiki/Creative_non-fiction","/wiki/Epic_poetry","/wiki/Flash_fiction","/wiki/Novel","/wiki/Novella","/wiki/Playwriting","/wiki/Dramatic_writing","/wiki/Poetry","/wiki/Screenwriting","/wiki/Short_story","/wiki/Songwriting","/wiki/Bibliography","/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)","/w/index.php?title=Creative_writing&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Asemic_writing","/wiki/Author","/wiki/Book_report","/wiki/Creativity","/wiki/Electronic_literature","/wiki/Expository_writing","/wiki/Fan_fiction","/wiki/Fiction_writing","/wiki/High_School_for_Writing_and_Communication_Arts","/wiki/Iowa_Writers%27_Workshop","/wiki/Literature","/wiki/Oneword.com","/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell","/wiki/Writer%27s_block","/wiki/Writing","/wiki/Writing_circle","/wiki/Writing_process","/wiki/Writing_style",
