{"cursor":"36523","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'chemical bond' is an attraction between atoms that allows the formation of\nchemical substances that contain two or more atoms. The bond is caused by the\nelectrostatic force of attraction between opposite charges, either between\nelectrons and nuclei, or as the result of a dipole attraction. The strength of\nchemical bonds varies considerably; there are \"strong bonds\" such as covalent or\nionic bonds and \"weak bonds\" such as dipoleâdipole interactions, the London\ndispersion force and hydrogen bonding.\n\nSince opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic force, the\nnegatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively\ncharged protons in the nucleus attract each other. Also, an electron positioned\nbetween two nuclei will be attracted to both of them. Thus, the most stable\nconfiguration of nuclei and electrons is one in which the electrons spend more\ntime between nuclei, than anywhere else in space. These electrons cause the\nnuclei to be attracted to each other, and this attraction results in the bond.\nHowever, this assembly cannot collapse to a size dictated by the volumes of\nthese individual particles. Due to the matter wave nature of electrons and their\nsmaller mass, they occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the\nnuclei, and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei\nrelatively far apart, as compared with the size of the nuclei themselves.\n\nIn general, strong chemical bonding is associated with the sharing or transfer\nof electrons between the participating atoms. The atoms in molecules, crystals,\nmetals and diatomic gasesâ indeed most of the physical environment around usâ\nare held together by chemical bonds, which dictate the structure and the bulk\nproperties of matter. -style chemical bonds between carbon C, hydrogen H, and\noxygen O.
