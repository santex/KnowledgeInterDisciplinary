{"cursor":"3206","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'crude oil assay' is essentially the chemical evaluation of crude oil\nfeedstocks by petroleum testing laboratories. Each crude oil type has unique\nmolecular, chemical characteristics. No crude oil type is identical and there\nare crucial differences in crude oil quality. The results of crude oil assay\ntesting provide extensive detailed hydrocarbon analysis data for refiners, oil\ntraders and producers. Assay data help refineries determine if a crude oil\nfeedstock is compatible for a particular petroleum refinery or if the crude oil\ncould cause yield, quality, production, environmental and other problems.\n\nThe assay can be an inspection assay or comprehensive assay. Testing can include\ncrude oil characterization of whole crude oils and the various boiling range\nfractions produced from physical or simulated distillation by various\nprocedures. Information obtained from the petroleum assay is used for detailed\nrefinery engineering and client marketing purposes. Feedstock assay data are an\nimportant tool in the refining process.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Crude_oil_assay","recorded":1362481380,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.spr.doe.gov/reports/docs/CrudeOilAssayManual.pdf"],"categories":["Petroleum"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Crude_oil","Petroleum","Molecule","Chemistry","Hydrocarbon","API_gravity","Asphaltene","Cetane_index","Cloud_point","Cold_filter_plugging_point","Density","Diesel_fuel","Flash_point","Freeze_point","Gasoline","Hydrogen_Sulphide","K_factor_crude_oil_refining","List_of_crude_oil_products","Mercaptans","Micro_Carbon_Residue","Octane_rating","Petroleum","Petroleum_coke","PONA_number","Pour_point","PNA_analysis","Ramsbottom_Carbon_Residue","Reid_vapor_pressure","Saturate,_Aromatic,_Resin_and_Asphaltene","Smoke_point","TAN_number","True_vapor_pressure","Viscosity","Paraffin_wax","Wax_Apperance_Temperature"]}
