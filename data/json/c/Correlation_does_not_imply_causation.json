{"cursor":"23867","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":235,"url":"Correlation_does_not_imply_causation","article":"'Correlation does not imply causation' (cum hoc non propter hoc, Latin for \"with\nthis, not because of this\") is a phrase used in science and statistics to\nemphasize that a correlation between two variables does not necessarily imply\nthat one causes the other. Many\nstatistical tests calculate correlation between variables. A few go further and\ncalculate the likelihood of a true causal relationship; examples are the Granger\ncausality test and convergent cross mapping.\n\nThe opposite assumption, that 'correlation proves causation', is one of several\nquestionable cause logical fallacies by which two events that occur together are\ntaken to have a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known as cum\nhoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for \"with this, therefore because of this\", and\n\"false cause\". A similar fallacy, that an event that follows another was\nnecessarily a consequence of the first event, is sometimes described as [[post\nhoc ergo propter hoc]] (Latin for \"after this, therefore because of this\").\n\nIn a widely studied example, numerous epidemiological studies showed that women\nwho were taking combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also had a lower-than-\naverage incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), leading doctors to propose\nthat HRT was protective against CHD. But randomized controlled trials showed\nthat HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD.\nRe-analysis of the data from the epidemiological studies showed that women\nundertaking HRT were more likely to be from higher socio-economic groups (ABC1),\nwith better-than-average diet and exercise regimens. The use of HRT and\ndecreased incidence of coronary heart disease were coincident effects of a\ncommon cause (i.e. the benefits associated with a higher socioeconomic status),\nrather than cause and effect, as had been supposed.\n\nAs with any logical fallacy, identifying that the reasoning behind an argument\nis flawed does not imply that the resulting conclusion is false. In the instance\nabove, if the trials had found that hormone replacement therapy caused a\ndecrease in coronary heart disease, but not to the degree suggested by the\nepidemiological studies, the assumption of causality would have been correct,\nalthough the logic behind the assumption would still have been flawed.\n","recorded":1362123804,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"236","instances":["menopause","fallacy","mathematics","fallacy","fallacy","making_excuses","journal"],"pdf":["http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/spurious.pdf","http://www.economics.soton.ac.uk/staff/aldrich/spurious.pdf","http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf"],"categories":["Causal fallacies","Causal inference","Covariance and correlation","Misuse of statistics"],"headings":["Usage","General pattern","Examples of illogically inferring causation from correlation","Relation to the Ecological fallacy","Determining causation","Use of correlation as scientific evidence","See also","References","External links"],"tags":[["variable","mathematics"],["hormone_replacement_therapy","menopause"],["variable","mathematics"],["hormone_replacement_therapy","menopause"],["nature","journal"],["cherry_picking","fallacy"],["rationalization","making_excuses"],["accident","fallacy"],["reification","fallacy"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/4/e0412dbb6e50de76a383b8f6e7d81dce.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Latin","Science","Statistics","Correlation_and_dependence","Causality","Statistical_tests","Variable_(mathematics)","Granger_causality","Convergent_cross_mapping","Questionable_cause","Logical_consequence","Latin","Epidemiological_study","Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)","Coronary_heart_disease","Randomized_controlled_trials","Socio-economic_group","NRS_social_grade","Logic","Logical_implication","Edward_Tufte","Predation","Causality","Correlation","Self-reinforcement","Coincidence","Sample_size","Systematic_error","Statistical_significance","Effect_size","Coefficient_of_determination","Ideal_gas_law","Lurking_variable","Sleeping","Shoes","Headache","Drunkenness","Myopia","University_of_Pennsylvania","Penn_Presbyterian_Medical_Center","CNN","Ohio_State_University","Infant","Ohio_State_University","Ice_cream","Drowning","Summer","Human_swimming","Carbon_dioxide","Obesity","High-density_lipoprotein","Cholesterol","Hat","Global_warming","Parody_religion","Flying_Spaghetti_Monster","Ecological_fallacy","David_Hume","Circular_logic","Problem_of_induction","Laws_of_nature","Experiments","Twin_study","Experiment","Placebo","P-value","Regression_analysis","Exogenous","Instrumental_variables","Affirming_the_consequent","Chain_reaction","Confirmation_bias","Confounding","Design_of_experiments","Domino_effect","Ecological_fallacy","Four_causes","Mierscheid_Law","Normally_distributed_and_uncorrelated_does_not_imply_independent","Observational_study","Occam's_razor"],"members":["hormone_replacement_therapy","cherry_picking","variable","reification","accident","rationalization","nature"],"book":[]}
