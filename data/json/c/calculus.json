It has two major branches, differential calculus (concerning rates of\nchange and slopes of curves), and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of\nquantities and the areas under curves); these two branches are related to each\nother by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Both branches make use of the\nfundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to\na well-defined limit. Calculus has widespread uses in science, economics, and\nengineering and can solve many problems that algebra alone cannot.\n\nCalculus is a major part of modern mathematics education. A course in calculus\nis a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study\nof functions and limits, broadly called mathematical analysis.\n\nCalculus has historically been called \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", or\n\"infinitesimal calculus\". The word \"calculus\" comes from Latin\n([[wikt:en:calculus#Latin|calculus]]) and means a small stone used for counting.\nMore generally, calculus (plural calculi) refers to any method or system of\ncalculation guided by the symbolic manipulation of expressions. Some examples of\nother well-known calculi are propositional calculus, calculus of variations,\nlambda calculus, and process calculus.\n","title":"calculus","headings":["History","Principles","Applications","See also","References","Other resources","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Infinitesimal","4: Taylor_series","4: Isaac_Newton","3: Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus","3: Non-standard_analysis","2: Integral","2: Mathematics_education","2: Mathematical_analysis","2: Newton's_laws_of_motion","2: Egyptian_mathematics","2: Greek_mathematics","2: Method_of_exhaustion","2: Archimedes'_use_of_infinitesimals","2: Chinese_mathematics","2: Infinite_series","2: Calculus_of_finite_differences","2: Isaac_Barrow","2: Product_rule","2: Chain_rule","2: Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","2: Gottfried_Leibniz","2: Physics","2: Continuous_function","2: Limit_of_a_function","2: Velocity","2: Area","2: Fourier_series","2: Real_number","2: Linear_operator","2: Riemann_sum","2: Differential_equation","2: Electromagnetism","2: Tom_M._Apostol","1: Mathematics","1: Geometry","1: Algebra","1: Differential_calculus","1: Infinite_sequence","1: Science","1: Economics","1: Engineering","1: Elementary_algebra","1: Infinitesimal_calculus","1: Latin","1: Propositional_calculus","1: Calculus_of_variations","1: Lambda_calculus","1: Process_calculus","1: Gravitation","1: Moscow_Mathematical_Papyrus","1: Eudoxus_of_Cnidus","1: Archimedes","1: Heuristics","1: Liu_Hui","1: Zu_Chongzhi","1: Cavalieri's_principle","1: Sphere","1: Madhava_of_Sangamagrama","1: Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics","1: John_von_Neumann","1: Bonaventura_Cavalieri","1: Pierre_de_Fermat","1: Diophantus","1: Adequality","1: André_Weil","1: John_Wallis","1: Higher_derivative","1: Analytical_function","1: Mathematical_physics","1: Cycloid","1: Plagiarism","1: Newton_v._Leibniz_calculus_controversy","1: Royal_Society","1: Method_of_fluxions","1: Maria_Gaetana_Agnesi","1: Rigorous#Mathematical_rigour","1: Michel_Rolle","1: George_Berkeley","1: Ghosts_of_departed_quantities","1: Empiricism","1: Erkenntnis","1: Colin_Maclaurin","1: Augustin_Louis_Cauchy","1: Karl_Weierstrass","1: Bernhard_Riemann","1: Euclidean_space","1: Complex_plane","1: Real_analysis","1: Mathematical_proof","1: Henri_Lebesgue","1: Measure_theory","1: Laurent_Schwartz","1: Abraham_Robinson","1: Mathematical_logic","1: Infinity","1: Hyperreal_number","1: Indian_mathematics","1: Islamic_mathematics","1: Japanese_mathematics","1: Europe","1: Acceleration","1: Slope","1: Mathematical_optimization","1: Volume","1: Arc_length","1: Center_of_mass","1: Pressure","1: Power_series","1: Division_by_zero","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Philosopher","1: Zeno_of_Elea","1: Zeno's_paradoxes","1: Archimedean_property","1: Smooth_infinitesimal_analysis","1: Derivative","1: Linear_function","1: Graph_of_a_function","1: Tangent_line","1: Total_derivative","1: X-axis","1: Constant_of_integration","1: Antiderivative","1: Nautilus","1: Actuarial_science","1: Demography","1: Mathematical_model","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Mass","1: Density","1: Moment_of_inertia","1: Albert_Einstein","1: General_relativity","1: Linear_algebra","1: Probability_theory","1: Analytic_geometry","1: Concave_function","1: Inflection_points","1: Green's_Theorem","1: Planimeter","1: Discrete_Green's_Theorem","1: Summed_area_table","1: Marginal_cost","1: Marginal_revenue","1: Newton's_method","1: Fixed_point_iteration","1: Linear_approximation","1: Euler_method","1: List_of_calculus_topics","1: List_of_derivatives_and_integrals_in_alternative_calculi","1: List_of_differentiation_identities","1: List_of_publications_in_mathematics#Calculus","1: Table_of_integrals","1: Calculus_with_polynomials","1: Complex_analysis","1: Differential_geometry_and_topology","1: Integral_equation","1: Multivariable_calculus","1: Non-classical_analysis","1: Non-standard_calculus","1: Precalculus","1: Product_integral","1: Stochastic_calculus","1: George_B._Thomas","1: Joel_Hass","1: Carl_Benjamin_Boyer","1: Richard_Courant","1: Edmund_Landau","1: American_Mathematical_Society","1: John_Lane_Bell","1: Synthetic_differential_geometry","1: Florian_Cajori","1: Cliff_Pickover","1: Michael_Spivak","1: Silvanus_P._Thompson","1: Martin_Gardner","1: Mathematical_Association_of_America","1: Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","1: OpenCourseWare","1: University_of_Notre_Dame"]}
