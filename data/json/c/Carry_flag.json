{"cursor":"5751","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer processors the 'carry flag' (usually indicated as the 'C' flag) is a\nsingle bit in a system status (flag) register used to indicate when an\narithmetic carry or borrow has been generated out of the most significant ALU\nbit position. The carry flag enables numbers larger than a single ALU width to\nbe added/subtracted by carrying (adding) a binary digit from a partial\naddition/subtraction to the least significant bit position of a more significant\nword. It is also used to extend bit shifts and rotates in a similar manner on\nmany processors (sometimes done via a dedicated 'X' flag). For subtractive\noperations, two (opposite) conventions are employed as most machines sets the\ncarry flag on borrow while some machines (such as the 6502 and the PIC) instead\nresets the carry flag on borrow (and vice versa).\n","linknr":114,"url":"Carry_flag","recorded":1362666953,"links":13,"instances":["data_type","arithmetic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer arithmetic"],"headings":["Uses","Carry flag vs. Borrow flag","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["carry","arithmetic"],["word","data_type"]],"members":["word","carry"],"related":["Computer_processor","Bit","Status_register","Arithmetic","Carry_(arithmetic)","Most_significant_bit","Arithmetic_logic_unit","Least_significant_bit","Bit_shift","MOS_Technology_6502","PIC_microcontroller","Assembly_language","Bit_shift","Word_(data_type)","8-bit","Two's_complement","Overflow_flag","Processor_register","Intel_4004","Intel_8008","Intel_8080","Z80","Overflow_flag","8080","Z80","X86","68k","MOS_Technology_6502","ARM_architecture","PowerPC","VAX","NS320xx","PA-RISC"]}
