{"cursor":"15996","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n 's Arbor genealogiae regum Francorum, showing consanguinity of the\nkings of France]] 'Consanguinity' (\"blood relation\", from the Latin [[:wikt:\nconsanguinitas|consanguinitas]]) refers to the property of being from the same\nkinship as another person. In that respect, consanguinity is the quality of\nbeing descended from the same ancestor as another person. The laws of many\njurisdictions set out degrees of consanguinity in relation to prohibited sexual\nrelations and marriage parties or whether a given person inherits property when\na deceased person has not left a will.\n\nThe degree of relative consanguinity can be illustrated with a 'consanguinity\ntable', in which each level of lineal consanguinity (i.e., generation, i.e.\nmeiosis) appears as a row, and individuals with a collaterally consanguineous\nrelationship share the same row.
