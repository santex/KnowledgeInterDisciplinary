{"cursor":"6968","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In grammar, a 'modifier' is an optional element in phrase structure or clause\nstructure. Cambridge Grammar of the English Language A modifier is so\ncalled because it is said to modify (change the meaning of) another element in\nthe structure, on which it is dependent. Typically the modifier can be removed\nwithout affecting the grammar of the sentence. For example, in the English\nsentence This is a red ball, the adjective red is a modifier, modifying the noun\nball. Removal of the modifier would leave This is a ball, which is grammatically\ncorrect and equivalent in structure to the original sentence.\n\nOther terms used with a similar meaning are 'qualifier' (the word qualify may be\nused in the same way as modify in this context), 'attribute', and adjunct. These\nconcepts are often distinguished from [[complement (linguistics)|complement]]s\nand [[argument (linguistics)|argument]]s, which may also be considered dependent\non another element, but are considered an indispensable part of the structure.\nFor example, in His face became red, the word red might be called a complement\nor argument of became, rather than a modifier or adjunct, since it cannot be\nomitted from the sentence.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Grammatical_modifier","recorded":1362676354,"links":22,"instances":["grammar","class"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Grammar","Syntactic categories","Descriptive technique"],"headings":["Premodifiers and postmodifiers","Types of modifiers","Ambiguous and dangling modifiers","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adjunct","grammar"],["determiner","class"]],"members":["adjunct","determiner"],"related":["Grammar","Phrase","Clause","CGEL","English_language","Adjective","Noun","Adjunct_(grammar)","Syntax","French_language","Free_word_order","Adjective","Adjectival_phrase","Adjectival_clause","Adverb","Adverbial_phrase","Adverbial_clause","Attributive_adjective","Noun_adjunct","Participial_phrase","Prepositional_phrase","Relative_clause","Determiner_(class)","Quantifier","Ambiguity","Intensifier","Description"]}
