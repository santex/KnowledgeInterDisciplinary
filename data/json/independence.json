Walt Disney World's\nEpcot.]] --> 'Independence' is a condition of a nation, country, or state in\nwhich its residents and population, or some portion thereof, exercise self-\ngovernment, and usually sovereignty, over the territory. The opposite of\nindependence is a dependent territory.\n\nWhether attainment of independence is different from revolution has long been\ncontested, and has often been debated over the question of violence as a\nlegitimate means to achieving sovereignty.<ref></ref> While some revolutions\nseek and achieve national independence, others aim only to redistribute power\n&mdash; with or without an element of emancipation, such as in democratization\n&mdash; within a state, which as such may remain unaltered. Nation-states have\nbeen granted independence without any revolutionary acts. The Russian October\nRevolution, for example, was not intended to seek national independence; the\nUnited States Revolutionary War, however, was.\n\n[[Autonomous entity|Autonomy]] refers to a kind of independence which has been\ngranted by an overseeing authority that itself still retains ultimate authority\nover that territory (see Devolution). A protectorate refers to an autonomous\nregion that depends upon a larger government for its protection as an autonomous\nregion. The dates of established independence (or, less commonly, the\ncommencement of revolution), are typically celebrated as a national holiday\nknown as an independence day.\n\nSometimes, a state wishing to achieve independence from a dominating power will\nissue a declaration of independence; the earliest surviving example is\nScotland's Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, with the most recent example being\nAzawad's declaration of independence in 2012. Declaring independence and\nattaining it however, are quite different. A well-known successful example is\nthe U.S. Declaration of Independence issued in 1776.\n\nHistorically, there have been three major periods of declaring independence: the\nyears from 1776 to the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe; the immediate aftermath of\nthe First World War with the breakup of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian\nempires; and the decades from to 1945 to 1979, when seventy newly independent\nstates emerged from the wreckage of the European colonial empires<ref>David\nArmitage, [http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full The Declaration\nof Independence in World Context], Organization of American Historians, Magazine\nof History, Volume 18, Issue 3, Pp. 61-66 (2004)</ref>\n\nCauses for a country or province wishing to seek independence are many.\nDisillusionment rising from the establishment is a cause widely used in\nseparatist movements, but it is usually severe economic difficulties that\ntrigger these groups into action. The means can extend from peaceful\ndemonstrations, like in the case of the Indian independence movement, to a\nviolent civil war.\n","title":"independence","headings":["See also","References","Article note","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Statue","1: The_American_Adventure","1: Walt_Disney_World","1: Epcot","1: Nation","1: Country","1: Sovereign_state","1: Self-government","1: Sovereignty","1: Dependent_territory","1: Revolution","1: Violence","1: Democratization","1: October_Revolution","1: United_States_Revolutionary_War","1: Authority","1: Devolution","1: Protectorate","1: Public_holiday","1: Independence_day","1: Declaration_of_independence","1: Scotland","1: Declaration_of_Arbroath","1: Azawad","1: Revolutions_of_1848","1: First_World_War","1: Ottoman_Empire","1: Austro-Hungarian_Empire","1: Organization_of_American_Historians","1: Indian_independence_movement","1: Civil_war","1: Independence_constitution","1: Independence_referendum","1: List_of_countries_by_Independence_Day","1: List_of_sovereign_states_by_date_of_formation","1: Special_Committee_on_Decolonization"]}
