Davis served in the United States House of Representatives\nrepresenting from 2003 to 2011. He was also a candidate for governor of Alabama\nin the 2010 Democratic Gubernatorial Primary. He changed his party affiliation\nfrom the Democratic to the Republican Party in 2012.\n\nDavis was an early supporter of Barack Obama's 2008 bid for the presidency, and\none of the national co-chairs for Obama's 2008 campaign. Known for his\noratorical skills, Davis made one of the nominating speeches for Obama at the\n2008 Democratic National Convention. While serving on the House Ways and Means\nCommittee, Davis was the first African American member of Congress to advocate\nthat Committee Chairman Charles Rangel surrender his gavel in the wake of ethics\ncharges. In 2009 and 2010 Davis voted against the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to do so.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Davis sought to become Alabama's first African American\ngovernor. In attempting to appeal to a broader electorate, he lost the support\nof black voters by opposing national health care reform and failing to meet with\ncertain black political groups. He ran in the 2010 Democratic\nGubernatorial Primary, but lost by a large margin to Ron Sparks, a more liberal\nDemocrat. Shortly after, Davis announced he would be not\nbe seeking another term in Congress, but would instead be returning to the\npractice of law. In May 2012, he confirmed that he was considering running for\nCongress as a Republican.
