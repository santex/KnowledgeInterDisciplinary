The majority are due to defects of single\ngenes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances\n(substrates) into others (products). In most of the disorders, problems arise\ndue to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal\nfunction, or to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential\ncompounds. Inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to as 'congenital\nmetabolic diseases' or 'inherited metabolic diseases'.\n\nThe term inborn error of metabolism was coined by a British physician, Archibald\nGarrod (1857â1936), in the early 20th century (1908). He is known for work that\nprefigured the \"one gene-one enzyme\" hypothesis, based on his studies on the\nnature and inheritance of alkaptonuria. His seminal text, [http://www.esp.org/books/garrod/inborn-\nerrors/facsimile/ Inborn Errors of Metabolism] was published in 1923.\n","linknr":1255,"url":"Inborn_error_of_metabolism","recorded":1362481971,"links":36,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pediatrics","Inborn errors of metabolism|","Medical genetics","Metabolism"],"headings":["Major categories of inherited metabolic diseases","Incidence","Manifestations and presentations","Diagnostic techniques","Treatment","Resources","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","product"],"related":["Genetic_disease","Metabolism","Gene","Enzyme","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Product_(chemistry)","Archibald_Garrod","\"one_gene-one_enzyme\"_hypothesis","Alkaptonuria","Carbohydrate","Amino_acid","Organic_acid","Lysosomal_storage_disease","ICD","Inborn_errors_of_carbohydrate_metabolism","Glycogen_storage_disease","List_of_amino_acid_metabolism_disorders","Phenylketonuria","Maple_syrup_urine_disease","Glutaric_acidemia_type_1","Urea_Cycle_Disorder","Carbamoyl_phosphate_synthetase_I_deficiency","Organic_acid","Organic_aciduria","Alcaptonuria","List_of_fatty_acid_metabolism_disorders","Mitochondrial","Medium-chain_acyl-coenzyme_A_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Porphyrin","Acute_intermittent_porphyria","Purine","Pyrimidine","Lesch-Nyhan_syndrome","Inborn_errors_of_steroid_metabolism","Lipoid_congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia","Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia","Mitochondrial","Kearns-Sayre_syndrome","Peroxisomal","Zellweger_syndrome","Lysosomal_storage_disorder","Gaucher's_disease","Niemann_Pick_disease","British_Columbia","Single_gene_disorders","Phenylketonuria","Lysosomal_storage_disease","Peroxisomal_disorder","Mitochondrial_disease","Glycogen_storage_disease","Growth_failure","Failure_to_thrive","Intersex","Delayed_puberty","Precocious_puberty","Developmental_delay","Seizure","Dementia","Encephalopathy","Stroke","Deafness","Blindness","Pain_agnosia","Rash","Pigmentation","Hirsutism","Immunodeficiency","Thrombocytopenia","Anemia","Spleen","Lymph_node","Cancer","Vomiting","Diarrhea","Abdominal_pain","Urination","Renal_failure","Dehydration","Edema","Hypotension","Heart_failure","Hypertension","Myocardial_infarction","Hepatomegaly","Jaundice","Liver_failure","Congenital_malformation","Hyperventilation","Respiratory_failure","Clinical_depression","Psychosis","Muscle","Hypothyroidism","Adrenal_insufficiency","Hypogonadism","Diabetes_mellitus","Newborn_screening","Diagnostic_test","Ferric_chloride_test","Ninhydrin","Paper_chromatography","Amino_acid","Guthrie_test","Amino_acids","Blood_plasma","Urine","Organic_acid","Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry","Acylcarnitines","Mass_spectrometry","Purines","Pyrimidines","Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry","Biopsy","Necropsy","Liver","Muscle","Brain","Bone_marrow","DNA_testing","Amino_acid_disorder","Phenylketonuria","Amino_acid_disorder","Glycogen_storage_disease","Hypoglycemia","Thiamine","Lactic_acidosis","Charles_Scriver","Metab-L","National_Institutes_of_Health"]}
