{"cursor":"14156","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] 'Rosin', also called 'colophony' or 'Greek pitch' (Pix grÃ¦ca), is a solid\nform of resin obtained from pines and some other plants, mostly conifers,\nproduced by heating fresh liquid resin to vaporize the volatile liquid terpene\ncomponents. It is semi-transparent and varies in color from yellow to black. At\nroom temperature rosin is brittle, but it melts at stove-top temperatures. It\nchiefly consists of different resin acids, especially abietic acid.\nThe term \"colophony\" comes from colophonia resina or \"resin from the pine trees\nof Colophon,\" an ancient Ionic city.\n","linknr":379,"url":"Rosin","recorded":1362481490,"links":48,"instances":["engineering","chemistry","city","department","optics","metallurgy","instrument","optics","music","lubricant","resin"],"pdf":["http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg249.pdf"],"categories":["Resins"],"headings":["Uses","Production","Properties","Sources","See also","Sources","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Rosin.jpg/220px-Rosin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Abietic_acid.svg/220px-Abietic_acid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Rosins.JPG/220px-Rosins.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Kolophonium.jpg/220px-Kolophonium.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Rosin.JPG/220px-Rosin.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volatility","chemistry"],["colophon","city"],["flux","metallurgy"],["flux","metallurgy"],["pitch","resin"],["lens","optics"],["bow","music"],["bow","music"],["bow","music"],["bridge","instrument"],["traction","engineering"],["opacity","optics"],["grease","lubricant"],["landes","department"]],"members":["traction","volatility","colophon","landes","lens","flux","bridge","opacity","bow","grease","pitch"],"related":["Resin","Pine","Plant","Pinophyta","Volatility_(chemistry)","Terpene","Resin_acid","Abietic_acid","Colophon_(city)","Ionia","Printing","Ink","Varnish","Adhesive","Soap","Paper","Sizing","Soft_drink","Solder","Flux_(metallurgy)","Sealing_wax","Glazing_agent","Medicine","Chewing_gum","E_number","Glycerol_esters_of_wood_rosins","Emulsifier","Soft_drink","Pharmaceutical","Flux_(metallurgy)","Soldering","Lead","Tin","Solder","Melting","Metal","Redox","Oxide","Pitch_(resin)","Glass","Polishing","Lens_(optics)","Linseed_oil","Friction","Bow_(music)","Bow_(music)","Beeswax","Gold","Silver","Tin","Iron_Meteorite","Stiction","Friction","Bow_(music)","Bridge_(instrument)","Banjo","Banjolele","Ballet","Flamenco","Irish_Dance","Fencing","Boxing","Gymnasts","Olympic_weightlifting","Drag_racing","Traction_(engineering)","Bull_riding","Baseball","Pitcher","Ten-pin_bowling","Ball","Dog_grooming","Fly_paper","Oleoresin","Pine","Turpentine","Essential_oil","Distillation","Still","Opacity_(optics)","Tall_oil","Kraft_paper","Naphtha","Oil_refinery","Solid_phase_extraction","Vacuum_distillation","Fatty_acid","Steam_distillation","Destructive_distillation","Rosin_oil","Grease_(lubricant)","Adulterant","Brittle","Glass","Crystal","Ethanol","Diethyl_ether","Benzene","Chloroform","Abietic_acid","Alkali","Rosinate","Pinate","Rosin_soap","Soap_making","Varnishes","Sealing_wax","Adhesive","Wax","Lager","Casks","Occupational_asthma","Double_bass","Laser_printer","Contact_dermatitis","Resin_extraction","Indonesia","China","Guangdong","Guangxi","Fujian","Yunnan","Jiangxi","Vietnam","Turpentine","Masson's_Pine","Slash_Pine","United_States","Longleaf_Pine","Loblolly_Pine","Mexico","Pine","Michoacán","France","Les_Landes","Departments_of_France","Gironde","Landes_(department)","Maritime_Pine","Scots_Pine","Aleppo_Pine","Mediterranean","Resin","Copal","Amber"]}
