{"cursor":"31043","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n meeting the Earth's planetary boundary layer and troposphere.]] on an\n ocean coast.]]\n\n\n\nAn 'ocean' (; the World Ocean of classical antiquity ) is a body of\nsaline water that composes a large part of a planet's hydrosphere. In\nthe context of Earth, it refers to one or all of the major divisions of the\nplanet's World Ocean â they are, in descending order of area, the Pacific,\nAtlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.\nThe word \"sea\" is often used interchangeably with \"ocean\", but strictly speaking\na sea is a body of saline water (possibly a division of the World Ocean) partly\nor fully enclosed by land.\n\nEarth's global ocean is the largest confirmed surface ocean on all observable\nplanets. Approximately 72% of the planet's surface\n(~3.6x10 8 km 2) is covered by saline water that is\ncustomarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, although\nsome sources prove that the ocean only covers approximately 71% of the Earth's\nsurface. In terms of the hydrosphere of the Earth, the\nocean contains 97% of the Earth's water. Oceanographers have stated that out of\n97%, only 5% of the ocean as a whole on Earth has been explored. Because it is the principal component of Earth's\nhydrosphere, the world ocean is integral to all known life, forms part of the\ncarbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns. The total volume is\napproximately 1.3 billion cubic kilometres (310 million cu mi) with an average depth of . It is the habitat of 230,000 known species, although much of the\nocean's depths remain unexplored and it is estimated that over two million\nmarine species exist. The origin of Earth's oceans is still unknown,\nbut oceans are believed to have formed in the Hadean period and may have been\nthe impetus for the emergence of life.\n\nExtraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and\ncompounds. The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface\nliquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence for the existence of\noceans elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars\nand Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean\nhypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was once covered\nby water, though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic, and a runaway\ngreenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such\nas salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point, so that water\nmight exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or\nconvecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many\ndwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is believed\nto have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's gas giant\nplanets are also believed to possess liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be\nconfirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons,\nincluding surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone.\nOcean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely\ncovered with liquid.
