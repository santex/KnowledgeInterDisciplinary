They are the simplest known\npolysporangiophytes, i.e. plants with sporophytes bearing many spore-forming\norgans (sporangia) on branched stems. They were formerly classified among the\nrhyniophytes, but it was later found that some of the original members of the\ngroup had simple vascular tissue and others did not.\n\nIn 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram for the polysporangiophytes in which\nthe Horneophytopsida are shown as the sister group of all other\npolysporangiophytes. One other former rhyniophyte, Aglaophyton, is\nalso placed outside the tracheophyte clade, as it did not possess true vascular\ntissue (in particular did not have tracheids), although its conducting tissue is\nmore complex than that of the Horneophytopsida.\n\n{{clade\n|  label1=polysporangiophytes 1=\n}}\n\n(See the Polysporangiophyte article for the expanded cladogram.)\n\nThe class currently includes the genera [[Caia (plant)|Caia]], [[Horneophyton]],\nand [[Tortilicaulis]]. Horneophyton is the best known genus; see that article\nfor a description.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Horneophytopsida","recorded":1362477092,"links":18,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Prehistoric plants","Devonian life","Silurian life"],"headings":["References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Horneophyton.svg/220px-Horneophyton.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["class","biology"]],"members":["class"],"related":["Class_(biology)","Vascular_tissue","Late_Silurian","Early_Devonian","Polysporangiophyte","Sporangium","Rhyniophyte","Cladogram","Tracheid","Polysporangiophyte","Polysporangiophyte","Polysporangiophytes"]}
