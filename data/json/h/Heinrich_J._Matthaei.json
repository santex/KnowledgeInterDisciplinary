Heinrich Matthaei' (born 4 May 1929 in Bonn) is a German biochemist. He\nis best known for his unique contribution to solving the genetic code on 15 May\n1961. Whilst a post-doctoral visitor in the laboratory of Marshall Warren\nNirenberg at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, he discovered that a synthetic RNA\npolynucleotide, composed of a repeating uridylic acid residue, coded for a\npolypeptide chain encoding just one kind of amino acid, phenylalanine. In\nscientific terms, he discovered that polyU codes for polyphenylalanine and hence\nthe coding unit for this amino acid is composed of a series of Us or, as we now\nknow the genetic code is read in triplets, the codon for phenylalanine is UUU.\nThis single experiment opened the way to the solution of the genetic code. It\nwas for this and later work on the genetic code for which Nirenberg shared the\nNobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology. In addition, Matthaei and his co-wokers\nin the following years published a multitude of results concerning the early\nunderstanding of the form and function of the genetic code.\n\nWhy Matthaei, who personally deciphered the genetic code, was excluded from this\nscientific prize is one of the Nobel Prize controversies. Later, Matthaei was a\nmember of the Max Planck Society in GÃ¶ttingen.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Heinrich_J._Matthaei","recorded":1362483933,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["German biochemists","1929 births","Living people"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Nierenberg_matthaei.jpg/220px-Nierenberg_matthaei.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/40px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Genetic_code","Biochemist","Genetic_code","Marshall_Warren_Nirenberg","National_Institutes_of_Health","Bethesda,_Maryland","RNA","Polypeptide","Phenylalanine","Genetic_code","Codon","Nobel_Prize","Nobel_Prize_controversies","Max_Planck_Society","Göttingen"]}
