It typically becomes noticeable in mid-adult life. HD is the most\ncommon genetic cause of abnormal involuntary writhing movements called chorea,\nwhich is why the disease used to be called 'Huntington's chorea'.\n\nIt is much more common in people of Western European descent than in those of\nAsian or African ancestry. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant\nmutation in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin,\nwhich means any child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of\ninheriting the disease. Physical symptoms of Huntington's disease can begin at\nany age from infancy to old age, but usually begin between 35 and 44 years of\nage. Through genetic anticipation, the disease may develop earlier in life in\neach successive generation. About 6% of cases start before the age of 21 years\nwith an akinetic-rigid syndrome; they progress faster and vary slightly. The\nvariant is classified as 'juvenile', 'akinetic-rigid' or 'Westphal variant HD'.\n\nThe Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also\ncalled \"huntingtin\". Expansion of a CAG triplet repeat stretch within the\nHuntingtin gene results in a different (mutant) form of the protein, which\ngradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully\nunderstood. The genetic basis of HD was discovered in 1993 by an international\ncollaborative effort spearheaded by the Hereditary Disease Foundation.\n\nGenetic testing can be performed at any stage of development, even before the\nonset of symptoms. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an\nindividual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have\nthe right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and\ndisclosure of test results. Genetic counseling has developed to inform and aid\nindividuals considering genetic testing and has become a model for other\ngenetically dominant diseases.\n\nSymptoms of the disease can vary between individuals and even among affected\nmembers of the same family, but usually progress predictably. The earliest\nsymptoms are often subtle problems with mood or cognition. A general lack of\ncoordination and an unsteady gait often follows. As the disease advances,\nuncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent, along with a decline\nin mental abilities and behavioral and psychiatric problems. Physical abilities\nare gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult. Mental\nabilities generally decline into dementia. Complications such as pneumonia,\nheart disease, and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy to around\ntwenty years after symptoms begin. There is no cure for HD, and full-time care\nis required in the later stages of the disease. Existing pharmaceutical and non-\ndrug treatments can relieve many of its symptoms.\n\nResearch and support organizations, first founded in the 1960s and increasing in\nnumber, work to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals\nand their families, and to promote and facilitate research. Many new research\ndiscoveries have been made and understanding of the disease is improving.\nCurrent research directions include determining the exact mechanism of the\ndisease, improving animal models to expedite research, clinical trials of\npharmaceuticals to treat symptoms or slow the progression of the disease, and\nstudying procedures such as stem cell therapy with the goal of repairing damage\ncaused by the disease.\n","linknr":1960,"url":"Huntington's_disease","recorded":1362503733,"links":82,"instances":["disease","genetics","protein","biology","genetics","genetics","genetics","human","neuropsychology","physician"],"pdf":["http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/jpn/vol-31/issue-1/pdf/pg21.pdf","http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/jpn/vol-31/issue-1/pdf/pg21.pdf","http://www.hdac.org/caregiving/pdf/Caregiver_Handbook.pdf","http://www.hdac.org/caregiving/pdf/Caregiver_Handbook.pdf","http://www.euro-hd.net/html/network/groups/physio/physiotherapy-guidance-doc-2009.pdf","http://www.euro-hd.net/html/network/groups/physio/physiotherapy-guidance-doc-2009.pdf","http://www.hdsa.org/static/resolutionhdprint.pdf","http://www.hdsa.org/static/resolutionhdprint.pdf"],"categories":["Huntington's
