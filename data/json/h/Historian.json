{"cursor":"25016","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (5th century BC), the great Greek historian; one of the earliest historians\n whose work survives.]]\n\nA 'historian' is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded\nas an authority on it. Historians are\nconcerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events\nas relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If\nthe individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the\nindividual is a historian of prehistory. Although \"historian\" can be used to\ndescribe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently\nfor those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians,\nthough, are recognized by publications or training and experience. Herman, A. M. (1998). Occupational outlook handbook: 1998-99\nedition. Indianapolis: JIST Works. Page 525. \"Historian\" became a\nprofessional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities\nwere emerging in Germany and elsewhere.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Historian","recorded":1362666771,"links":56,"instances":["english_judge","discipline"],"pdf":["http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/110-8/schneider.pdf","http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/110-8/schneider.pdf"],"categories":["Historians|","Humanities occupations"],"headings":["Objective historian","History analysis","Historiography","Education and profession","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/AGMA_H%C3%A9rodote.jpg/230px-AGMA_H%C3%A9rodote.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/%D0%9D%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%86.jpg/220px-%D0%9D%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%86.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/IHR_seminar_3.jpg/220px-IHR_seminar_3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["charles_gray","english_judge"],["historical_revisionism","negationism#revisionist_techniques"],["labor_history","discipline"]],"members":["charles_gray","labor_history","historical_revisionism"],"related":["Prehistory","Academic_degree","Reasonable_person","The_man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus","David_Irving","Charles_Gray_(English_judge)","Richard_J._Evans","Holocaust_denier","Daubert_standard","Narrative","Economics","Sociology","Politics","Psychology","Anthropology","Philosophy","Linguistics","Archaeology","Russian_historians","Viktor_Vasnetsov","Herodotus","Thucydides","Herodotus","Oral_history","Greeks","Mediterranean","Battle_of_Thermopylae","Thucydides","Reportage","Athens","Sparta","Plutarch","Polybius","Tacitus","Roman_historiography","Middle_Ages","Renaissance","Edward_Gibbon","Montesquieu","Sima_Qian","Han_Dynasty","Chinese_historiography","History_of_China","Yellow_Emperor","Emperor_Wu_of_Han","Twenty-Four_Histories","Ibn_Abd-el-Hakem","Al-Jahiz","Abū_Muhammad_al-Hasan_al-Hamdānī","Ali_al-Masudi","Ibn_Khaldun","Prolegomenon","Voltaire","The_Enlightenment","Charles_de_Secondat,_baron_de_Montesquieu","The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire","Leopold_von_Ranke","Primary_source","Narrative_history","Classicist","Barthold_Georg_Niebuhr","Theodor_Mommsen","Johann_Gustav_Droysen","Heinrich_von_Sybel","Heinrich_von_Treitschke","History_journal","Whig_history","Social_history","Historical_demography","Ethnic_history","Women's_history","Environmental_history","Cultural_history","Labor_history_(discipline)","Eugene_D._Genovese","Edward_Said","Thomas_H._Bender","Seminar","Institute_of_Historical_Research","List_of_historians","Antiquarian","Auxiliary_sciences_of_history","Historiography"]}
