The specific case of\nheterozygote advantage due to a single locus is known as overdominance.\nCarr DE, Dudash MR (2003). Recent approaches into the\ngenetic basis of inbreeding depression in plants. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol\nSci 358(1434):1071-1084. PMID: 12831473 PMCID: PMC1693197 In more general\nterms, overdominance, as described in the article Overdominance, is a condition\nin genetics where the phenotype of the heterozygote lies outside of the\nphenotypical range of both homozygote parents, and heterozygous individuals have\na higher fitness than homozygous individuals.\n\nPolymorphism can be maintained by selection favoring the heterozygote, and this\nmechanism is used to explain the occurrence of some kinds of genetic\nvariability. A common example is the case where the heterozygote conveys both\nadvantages and disadvantages, while both homozygotes convey a disadvantage. A\nwell-established case of heterozygote advantage is that of the gene involved in\nsickle cell anaemia.\n\nOften, the advantages and disadvantages conveyed are rather complicated, because\nmore than one gene may influence a given trait or morph. Major genes almost\nalways have multiple effects (pleiotropism), which can simultaneously convey\nseparate advantageous traits and disadvantageous traits upon the same organism.\nIn this instance, the state of the organism's environment will provide\nselection, with a net effect either favoring or working in opposition to the\ngene, until an environmentally determined equilibrium is reached.\n\nHeterozygote advantage is a major underlying mechanism for heterosis, or \"hybrid\nvigor\", which is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in\na hybrid offspring. Previous research, comparing measures of dominance,\noverdominance and epistasis (mostly in plants), found that the majority of cases\nof heterozygote advantage were due to complementation (or dominance), the\nmasking of deleterious recessive alleles by wild-type alleles, as discussed in\nthe articles Heterosis and Complementation (genetics), but there were also\nfindings of overdominance, especially in rice. More recent\nresearch, however, has established that there is also an epigenetic contribution\nto heterozygote advantage, primarily as determined in plants, Chen ZJ\n(2010).
