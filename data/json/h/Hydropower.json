{"cursor":"14120","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, United States; hydropower was used here to mill flour.]] 'Hydropower' or\n'water power' is power derived from the energy of falling water, which may be\nharnessed for useful purposes. Since ancient times, hydropower has been used\nfor irrigation and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as\nwatermills, sawmills, textile mills, dock cranes, domestic lifts, power houses\nand paint making.\n\nSince the early 20th century, the term is used almost exclusively in conjunction\nwith the modern development of hydro-electric power, which allowed use of\ndistant energy sources. Another method used to transmit energy used a trompe,\nwhich produces compressed air from falling water. Compressed air could then be\npiped to power other machinery at a distance from the waterfall. Hydro power is\na renewable energy source.\n\nWater's power is manifested in hydrology, by the forces of water on the riverbed\nand banks of a river. When a river is in flood, it is at its most powerful, and\nmoves the greatest amount of sediment. This higher force results in the removal\nof sediment and other material from the riverbed and banks of the river, locally\ncausing erosion, transport and, with lower flow, sedimentation downstream.\n","linknr":319,"url":"Hydropower","recorded":1362372151,"links":68,"instances":["hydraulic","physics","timiskaming_district","machine"],"pdf":["http://www.itdg.org/docs/technical_information_service/micro_hydro_power.pdf","http://www.itdg.org/docs/technical_information_service/micro_hydro_power.pdf"],"categories":["Sustainable technologies","Power station technology","Energy conversion","Hydropower|","Hydraulic engineering"],"headings":["History","Hydropower types","Calculating the amount of available power","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/42/SaintAnthonyFalls.jpg/200px-SaintAnthonyFalls.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Hydroelectric_dam.svg/200px-Hydroelectric_dam.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/4/c/94cfcc1dc82a060f518967d9a7dddd5b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/1/0/410c89d20c71e29a025d5f843f0b3462.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/a/2/ca25329b6f1cb50b418137e624c50581.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Wind-turbine-icon.svg/28px-Wind-turbine-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"],["crane","machine"],["montreal_river","timiskaming_district"],["power","physics"],["head","hydraulic"]],"members":["head","power","montreal_river","crane"],"related":["United_States","Power_(physics)","Energy","Irrigation","Watermill","Sawmill","Textile","Crane_(machine)","Elevator","Paint","Hydroelectricity","Trompe","Renewable_energy","Hydrology","Stream_bed","Sediment","Erosion","Sedimentation","Mesopotamia","Ancient_Egypt","Irrigation","Water_clock","Qanat","Turpan_water_system","History_of_India","Water_wheel","Watermill","Roman_Empire","Han_Dynasty","China","Bernard_Forest_de_BÃ©lidor","Electrical_generator","Industrial_Revolution","Hushing","Dolaucothi","Gold_mine","Wales","Spain","Las_Medulas","Great_Britain","Medieval","Lead","Tin","Hydraulic_mining","California_gold_rush","Industrial_revolution","Richard_Arkwright","Water_frame","Blast_furnace","Dyfi_Furnace","Gristmills","Saint_Anthony_Falls","Mississippi_River","Canal","Barge","Inclined_plane_railroad","History_of_Lowell,_Massachusetts","James_B._Francis","Francis_turbine","Lester_Allan_Pelton","Pelton_wheel","Hydraulic_power_network","Victorian_era","United_Kingdom","Geneva","Switzerland","Jet_d'Eau","Compressed_air","Montreal_River_(Timiskaming_District)","Cobalt,_Ontario","Electricity","Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity","Small_hydro","Micro_hydro","Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity","Power_(physics)","Head_(hydraulic)","Rate_of_fluid_flow","ASME","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","Significant_digit","Water_wheel","Kinetic_energy","Streamflow","Environmental_impact_of_reservoirs","Spillway","Hydrological_modelling","Deep_water_source_cooling","International_Hydropower_Association","Marine_energy","Marine_current_power","Osmotic_power","Ocean_thermal_energy","Tidal_power","Wave_power","Low_head_hydro_power"]}
