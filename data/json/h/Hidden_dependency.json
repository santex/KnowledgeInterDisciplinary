{"cursor":"8047","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":\"Hidden dependency\" redirects here.\n'Cognitive dimensions' or 'cognitive dimensions of notations' }}\n}} are design principles for notations, user interfaces and programming\nlanguage design, described by researchers Thomas R.G. Green and Marian Petre.\nThe dimensions can be used to evaluate the usability of an existing information\nartifact, or as heuristics to guide the design of a new one.\n\nCognitive dimensions are designed to provide a lightweight approach to analysis\nof a design quality, rather than an in-depth, detailed description. They provide\na common vocabulary for discussing many factors in notation, UI or programming\nlanguage design. Also, cognitive dimensions help in exploring the space of\npossible designs through design maneuvers, changes intended to improve the\ndesign along one dimension.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Hidden_dependency","recorded":1362543950,"links":12,"instances":["formal","semiotics","computer_programming","desktop_publishing","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~afb21/CognitiveDimensions/CDtutorial.pdf"],"categories":["Usability","Humanâ€“computer interaction","Programming language topics","Notation","User interface techniques"],"headings":["User activities","Design maneuvers","List of the cognitive dimensions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["style_sheet","desktop_publishing"],["abstraction","computer_science#levels_of_abstraction"],["encapsulation","computer_science"],["symbol","formal"],["meaning","semiotics"],["coupling","computer_programming"],["side_effect","computer_science"],["role","computer_science"]],"members":["symbol","meaning","coupling","abstraction","style_sheet","side_effect","encapsulation","role"],"related":["User_interface","Programming_language_theory","Thomas_R.G._Green","Marian_Petre","Usability","Style_sheet_(desktop_publishing)","Encapsulation_(computer_science)","Problem_domain","Learnability","Symbol_(formal)","Meaning_(semiotics)","User_error","Mental_processing","Semantic","Coupling_(computer_programming)","Side_effect_(computer_science)","Temporal_isolation","Feedback","Role_(computer_science)","Secondary_notation","Deutsch_limit","Software_visualization","Cognitive_walkthrough","Homoiconicity"]}
