The song was produced\n  by Tom Rothrock and Jimmy Hogarth and received a mixed reception from music\n  critics. It was released as the first single in the autumn of 2004 and failed\n  to make an impact on the United Kingdom singles chart, peaking well outside\n  the top 75. Following the success of \"You're Beautiful\", \"High\" was re-\n  released in the autumn of 2005, and became a top 20 hit worldwide, charting at\n  number three in Italy and at number 16 in Britain.\n","linknr":181,"url":"High_(James_Blunt_song)","recorded":1362478014,"links":21,"instances":["music","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2004 singles","2005 singles","James Blunt songs","Rock ballads","Pop ballads","Songs written by James Blunt","Songs written by Ricky Ross (musician)"],"headings":["Release","Track listing","Music videos","Chart performance","Charts","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/James_Blunt_-_High_CD_cover.jpg/220px-James_Blunt_-_High_CD_cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/James-Blunt-High-Re-release.jpg/220px-James-Blunt-High-Re-release.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ricky_ross","musician"],["ricky_ross","musician"],["single","music"]],"members":["single","ricky_ross"],"related":["James_Blunt","Back_to_Bedlam","CD_single","Music_download","Los_Angeles","California","Folk_rock","Pop_rock","Atlantic_Records","Custard_Records","Ricky_Ross_(musician)","Tom_Rothrock","You're_Beautiful","Folk_rock","United_Kingdom","James_Blunt","Ricky_Ross_(musician)","Tom_Rothrock","Single_(music)","2004_in_music","You're_Beautiful","2005_in_music","Italy","In_a_Little_While","U2","BBC_Radio_1","United_Kingdom","UK_Singles_Chart","Italy","Austria","Ireland","Switzerland","United_States","Billboard_Hot_100","Canada","Jam!"]}
