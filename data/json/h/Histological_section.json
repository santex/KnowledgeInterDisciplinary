{"cursor":"20437","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n and coverslip, mounted on the stage of a light microscope.]] tissue stained\n with hematoxylin and eosin.]] 'Histology' (compound of the Greek words:\n \"tissue\", and - ) is the study of the microscopic anatomy of cells and tissues\n of plants and animals. It is commonly performed by examining cells and tissues\n by sectioning and staining, followed by examination under a light microscope\n or electron microscope. Histological studies may be conducted via tissue\n culture, where live cells can be isolated and maintained in a proper\n environment outside the body for various research projects. The ability to\n visualize or differentially identify microscopic structures is frequently\n enhanced through the use of histological stains. Histology is an essential\n tool of biology and medicine.\n\n[[Histopathology]], the microscopic study of diseased tissue, is an important\ntool in anatomical pathology, since accurate diagnosis of cancer and other\ndiseases usually requires histopathological examination of samples. Trained\nphysicians, frequently board-certified as pathologists, are the personnel who\nperform histopathological examination and provide diagnostic information based\non their observations.\n\nThe trained scientists who perform the preparation of histological sections are\nhistotechnicians, histology technicians (HT), histology technologists (HTL),\nmedical scientists, medical laboratory technicians, or biomedical scientists.\nTheir field of study is called histotechnology.\n","linknr":838,"url":"Histological_section","recorded":1362671739,"links":87,"instances":["anatomist","chemistry","chtn","anatomy","biology","biology","biology","chemistry","biology","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical
