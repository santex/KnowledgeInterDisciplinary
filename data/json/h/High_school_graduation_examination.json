{"cursor":"6865","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'high school graduation examination' is a test that students must pass to\nreceive a diploma and graduate from high school. These are usually criterion-\nreferenced tests which were implemented as part of a comprehensive standards-\nbased education reform program which sets into place new standards intended to\nincrease the learning of all students.\n\nWhen any test is directly tied to significant consequences, such as determining\nwhether the student may receive a high school diploma, it is called a high-\nstakes test. Many organizations such as the National Council of Teachers of\nMathematics (NCTM) oppose high-stakes tests in general, with the NCTM saying\nthat \"placing too much emphasis on a single test or on testing can undermine the\nquality of education and jeopardize equality of opportunity.\" [http://www.n-\nctm.org/about/position_statements/highstakes.htm] High-Stakes Tests, A Position\nof the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics At the same time,\nalmost all states that require an exit exam for graduation allow students to\ntake the test multiple times and further allow routes to graduation for students\nthat fail.\n\nIn 2011, 24 states required passing a high school exit examination for\ngraduation, and three additional states had legislation instituting such exams\nin the future.
