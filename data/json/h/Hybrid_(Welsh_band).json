They are primarily known as a progressive breaks act,\nalthough they overlap considerably with progressive house and trance. However,\nthe band are now taking a more structured approach to song writing, with the\naddition of Charlotte James contributing to the writing process. The duo are\nconsidered pioneers of the electronic genre, and have produced four studio\nalbums, all garnering critical acclaim. They are known for their cinematic\napproach to their production, specifically with the use of orchestral sounds,\nwhich is particularly notable on their debut album [[Wide Angle]] when they\ncollaborated with the Russian Federal Orchestra. Also over their eleven-year\ncareer, they have produced over 100 remixes for over 40 artists.\n","linknr":494,"url":"Hybrid_(Welsh_band)","recorded":1362543154,"links":20,"instances":["film","dj","hybrid","hybrig_song","2012_film","band","2004_film","musician","hybrid","hybrid_song","song","current_format","band","ep","director","hybrid_song","producer","band","2005","2007_film","remixed","band","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Media
