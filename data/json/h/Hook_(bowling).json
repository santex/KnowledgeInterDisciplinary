{"cursor":"4575","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'hook' in ten-pin bowling is a ball that rolls in a curving pattern (versus\nstraight). The purpose of the hook is to give the ball a better angle at the 1-3\npocket (right-handers) or 1-2 pocket (left-handers.) When a ball is rolled\nstraight, hitting the pocket must be precise. By hooking the ball, the ball will\nhit the pins with more force, producing better carry - especially on the 5-pin\nduring a strike ball. Straight roll - even when it hits the pocket, will tend to\nleave a tap, such as the 5-pin on a light hit, or the 10-pin if the ball was\njust slightly right of the head pin. A hook ball can create strikes with less\nprecise hits at the pocket.\n\nA hook ball can also help the bowler shape the shot on challenging oil patterns.\n\nIn other games of bowling, such as duckpin bowling or candlepin bowling, a hook\nis virtually non-existent for experienced bowlers since the ball is much\nsmaller than in ten-pin bowling, and rolls too fast to the pins to allow a hook\nto develop.\n","linknr":88,"url":"Hook_(bowling)","recorded":1362481520,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bowling"],"headings":["Techniques","Backup ball","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ten-pin_bowling","Duckpin_bowling","Candlepin_bowling","United_States_Bowling_Congress","Bowling","Bowling_Ball","Ten_pin_bowling"]}
