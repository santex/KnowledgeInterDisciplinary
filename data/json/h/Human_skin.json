In humans, it is the largest organ of the integumentary\nsystem. The skin has multiple layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the\nunderlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.\n\"Skin care\" (analysis), Health-Cares.net, 2007, webpage: [http://skin-care.health-cares.net/oily-skin-\ncare.php HCcare].  Human skin is similar to that of most other mammals,\nexcept that it is not protected by a pelt. Though nearly all human skin is\ncovered with hair follicles, it can appear hairless. There are two general types\nof skin, hairy and glabrous skin. Marks, James G; Miller,\nJeffery (2006). Lookingbill and Marks' Principles of Dermatology. (4th ed.).\nElsevier Inc. ISBN 1-4160-3185-5. The adjective 'cutaneous' literally\nmeans \"of the skin\" (from Latin cutis, skin).\n\nBecause it interfaces with the environment, skin plays a key role in protecting\nthe body against pathogens and excessive water\nloss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature\nregulation, sensation, synthesis of vitamin D, and the protection of vitamin B\nfolates. Severely damaged skin will try to heal by forming scar tissue. This is\noften discolored and depigmented.\n\nIn humans, skin pigmentation varies among populations, and skin type can range\nfrom dry to oily. Such skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for\nbacteria which number roughly at 1000 species from 19 phyla. Pappas S. (2009).
