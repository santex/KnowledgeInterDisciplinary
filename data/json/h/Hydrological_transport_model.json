These models generally\ncame into use in the 1960s and 1970s when demand for numerical forecasting of\nwater quality was driven by environmental legislation, and at a similar time\nwidespread access to significant computer power became available. Much of the\noriginal model development took place in the United States and United Kingdom,\nbut today these models are refined and used worldwide.\n\nThere are dozens of different transport models that can be generally grouped by\npollutants addressed, complexity of pollutant sources, whether the model is\nsteady state or dynamic, and time period modeled. Another important designation\nis whether the model is distributed (i.e. capable of predicting multiple points\nwithin a river) or lumped. In a basic model, for example, only one pollutant\nmight be addressed from a simple point discharge into the receiving waters. In\nthe most complex of models, various line source inputs from surface runoff might\nbe added to multiple point sources, treating a variety of chemicals plus\nsediment in a dynamic environment including vertical river stratification and\ninteractions of pollutants with in-stream biota. In addition watershed\ngroundwater may also be included. The model is termed \"physically based\" if its\nparameters can be measured in the field.\n\nOften models have separate modules to address individual steps in the simulation\nprocess. The most common module is a subroutine for calculation of surface\nrunoff, allowing variation in land use type, topography, soil type, vegetative\ncover, precipitation and land management practice (such as the application rate\nof a fertilizer). The concept of hydrological modeling can be extended to other\nenvironments such as the oceans, but most commonly (and in this article) the\nsubject of a river watershed is generally implied.\n","linknr":336,"url":"Hydrological_transport_model","recorded":1362371965,"links":18,"instances":["pollution","mathematics","geography","meteorology","reservoir","ecology","hydrology","nevada","systems"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer-aided engineering software","Environmental chemistry","Environmental soil science","Hydrology","Soil science","Water pollution","Hydrology models"],"headings":["History","Types of hydrological transport models","Model components","Example applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Anjajavyforestrazorback.jpg/240px-Anjajavyforestrazorback.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/ColumbiarivergorgeJRH.jpg/240px-ColumbiarivergorgeJRH.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Lake-tahoe.jpg/240px-Lake-tahoe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["point_source","pollution"],["biota","ecology"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["channel","geography"],["black_box","systems"],["metric","mathematics"],["pyramid_lake","nevada"],["infiltration","hydrology"],["runoff_model","reservoir"]],"members":["point_source","metric","channel","precipitation","runoff_model","biota","infiltration","pyramid_lake","black_box"],"related":["Mathematical_model","Stream_flow","Water_quality","Environmental_legislation","United_States","United_Kingdom","Water_pollution","Receiving_water","Line_source","Surface_runoff","Point_source_(pollution)","Chemical","Sediment","Biota_(ecology)","Drainage_basin","Groundwater","Subroutine","Land_use","Topography","Soil","Vegetation","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Fertilizer","Ocean","Stream_hydrology","Proc._Institute_Civ._Eng.","Event_model","Robert_E._Horton","Surface_runoff","Bull._Geol._Soc._Am.","U.S._Army_Corps_of_Engineers","Stanford_University","Storm_Water_Management_Model","United_States","Journal_of_Hydrology","MIKE_SHE","SHETRAN","MIKE_SHE","Sediment_transport","Differential_equation","Evapotranspiration","Penman-Monteith","Channel_(geography)","Momentum","Sediment","Richards_equation","Darcy's_law","Conservation_of_mass","Land_use","Climate_change","Groundwater","Australia","China","Japan","Italy","Europe","Canada","HBV_hydrology_model","Scandinavia","MOHID_Land","Portugal","Remote_sensing","Geographic_information_system","GSSHA","GSSHA","Engineering","GSSHA","GIS","Vflo","Black_box_(systems)","Rainfall","Surface_runoff","Regression_analysis","Transfer_function","Neural_networks","System_identification","Antecedent_moisture","Surface_runoff","Agriculture","Logging","Surface_runoff","Fertilizer","Pesticide","National_Environmental_Policy_Act","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Clean_Water_Act","ESL_Inc.","Flood","HBV_hydrology_model","Nitrogen","Phosphorus","Suspended_sediment","Lund_University","Sweden","Estonia","Bolivia","Zimbabwe","Nutrient","Nitrogen","Tropical","Semi-arid","Nordic_countries","Drainage_basin","Headwater","Truckee_River","DSSAM_Model","Water_pollution","Land_use","Wastewater","Truckee_River","Reno,_Nevada","Sparks,_Nevada","Lake_Tahoe","Metric_(mathematics)","United_States","Benthic_zone","Alga","Washoe_County,_Nevada","Xeriscape","Endangered_species","Truckee_River","Pyramid_Lake_(Nevada)","Cui-ui","Catostomidae","Lahontan_cutthroat_trout","Aquifer","Differential_equation","HBV_hydrology_model","Hydrometry","Infiltration_(hydrology)","Runoff_model_(reservoir)","SWMM","United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers","WAFLEX","SWAT_model"]}
