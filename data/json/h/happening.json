Happenings take place anywhere, and are\noften multi-disciplinary, with a nonlinear narrative and the active\nparticipation of the audience. Key elements of happenings are planned, but\nartists sometimes retain room for improvisation. This new media art aspect to\nhappenings eliminates the boundary between the artwork and its viewer.\nHenceforth, the interactions between the audience and the artwork makes the\naudience, in a sense, part of the art.\n\nIn the late 1960s, perhaps due to the depiction in films of hippie culture, the\nterm was used much less specifically to mean any gathering of interest, from a\npool hall meetup or a jamming of a few young people to a beer blast or fancy\nformal party.\n",
