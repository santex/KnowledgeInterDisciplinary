It\nconsists of an oxygen and a hydrogen atom held together by a covalent bond, and\ncarries a negative electric charge. It is an important but usually minor\nconstituent of water. It functions as a base, a ligand, a nucleophile and a\ncatalyst. The hydroxide ion forms salts, some of which dissociate in aqueous\nsolution, liberating solvated hydroxide ions. Sodium hydroxide is a multi-million-\nton per annum commodity chemical. A hydroxide attached to a\nstrongly electropositive center may itself dissociate, liberating a hydrogen\ncation (H +), making the parent compound an acid.\n\nThe corresponding electrically neutral compound â¢HO is the hydroxyl radical . The corresponding covalently-bound group -OH of atoms\nis the hydroxyl group. Hydroxide ion and hydroxyl group are nucleophiles and can\nact as a catalyst in organic chemistry.\n\nMany inorganic substances which bear the word \"hydroxide\" in their names are not\nionic compounds of the hydroxide ion, but covalent compounds which contain\nhydroxyl groups.\n","linknr":684,"url":"Hydroxide","recorded":1362482307,"links":77,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/soda_ash/soda_myb05.pdf","http://bastoslab.com/2010/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ed085p83.pdf"],"categories":["Hydroxides|","Bases","Oxoanions","Water
