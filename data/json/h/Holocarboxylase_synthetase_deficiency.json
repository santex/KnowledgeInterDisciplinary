This disorder is classified as a multiple carboxylase\ndeficiency, a group of disorders characterized by impaired activity of certain\nenzymes that depend on biotin. Symptoms are very similar to biotinidase\ndeficiency and treatment â large doses of biotin â is also the same.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Holocarboxylase_synthetase_deficiency","recorded":1362503054,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Autosomal recessive disorders","Vitamin, coenzyme, and cofactor metabolism disorders","Genodermatoses"],"headings":["Diagnosis","Genetics","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Biotin_structure.svg/230px-Biotin_structure.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/220px-Autorecessive.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biotin","Biological_inheritance","Metabolic_disorder","Vitamin","Biotin","Multiple_carboxylase_deficiency","Enzyme","Biotinidase_deficiency","Age_of_onset","Rash","Alopecia","Lethargy","Seizure","Coma","Mutation","Gene","Enzyme","Holocarboxylase_synthetase","B_vitamin","Liver","Egg_yolk","Milk","Protein","Lipid","Carbohydrate","Autosomal_recessive","List_of_cutaneous_conditions"]}
