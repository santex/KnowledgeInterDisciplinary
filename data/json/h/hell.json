Other afterlife destinations include Heaven, Purgatory, Paradise,\nand Limbo.\n\nOther traditions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of\npunishment or reward, merely describe hell as an abode of the dead, a neutral\nplace located under the surface of Earth (for example, see sheol and Hades).\nModern understandings of hells often depict them abstractly, as a state of loss\nrather than as fiery torture literally underground, but this view of the concept\nof a hell can, in fact, be traced back into the ancient and medieval periods as\nwell. Hell is sometimes portrayed as populated with demons who torment those\ndwelling there. Many are ruled by a death god such as Nergal, Hades, Hel, Enma\nor the Devil.\n",
