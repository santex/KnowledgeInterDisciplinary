A molar pregnancy is a\ngestational trophoblastic disease<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/Gestational-\nTrophoblasticDisease/DetailedGuide/gestational-trophoblastic-disease-what-is-g-\nt-d Gestational Trophoblastic Disease] at American Cancer Society. Last Medical\nReview: 04/14/2011</ref> that grows into a mass in the uterus that has swollen\nchorionic villi. These villi grow in clusters that resemble grapes.<ref\nname=\"Merriam Webster\"></ref> A molar pregnancy can develop when an egg that is\nmissing its nucleus is fertilized and that may or may not contain fetal tissue.\nIt is characterized by the presence of a 'hydatidiform mole' (or 'hydatid mole',\n'mola hydatidosa').<ref name=Rob1110></ref> Molar pregnancies are categorized\ninto partial and complete moles. Mole as used here simply indicates clump of\ngrowing tissue, or a 'growth'.\n\nA 'complete mole' is caused by a single (90%) or two (10%) sperm combining with\nan egg which has lost its DNA (the sperm then reduplicates forming a \"complete\"\n46 chromosome set) <ref name=\"Pathologic Basis of Disease\"></ref> The genotype\nis typically 46,XX (diploid) due to subsequent mitosis of the fertilizing sperm,\nbut can also be 46,XY (diploid).<ref name=\"Pathologic Basis of Disease\"></ref>\n46,YY (diploid) is not observed. In contrast, a 'partial mole' occurs when an\negg is fertilized by two sperm or by one sperm which reduplicates itself\nyielding the genotypes of 69,XXY (triploid) or 92,XXXY (tetraploid).<ref\nname=\"Pathologic Basis of Disease\"/> Complete hydatidiform moles have a higher\nrisk of developing into choriocarcinoma — a malignant tumor of trophoblast cells\n— than do partial moles.\n\nThe etymology is derived from hydatisia (Greek \"a drop of water\"), referring to\nthe watery contents of the cysts, and mole (from Latin mola = millstone/false\nconception).<ref>Entries HYDATID n. (a.) and MOLE, n.<sup>6</sup> in the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary online. (http://dictionary.oed.com/ &mdash; subscription\nrequired.)</ref> The term, however, comes from the similar appearance of the\ncyst to a hydatid cyst in an Echinococcosis.<ref>http://medical-\ndictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hydatidiform</ref>\n\nA hydatidiform mole conception may be categorized in medical terms as one type\nof non-induced (natural) \"missed abortion\"<ref></ref> - referred to colloquially\nas a \"missed miscarriage\", because the pregnancy has become non-viable\n(miscarried) but was not immediately expelled (therefore was \"missed\").\n",
