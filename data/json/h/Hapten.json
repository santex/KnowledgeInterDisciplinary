(In general, only large molecules,\ninfectious agents, or insoluble foreign matter can elicit an immune response in\nthe body.) Once the body has generated antibodies to a hapten-carrier adduct,\nthe small-molecule hapten may also be able to bind to the antibody, but it will\nusually not initiate an immune response; usually only the hapten-carrier adduct\ncan do this. Sometimes the small-molecule hapten can even block immune response\nto the hapten-carrier adduct by preventing the adduct from binding to the\nantibody, a process called hapten inhibition.\n\nThe mechanisms of absence of immune response may vary and involve complex\nimmunological mechanisms, but can include absent or insufficient co-stimulatory\nsignals from antigen-presenting cells.\n\nThe concept of haptens emerged from the work of Karl Landsteiner {{cite book\n| last=Landsteiner first=Karl title=The Specificity of Serological Reactions\n| publisher=Harvard Univ.
