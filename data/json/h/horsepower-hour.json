      "text" : "A 'Horsepower-hour' (hph) is an outdated unit of energy, not used in the SI\nsystem of units. The unit represents an amount of work a horse is supposed\ncapable of delivering during an hour (a horsepower integrated over a time\ninterval of an hour). Based on differences in the definition of what constitutes\nthe 'power of a horse', a horsepower-hour differs slightly from the German\n\"Pferdestärkenstunde\" (PSh):\n\n:1.014 PSh = 1 hph = 1,980,000 lb·ft = 0.7457 kWh.\n\n:1 PSh = 0.73549875 kWh = 2647.7955 kJ (exactly by definition)\n\nThe horsepower-hour is still used in the railroad industry when sharing motive\npower (locomotives.) For example, if railroad A borrows a 2,500 horsepower\nlocomotive from Railroad B and operates it for twelve hours, Railroad A owes a\ndebt of (2,500 * 12) 30,000 horsepower-hours. Railroad A may repay the debt by\nloaning Railroad B a 3,000 horsepower locomotive for ten\nhours.<ref>http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&id=4172</ref>\n",
