He settled in Victoria,\nBritish Columbia where he found work as a bookkeeper for the Victoria Brewing\nCompany eventually becoming manager of the company even though he was a tea-\ntotaller. [http://www.webturf.com/oakbay/history/encyclopedia/a.shtml Herbert\nAnscomb], Oak Bay Encyclopedia\n\nIn 1925 he was elected reeve of Oak Bay and in 1928 he became mayor of Victoria\nserving until 1931.\n\nAnscomb entered provincial politics and was elected to the British Columbia\nLegislative Assembly in the 1933 provincial election as an Independent (the\nConservatives had decided not to run in the election) and re-elected in 1937 as\na Conservative. The Conservatives joined the ruling Liberals to form a coalition\ngovernment led by John Hart following the 1941 provincial election. Following the death of Conservative leader Royal Lethington Maitland\nin 1946 Anscomb became Conservative leader and Deputy Premier as well as Finance\nMinister. Hans J. Michelmann, David E. Smith, Cristine De Clercy\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=d7iLYjWHvS8C&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=herbert+an-\nscomb+conservative&source=web&ots=KTErt15MJo&sig=5RoPyZ9ETqJHuxFIwKJGsSzGsG4#PP-\nA184,M1 Continuity And Change in Canadian Politics: Essays in Honour of David E.\nSmith], University of Toronto Press (2006), page 184 A fiscal\nconservative, Anscomb introduced British Columbia's provincial sales tax at a\nrate of 3% in 1948. When Hart retired in 1947 the Conservatives\nwanted Anscomb to succeed him as Premier of British Columbia but the Liberals\nhad more seats in the legislature and insisted that the Premier should remain a\nLiberal resulting in the appointment of Byron Johnson as premier. The conflict\nstrained relations between Johnson and Anscomb and their parties in the\nsubsequent coalition. The Conservatives were riven into three factions, one led\nby W.A.C. Bennett called for the Tories and Liberals to fuse into a single\nparty, a second faction supported the status quo and a third wanted the\nConservatives to leave the coalition. The Liberals, meanwhile, began to doubt\nthe need to continue the coalition rather than govern on their own. The\ncoalition was re-elected in the 1949 provincial election winning 39 seats\nagainst 7 for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation opposition. Growing\ndivisions within the Conservative Party resulted in Anscomb's leadership and the\nparty's continuation in the coalition being unsuccessfully challenged at the\n1950 party convention. W.A.C. Bennett, who was now in the anti-coalition\nfaction, quit the party and crossed the floor to join and eventually led the\nBritish Columbia Social Credit Party.\n\nIn October 1951, the Liberal Party decided to dissolve the coalition and Premier\nJohnson dismissed his Conservative ministers including Anscomb and continued as\na minority government with Anscomb as Leader of the Opposition beginning in\nFebruary 1952. The government soon collapsed and in the ensuing 1952 provincial\nelection the Liberals were reduced to 6 seats, the Conservatives to 4 and\nJohnson and Anscomb both lost their seats while the Social Credit Party was able\nto form a government under Bennett that would rule the province for the next two\ndecades.\n","linknr":146,"url":"Herbert_Anscomb","recorded":1375075450,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Anscomb&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Anscomb&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","#cite_note-1","/wiki/British_Columbia","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Tea-totaller","#cite_note-oak-2","/wiki/Reeve_(Canada)","/wiki/Mayor","#cite_note-oak-2","/wiki/British_Columbia_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1933","/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/Coalition_government","/wiki/John_Hart_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1941","#cite_note-oak-2","/wiki/Royal_Lethington_Maitland","#cite_note-con-3","/wiki/Sales_tax","#cite_note-oak-2","/wiki/Premier_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/Boss_Johnson","/wiki/W.A.C._Bennett","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1949","/wiki/British_Columbia_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Crossed_the_floor","/wiki/British_Columbia_Social_Credit_Party","#cite_note-con-3","/wiki/Minority_government","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(British_Columbia)","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1952","#cite_note-con-3","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Anscomb&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://pilot.familysearch.org/recordsearch/start.html#p=recordimage&c=fs:1538285&r=r_408634718&pn=p1","#cite_ref-oak_2-0","#cite_ref-oak_2-1","#cite_ref-oak_2-2","#cite_ref-oak_2-3","http://www.webturf.com/oakbay/history/encyclopedia/a.shtml","#cite_ref-con_3-0","#cite_ref-con_3-1","#cite_ref-con_3-2","http://books.google.com/books?id=d7iLYjWHvS8C&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=herbert+anscomb+conservative&source=web&ots=KTErt15MJo&sig=5RoPyZ9ETqJHuxFIwKJGsSzGsG4#PPA184,M1","/wiki/Template:BC_Con_Leaders","/wiki/Template_talk:BC_Con_Leaders","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:BC_Con_Leaders&action=edit","/wiki/British_Columbia_Conservative_Party","/wiki/Charles_Wilson_(British_Columbia_politician)","/wiki/Richard_McBride","/wiki/William_John_Bowser","/wiki/Robert_Henry_Pooley","/wiki/Simon_Fraser_Tolmie","/wiki/Frank_Porter_Patterson","/wiki/Royal_Lethington_Maitland","/wiki/Deane_Finlayson","/wiki/Davie_Fulton","/w/index.php?title=John_Anthony_St._Etienne_DeWolf&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Derril_Thomas_Warren&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/George_Scott_Wallace","/w/index.php?title=Victor_Albert_Stephens&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Brian_Westwood&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Peter_Pollen","/w/index.php?title=Peter_B._Macdonald&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=David_Maurice_Mercier&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Susan_Power_(politician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Kenneth_Edgar_King&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Barry_Chilton&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wilf_Hanni","/wiki/John_Cummins_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Anscomb&oldid=510818059","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1892_births","/wiki/Category:1972_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_Columbia_Conservative_Party_leaders","/wiki/Category:British_Columbia_Conservative_Party_MLAs","/wiki/Category:British_Columbia_Finance_Ministers","/wiki/Category:Mayors_of_Victoria,_British_Columbia","/wiki/Category:English_emigrants_to_Canada","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Herbert+Anscomb&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Herbert+Anscomb","/wiki/Herbert_Anscomb","/wiki/Talk:Herbert_Anscomb","#","/wiki/Herbert_Anscomb","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Anscomb&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Anscomb&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wiki
