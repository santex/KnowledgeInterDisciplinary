The crush resulted\nin the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since\nbeen blamed primarily on the police. The incident remains the worst stadium-\nrelated disaster in British history and one of the world's worst football\ndisasters.\n\nFootball clubs used to contest the semi-final of the FA Cup at a neutral venue,\nand in 1989 Hillsborough was selected by the Football Association. While\nopposing supporters were segregated in the stadium, Liverpool fans were\nallocated the Leppings Lane stand, reached by a limited number of\nturnstiles. Entry to the ground was slow due to\nthe few decrepit turnstiles available to the Liverpool fans which caused\ndangerous overcrowding outside the ground before kick-off. In an attempt to ease\npressure outside the ground, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield ordered an exit\ngate to be opened. The opened exit gate led to a tunnel marked \"Standing\" which\nled directly to the two already overcrowded enclosures (pens). In previous years\nthe tunnel had been closed off by police when the two central pens were full,\nhowever on this occasion the tunnel was unmanned.\n\nThe ensuing influx of supporters caused crushing and some fans climbed over side\nfences or were lifted by fellow supporters onto the stand above to escape the\ncrush. Moments after kick-off, a crush barrier broke and fans began to fall on\ntop of each other. The game was stopped after six minutes. To carry away the\ninjured, supporters tore down advertising hoardings to use as stretchers and\nemergency services were called to provide assistance. Of the 96 people who died,\n14 were admitted to hospital. When the FA Chairman visited the Control Box to\nfind out what had happened, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told a 'disgraceful\nlie' Scrutiny of Evidence relating to the Hillsborough football stadium\ndisaster, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, February 1998, Page 83,http://www.southyor-\nks.police.uk/sites/default/files/STUART%20SMITH%20ENQUIRY%20REPORT.pdf\nthat the supporters had \"rushed\" the gate.\n\nThe 1990 official inquiry into the disaster, the [[Taylor Report]], concluded\n\"the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control.\" The findings of the report resulted in the\nelimination of standing terraces at all major football stadiums in England,\nWales and Scotland.\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of the disaster, government minister Andy Burnham called\nfor the police, ambulance and all other public agencies to release documents\nwhich were not made available to Lord Justice Taylor in 1989.

Retrieved 12\nSeptember 2012. This action led to the formation of the Hillsborough\nIndependent Panel, which in September 2012 concluded that no Liverpool fans were\nresponsible for the deaths, and that attempts had been made by the authorities\nto conceal what happened, including the alteration by police of 116 statements\nrelating to the disaster.

Retrieved 12 September 2012. The facts in the\nreport prompted immediate apologies from Prime Minister David Cameron; the Chief\nConstable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton; Football Association\nChairman David Bernstein and Kelvin MacKenzie, then-editor of [[The Sun (United\nKingdom)|The Sun]], for their organisations' respective roles. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-\n19570810 \"Hillsborough files released: As it happened\"]. BBC News. Retrieved 12\nSeptember 2012.\n\nIn September 2012, the Hillsborough Independent Panel concluded that up to\n41 of the 96 fatalities might have been avoided had they received prompt\nmedical treatment.  The report revealed \"multiple failures\" by\nother emergency services and public bodies which contributed to the death\ntoll. In response to the panel's report, Attorney General for England and\nWales, Dominic Grieve MP, confirmed he would consider all the new evidence\nto evaluate whether the original inquest verdicts of accidental death could\nbe overturned. On 19 December 2012, a new inquest was granted in\nthe High Court, to the relief of the families and friends of the\nHillsborough deceased.\n","linknr":1264,"url":"Hillsborough_disaster","recorded":1375066403,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_disaster&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_disaster&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Hillsborough_disaster_main.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Hillsborough_disaster_main.jpg/250px-Hillsborough_disaster_main.jpg","/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium","/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium","/wiki/Sheffield","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Hillsborough_disaster&params=53.41154_N_1.50154_W_","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Hillsborough_disaster&params=53.41154_N_1.50154_W_","/wiki/Taylor_Report","/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium","/wiki/Sheffield","/wiki/FA_Cup","/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.","/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Neutral_venue","/wiki/Football_Association","#cite_note-BBC_14_April_2009-2","/wiki/Billboard","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Taylor_Report","#cite_note-Taylor_Interim_Report-4","/wiki/Terrace_(stadium)","/wiki/Andy_Burnham","/wiki/Peter_Taylor,_Baron_Taylor_of_Gosforth","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Hillsborough_Independent_Panel","#cite_note-hip_report-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/David_Cameron","/wiki/Chief_Constable","/wiki/South_Yorkshire_Police","/wiki/Kelvin_MacKenzie","/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Attorney_General_for_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Dominic_Grieve","#cite_note-10","#Before_the_disaster","#The_venue","#Warning_signs","#The_Disaster","#Build-up","#The_crush","#Aftermath","#Reactions","#Disaster_Appeal_Fund","#Effect_on_survivors","#The_Taylor_inquiry","#Police_control","#Aggravating_factors","#Police_evasion","#Effect_on_stadia_in_Britain","#Stuart-Smith_scrutiny","#Hillsborough_Independent_Panel","#History_of_the_panel","#Findings","#Effects","#Memorials","#Permanent_memorials","#Memorial_ceremonies","#Tenth_anniversary","#Twentieth_anniversary","#Tributes_from_other_clubs","#Charges_against_officials","#Inquests","#Prosecution","#Psychiatric_injury_and_other_litigation","#Controversies","#The_Sun","#Edward_Pearce","#FHM","#EastEnders","#Charles_Itandje","#Jeremy_Hunt","#Alan_Davies_podcast_comments","#Fans.27_chants","#Oliver_Popplewell","#David_Crompton","#Hillsborough_television_drama","#Further_reading","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_disaster&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Sheffield_Wednesday_FC.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Sheffield_Wednesday_FC.jpg/220px-Sheffield_Wednesday_FC.jpg","/wiki/File:Sheffield_Wednesday_FC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium","/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_disaster&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.","/wiki/Pitch_(sports_field)","/wiki/Football_hooliganism","#cite_note-Before_Hillsborough-11","#cite_note-Major_Accidents-12","/wiki/Green_Guide","#cite_note-hip_report-6","/wiki/Oliver_Popplewell","/wiki/Bradford_City_stadium_fire","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-14","/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_disaster&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.","/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.","#cite_note-taylor_21-15","/wiki/Bert_McGee","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Coventry_City","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Leeds_United","#cite_note-19","/wiki/Minister_for_Sport_and_the_Olympics","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-21","/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_disaster&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Hillsborough_disaster&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/File:Hillsborough_Stadium_Plan.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Hillsborough_Stadium_Plan.png/220px-Hillsborough_Stadium_Plan.png","/wiki/File:Hillsborough_Stadium_Plan.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Turnstile","#cite_note-taylor_5-22","/wiki/Football_Specials","#cite_note-taylor_9-23","/wiki/Pennines","/wiki/M62_motorway","#cite_note-taylor_34-24","#cite_note-taylor_11-25","#cite_note-taylor_12-26","/wiki/File:Hillsborough_disaster_outside.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/23/Hillsborough_d
