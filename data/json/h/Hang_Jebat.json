{"cursor":"3143","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Hang Jebat' (Jawi: 'ÙÚ  Ø¬ÙØ¨Øª') was the closest companion of the legendary\nMelakan hero Hang Tuah. Regarded in Malaysia as one of the greatest silat\nexponents in history, he is well known for his vengeful rebellion against the\nMalacca Sultan whom he served. He can also be regarded as an early Malay\nanarchist following his rebellion against the ruler.\n\nAfter Hang Tuah was sentenced to death, Hang Jebat was conferred the coveted\nTaming Sari kris, a weapon formerly used by Hang Tuah. Believing that Hang Tuah\nwas unjustly murdered by the sultan he served, Hang Jebat turned against the\nruler to avenge his friend's death. No one knew that the bendahara (chief\nminister) went against the royal decree and hid Hang Tuah in a remote area..\n\nWith the kris in his possession, Hang Jebat was undefeatable and there was not\none person in the palace who was capable of killing him. Hang Jebat's revenge\nallegedly became a palace killing spree or furious rebellion against the sultan\n(sources differ as to what actually occurred). It remains consistent, however,\nthat Hang Jebat wreaked havoc onto the royal court, and the sultan was unable to\nstop him, as none of the warriors dared to challenge the more ferocious and\nskilled Hang Jebat.\n\nAfter learning from the bendahara that Hang Tuah was still alive, the sultan\nhad him recall the warrior and gave him full amnesty. The sultan then ordered\nHang Tuah to kill Hang Jebat. Being unquestioningly loyal to the ruler, Hang\nTuah obeyed the sultan's bidding and went on to challenge Hang Jebat. After\nfighting in a battle that lasted for seven days, Hang Tuah eventually managed\nto reclaim the Taming Sari by tricking Hang Jebat. Although stabbed by Tuah,\nHang Jebat bandaged his wounds and ran amok in the city square for three days,\nkilling thousands of people before retreating to Tuah's house and dying in his\nfriend's arms.\n\nHang Jebat's famous quote during the fight was \"Raja adil raja disembah, raja\nzalim raja disanggah\" meaning \"A fair king is a king to salute, a cruel king is\na king to rebel against\". This went against Tuah's philosophy of loyalty\nwithout question.\n\nAfter the fight, the sultan ordered his men to tear down, burn and throw the\nashes of the house into the sea. Two months later, when a lady of the\nbendahara's retinue gave birth to Jebat's son, the sultan ordered Hang Tuah to\nthrow the baby into the sea as well. Instead, the laksamana entrusted the child,\nHang Nadim, to the bendahara.\n\nA Royal Malaysian Navy Lekiu class frigate is named after him: F29 KD Jebat. The\nrecently decommissioned frigate F24 KD Rahmat was to be called KD Hang Jebat,\nbut engine problems during builders trails caused the Royal Malaysian Navy to\nchange her name to F24 KD Rahmat. One of the oldest engines that pulls the\ntrains along the Singapore-Malaysia rail route is also named after him.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Hang_Jebat","recorded":1375073174,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Jawi_script","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Silat","/wiki/Sultanate_of_Malacca","/wiki/Anarchist","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Taming_Sari","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","/wiki/Amok","/wiki/Bendahara","/wiki/Laksamana","/wiki/Royal_Malaysian_Navy","/wiki/Lekiu","/wiki/Frigate","/wiki/Frigate","/wiki/KD_Rahmat","/wiki/Royal_Malaysian_Navy","/wiki/KD_Rahmat","/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Hang_Tuah","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&oldid=560286481","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:History_of_Malacca","/wiki/Category:People_from_Malacca","/wiki/Category:Malay_culture","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hang+Jebat&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hang+Jebat","/wiki/Hang_Jebat","/wiki/Talk:Hang_Jebat","#","/wiki/Hang_Jebat","/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Hang_Jebat","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Hang_Jebat","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&oldid=560286481","/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1089371","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Hang_Jebat&id=560286481","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Hang+Jebat","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Hang+Jebat&oldid=560286481&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Hang_Jebat&printable=yes","//id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Jebat","//ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Jebat","//zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B1%89%E6%83%B9%E6%8B%94","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1089371#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Jebat","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["History
