Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around\n| a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A,\n| H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the\n| interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to\n| form higher order chromatin structures. This gene encodes a member of the\n| histone H2A family. Several transcripts have been identified for this\n| gene.\n}}\n","linknr":203,"url":"H2AFV","recorded":1362481031,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Protein_H2AFV_PDB_1f66.png/250px-Protein_H2AFV_PDB_1f66.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/PBB_GE_H2AFV_212205_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_H2AFV_212205_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/PBB_GE_H2AFV_202487_s_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_H2AFV_202487_s_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/PBB_GE_H2AFV_212206_s_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_H2AFV_212206_s_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/PDB_1f66_EBI.jpg/180px-PDB_1f66_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene"]}
