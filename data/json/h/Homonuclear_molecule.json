{"cursor":"1468","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Homonuclear molecules', or 'homonuclear species', are molecules composed of\nonly one type of element. Homonuclear molecules may consist of various numbers\nof atoms, depending on the element's properties. Some elements form molecules of\nmore than one size. Noble gases rarely form bonds, so they only have one atom.\nThe most familiar homonuclear molecules are diatomic, meaning they consist of\ntwo atoms, though not all diatomic molecules are homonuclear. Homonuclear\ndiatomic molecules include hydrogen (H 2), oxygen (O 2),\nnitrogen (N 2) and all of the halogens. Oxygen, in addition to its\ndiatomic form, also forms the homonuclear triatomic molecule, ozone\n(O 3). Homonuclear tetratomic molecules include arsenic\n(As 4) and phosphorus (P 4). Sulfur forms diatomic, and\noctatomic homonuclear molecules (S 2, S 6, S 8),\nthough the first two are rare. The element carbon is known to have a number of\nhomonuclear molecules, the best known being buckminsterfullerene or \"buckyball\"\n(C 60 ).\n","linknr":100,"url":"Homonuclear_molecule","recorded":1362512652,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecules","Chemical element groups"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Molecule","Chemical_element","Atom","Noble_gas","Diatomic","Atom","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Halogen","Ozone","Arsenic","Phosphorus","Sulfur","Diatomic_element","Octatomic_element","Carbon","Buckminsterfullerene","Heteronuclear_molecule","Allotropy"]}
