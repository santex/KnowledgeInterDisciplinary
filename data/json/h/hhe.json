It was developed by NIOSH to comply with a mandate included in the\nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to investigate occupational hazards\nreported by workers. According to Section 20(a)(6) of the Act, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services is authorized \"following a written request by any\nemployer or authorized representative of employees, to determine whether any\nsubstance normally found in the place of employment has potentially toxic\neffects in such concentrations as used or found.\" <ref>Occupational Safety and\nHealth Act (Public Law 91-596, 91st Congress, S.2193, December 29, 1970), 29 USC\n669 (a)(6).

Accessed May 8, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe level of aid offered via the HHE program ranges from written correspondence\nbetween NIOSH and the inquiring party and a site visit from a NIOSH\nrepresentative. Following each site visit, NIOSH provides a report detailing the\nhazards found and outlining remediation recommendations. The final report is\ngiven to the requester, the employer, employee representatives, OSHA, and other\nappropriate agencies. The employer is required to post the final report;\nhowever, NIOSH has no authority to force the employer to comply with the\nrecommendations stated in it.<ref\nname=about>[http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/HHEprogram.html Health Hazard\nEvaluations].
