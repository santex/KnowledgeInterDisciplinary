{"cursor":"5272","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Heterogeneous Element Processor (HEP)' was introduced by Denelcor, Inc. in\n1982 as the world's first commercial MIMD computer. The HEP's architect was\nBurton Smith. A HEP system, as the name implies, was pieced together from many\nheterogeneous components -- processors, data memory modules, and I/O modules.\nThe components were connected via a switched network.\n\nA single processor, called a PEM, in a HEP system (up to sixteen PEMs could be\nconnected) was rather unconventional; via a \"program status word (PSW) queue,\"\nup to fifty processes could be maintained in hardware at once. The largest\nsystem ever delivered had 4 PEMs. The eight-stage instruction pipeline allowed\ninstructions from eight different processes to proceed at once. In fact, only\none instruction from a given process was allowed to be present in the pipeline\nat any point in time. Therefore, the full processor throughput of 10 MIPS could\nonly be achieved when eight or more processes were active; no single process\ncould achieve throughput greater than 1.25 MIPS. This type of multithreading\nprocessing classifies the 'HEP' as a barrel processor. The hardware\nimplementation of the HEP PEM was emitter coupled logic.\n\nProcesses were classified as either user-level or supervisor-level. User-level\nprocesses could create supervisor-level processes, which were used to manage user-\nlevel processes and perform I/O. Processes of the same class were required to be\ngrouped into one of seven user tasks and seven supervisor tasks.\n\nEach processor, in addition to the PSW queue and instruction pipeline, contained\ninstruction memory, 2,048 64-bit general purpose registers and 4,096 constant\nregisters. Constant registers were differentiated by the fact that only\nsupervisor processes could modify their contents. Interestingly, the processors\nthemselves contained no data memory; instead, data memory modules could be\nseparately attached to the switched network.\n\nThe HEP memory consisted of completely separate instruction memory (up to 128\nMBs) and data memory (up to 1 GB). Users saw 64-bit words, but in reality, these\nwords were 72-bit with the extra bits used for state, see next paragraph,\nparity, tagging, and other uses.\n\nThe HEP implemented a type of mutual exclusion in which all registers and\nlocations in data memory had associated \"empty\" and \"full\" states. Reading from\na location set the state to \"empty,\" while writing to it set the state to\n\"full.\" A programmer could allow processes to halt after trying to read from an\nempty location or write to a full location, enforcing critical sections.\n\nThe switched network between elements resembled, in many ways, a modern computer\nnetwork. On the network were sets of nodes, each of which had three links. When\na packet arrived at a node, it consulted a routing table and attempted to\nforward the packet closer to its destination. If a node became congested, any\nincoming packets were passed on without routing. Packets treated in such a\nmanner had their priority level increased; when several packets vied for a\nsingle node, a packet with a higher priority level would be routed before ones\nwith lower priority levels.\n\nThe HEP's primary application programming language was unique Fortran variant.\nIn time C, Pascal, and SISAL were added. The syntax of data variables using full-\nempty bits prepended '$' before their name. So 'A' would name a local variable,\nbut $A would be a locking full-empty variable. Application dead-lock was thus\npossible. Problematic, failure to '$' could introduce unintended numerical\ninaccuracy.\n\nThe first HEP operating system was HEPOS. Mike Muuss was involved in a Unix\nport for the Ballistics Research Laboratory. HEPOS was not a Unix-like\noperating system.\n\nAlthough it was known to have poor cost-performance, the HEP received attention\ndue to what were, at the time, several revolutionary features. The HEP had the\nperformance of a CDC 7600-class computer in the Cray-1 era. HEP systems were\nacquired by Los Alamos, the Argonne National Laboratory, the Ballistic Research\nLaboratory, probably the National Security Agency, and Germany's Messerschmitt\nwhich had the only 4 processor PEM system. Messerschmitt was the only client to\nput the HEP into use for \"real\" applications; the other clients used it for\nexperimenting with parallel algorithms. The HEP attracted widespread attention\ndespite its terrible cost performance because of its many interesting hardware\nfeatures that attempted to facilitate performance.\n\nFaster and larger designs for HEP-2 and HEP-3 were started but never completed.\nThe architectural concept would later be embodied with code-named Horizon.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Heterogeneous_Element_Processor","recorded":1364190715,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/w/index.php?title=Denelcor,_Inc.&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/MIMD","/wiki/Burton_Smith","/wiki/Heterogeneous","/wiki/Central_processing_unit","/wiki/Packet_switching","/wiki/Computer_process","/wiki/Instruction_pipeline","/wiki/Million_instructions_per_second","/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)","/wiki/Barrel_processor","/wiki/Emitter_coupled_logic","/wiki/Processor_register","/wiki/Mutual_exclusion","/wiki/Fortran","/wiki/C_(programming_language)","/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)","/wiki/SISAL","/wiki/Mike_Muuss","/wiki/Unix","/wiki/Ballistics_Research_Laboratory","/wiki/CDC_7600","/wiki/Cray-1","/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory","/wiki/Argonne_National_Laboratory","/wiki/National_Security_Agency","/wiki/Messerschmitt_AG","/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)","/wiki/Hyper-threading","/wiki/Cray_MTA","/wiki/Tera_Computer","/wiki/VLIW","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&oldid=543782356","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Parallel_computing","/w/index.php?title=Category:Supercomputer&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_September_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Heterogeneous+Element+Processor&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Heterogeneous+Element+Processor","/wiki/Heterogeneous_Element_Processor","/wiki/Talk:Heterogeneous_Element_Processor","#","/wiki/Heterogeneous_Element_Processor","/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Heterogeneous_Element_Processor","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Heterogeneous_Element_Processor","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&oldid=543782356","/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&id=543782356","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Heterogeneous+Element+Processor","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Heterogeneous+Element+Processor&oldid=543782356&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Heterogeneous_Element_Processor&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_Element_Processor","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Heterogeneous
