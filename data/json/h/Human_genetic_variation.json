There may be multiple variants of any given gene in the human\npopulation (genes), leading to polymorphism. Many genes are not polymorphic,\nmeaning that only a single allele is present in the population: the gene is then\nsaid to be fixed. When all genes are fixed within a population, so every\nmember of the population is genetically identical, the population is said to be\nclonal. This occurs in species that reproduce asexually.\n\nNo two humans are genetically identical. Even monozygotic twins, who develop\nfrom one zygote, have infrequent genetic differences due to mutations occurring\nduring development and gene copy number variation. {{cite journal\n|last1=Bruder |first1=CEG |coauthors=et al. |year=2008 |title=Phenotypically\nConcordant and Discordant Monozygotic Twins Display Different DNA Copy-Number-\nVariation Profiles |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=82\n|issue=3 |pages=763 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.12.011 }} Differences between\nindividuals, even closely related individuals, are the key to techniques such as\ngenetic fingerprinting. Alleles occur at different frequencies in different\nhuman populations, with populations that are more geographically and ancestrally\nremote tending to differ more.\n\nCauses of differences between individuals include the exchange of genes during\nmeiosis and various mutational events. There are at least two reasons why\ngenetic variation exists between populations. Natural selection may confer an\nadaptive advantage to individuals in a specific environment if an allele\nprovides a competitive advantage. Alleles under selection are likely to occur\nonly in those geographic regions where they confer an advantage. The second main\ncause of genetic variation is due to the high degree of neutrality of most\nmutations. Most mutations do not appear to have any selective effect one way or\nthe other on the organism. The main cause is genetic drift, this is the effect\nof random changes in the gene pool. In humans, founder effect and past small\npopulation size (increasing the likelihood of genetic drift) may have had an\nimportant influence in neutral differences between populations. The theory that\nhumans recently migrated out of Africa supports this.\n\nThe study of human genetic variation has both evolutionary significance and\nmedical applications. It can help scientists understand ancient human population\nmigrations as well as how different human groups are biologically related to one\nanother. For medicine, study of human genetic variation may be important because\nsome disease-causing alleles occur more often in people from specific geographic\nregions. New findings show that each human has on average 60 new mutations\ncompared to their parents. {{cite web |title=We are all mutants: First\ndirect whole-genome measure of human mutation predicts 60 new mutations in each\nof us |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/06/110613012758.htm\n|publisher=Science Daily |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-05 }}\n{{cite journal |last1=Conrad |first1=DF |coauthors=et al. |year=2011\n|title=Variation in genome-wide mutation rates within and between human families\n|journal=Nature Genetics |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=712â4 |doi=10.1038/ng.862\n|pmc=3322360 |pmid=21666693 }} Apart from mutations, many genes that may\nhave aided humans in ancient times plague humans today. For example, it is\nsuspected that genes that allow humans to more efficiently process food are\nthose that make people susceptible to obesity and diabetes
