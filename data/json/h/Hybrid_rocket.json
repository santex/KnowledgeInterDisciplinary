{"cursor":"18144","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" detail of SpaceShipOne\n ([http://scaled.com/projects/tierone/data_sheets/html/ox_tank.htm more\n information]).]]\n\nA 'hybrid rocket' is a rocket with a rocket motor which uses propellants in two\ndifferent states of matter - one solid and the other either gas or liquid. The\nHybrid rocket concept can be traced back at least 75 years.\n\nHybrid rockets exhibit advantages over both liquid rockets and solid rockets\nespecially in terms of simplicity, safety, and cost. Because it is\nnearly impossible for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being\ndifferent states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than\nliquids or solids. Like liquid rockets and unlike solid rockets they can be shut\ndown easily and are simply throttle-able. The theoretical specific\nimpulse( I_{sp} ) performance of hybrids is generally higher than\nsolids and roughly equivalent to hydrocarbon-based liquids. I_{sp}\nas high as 400s has been measured in a hybrid rocket using metalized\nfuels. Hybrid systems are slightly more complex than solids, but the\nsignificant hazards of manufacturing, shipping and handling solids offset the\nsystem simplicity advantages.\n","linknr":348,"url":"Hybrid_rocket","recorded":1362543243,"links":26,"instances":["current_format","matter","rocket"],"pdf":["http://www.stanford.edu/dept/aeroastro/aeroastro/50th/posters/peregrine.pdf"],"categories":["Spacecraft propulsion","Rocketry"],"headings":["Basic concepts","Properties","Hybrid safety","Operational hybrids","Organizations working on hybrids","In popular culture","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/SpaceShipOne_schematic.png/220px-SpaceShipOne_schematic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/3/f2387a900468f2d30e2adde062197bf5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/3/f2387a900468f2d30e2adde062197bf5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Hybrids_big.png/220px-Hybrids_big.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/3/f2387a900468f2d30e2adde062197bf5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/3/f2387a900468f2d30e2adde062197bf5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/3/f2387a900468f2d30e2adde062197bf5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["barbarella","rocket"],["mythbusters","2005_season#episode_40_â€“_\"confederate_rocket\""],["top_gear","current_format"]],"members":["mythbusters","top_gear","phase","barbarella"],"related":["SpaceShipOne","Rocket","Rocket_motor","Propellants","Liquid-fuel_rocket","Solid_rocket","Liquid-fuel_rocket","Challenger_disaster","Specific_impulse","Hydrocarbon","PEPCON_disaster","Pressure_vessel","Rocket_propellant","Combustion_chamber","Rocket_propellant","Combustion","Boundary_layer","Diffusion_flame","Oxidizer","Fuel","HTPB","Paraffin_wax","Aluminium","Lithium","Metal_hydrides","Oxygen","Nitrous_oxide","Polymers","Polyethylene","Cross-link","Rubbers","HTPB","Liquid-fuel_rocket","Solid_rocket","Phase_(matter)","Magnesium","Lithium","Beryllium","Specific_impulse","Liquid_oxygen","Nitrous_oxide","Research_and_development","Nitrous_oxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","Oxygen","Nitrogen_tetroxide","Nitrous_oxide","TNT_equivalent","Solid_rocket","Liquid-fuel_rocket","SpaceDev","American_Rocket_Company","SpaceShipOne","HTPB","Nitrous_oxide","Scaled_Composites","SpaceDev_Streaker","SpaceDev_Dream_Chaser","Nitrous_oxide","HTPB","Sierra_Nevada_Corporation","Commercial_Crew_Development","Space_Propulsion_Group","Orbital_Technologies_Corporation","SpaceShipOne","SpaceDev","Rocket_Lab","Reaction_Research_Society","Copenhagen_Suborbitals","Brigham_Young_University","University_of_Utah","Utah_State_University","Hydroxyl-terminated_polybutadiene","Nitrous_oxide","Stanford_University","Technical_University_of_Munich","Acids","Oxygen","Nitrous_oxide","Polyethylene","HTPB","Barbarella_(rocket)","University_of_Brasilia","Purdue_University","University_of_Michigan","University_of_Arkansas_at_Little_Rock","Hendrix_College","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","Portland_State_University","Texas_A&M_University","Boston_University","Florida_Institute_of_Technology","Bloodhound_SSC","The_Falcon_Project","Daniel_Jubb","Nitrous_oxide","Italy","University_of_Padua","American_Civil_War","Confederate_States_Army","Salami","Top_Gear_(current_format)","Reliant_Robin","Richard_Hammond","James_May","Space_shuttle","Radio-controlled_aircraft","UKRA","Spacecraft_propulsion","Rocket","SpaceDev","Scaled_Composites_SpaceShipOne","Space_Propulsion_Group"]}
