Civil servants are employees of the Crown and not the British\nParliament. Civil servants also have some traditional and statutory\nresponsibilities which to some extent protect them from being used for the\npolitical advantage of the party in power. Senior civil servants may be called\nto account to Parliament.\n\nIn general use, the term civil servant in the United Kingdom does not include\nall public sector employees; although there is no fixed legal definition, the\nterm is usually defined as \"a servant of the Crown working in a civil capacity\nwho is not the holder of a political (or judicial) office; the holder of certain\nother offices in respect of whose tenure of office special provision has been\nmade; [or] a servant of the Crown in a personal capacity paid from the Civil\nList\". Bradley and Ewing, p.272 As such, the civil service\ndoes not include government ministers (who are politically appointed), members\nof the British Armed Forces, the police, officers of local government\nauthorities or quangos or the Houses of Parliament, employees of the National\nHealth Service (NHS), or staff of the Royal Household. As of 2007, there are\napproximately 532,000 (499,000 full-time equivalent) civil servants in the Home\nCivil Service.\n\nThere are two other administratively separate civil services in the United\nKingdom. One is for Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Civil Service); the\nother is the foreign service (Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service). The heads of\nthese services are members of the Permanent Secretaries Management Group.\n","linknr":686,"url":"Her_Majesty's_Civil_Service","recorded":1362670708,"links":39,"instances":["bureaucrat","rank","united_kingdom","united_kingdom","government","business","westminster_system","civil_servant","government","trade_union","chief_of_staff_to_tony_blair","civil_servant","united_kingdom","rank","administrative_office"],"pdf":["http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/pdf/ukpga_19980038_en.pdf","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/pdf/ukpga_19980038_en.pdf","http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/web-resources/resources/0d89ba78b7c.pdf","http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/web-resources/resources/0d89ba78b7c.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/cs0708.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/cs0708.pdf","http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/4/437.full.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02671.pdf","http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-02671.pdf","http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/chinawh/web/s10/ideas.pdf","http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmpubadm/303/303.pdf","http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/osp24.pdf"],"categories":["Public
