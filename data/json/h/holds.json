Enters the game in a save situation; that is, when all of the following\n:   three conditions apply:\n:: (a) He appears in relief (i.e., is not the starting pitcher); and\n:: (b) He is not the winning pitcher; and\n:: (c) He qualifies under one of the following conditions:\n:::   (i) He enters the game with a lead of no more than three runs and\n:::       maintains that lead for at least one inning\n:::  (ii) He enters the game, regardless of the count, with the potential tying\n:::       run either on base, or at bat, or on deck\n::: (iii) He pitches effectively for at least three innings.\n\n:2. Records at least one out\n\n:3. Leaves the game before it has ended without his team having relinquished the\n:   lead at any point and does not record a save.\n\nNote that since the hold is not an official Major League Baseball statistic, the\ndefinition above can vary. One noticeable difference is that while STATS, Inc.\nrequires the pitcher to record at least one out for a hold, SportsTicker does\nnot have this requirement. This can result in discrepancies in hold totals\nbetween different\nsources.<ref>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2000/0523/546788.html Baseball\nFAQ] by Rob Neyer (formerly of ESPN); [http://web.archive.org/web/2012030419042-\n7/http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2000/0523/546788.html Internet Archive]</ref>\n","title":"Hold%20%28baseball%29","headings":["Description","Career leaders","Single season record","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["1: Relief_pitcher","1: Major_League_Baseball","1: STATS,_Inc.","1: Middle_relief_pitcher","1: Setup_pitcher","1: Espn.com","1: MLB.com","1: Fantasy_baseball","1: National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum","1: Luke_Gregerson","1: San_Diego_Padres","1: Baseball_statistics"]}
