In the course of litigation,\nhearings are conducted as oral arguments in support of motions, whether to\nresolve the case without further trial on a motion to dismiss or for summary\njudgment, or to decide discrete issues of law, such as the admissibility of\nevidence, that will determine how the trial proceeds.

The decision also illustrated that what constitutes a\n\"hearing\" can depend on the context.
