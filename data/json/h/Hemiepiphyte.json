They send roots downward, and these roots eventually make contact\nwith the ground. Secondary epiphytes begin as rooted vines growing upward from\nthe forest floor, but later break their connection to the ground.\n\nStrangler figs are hemiepiphytic â they begin life as epiphytes but after making\ncontact with the ground they encircle their host tree and \"strangle\" it. This\nusually results in the death of the host tree, either through girdling or\nthrough competition for light.\n\n growing as a hemiepiphyte on a Soft Tree Fern at Monga National Park,\n Australia]]\n","linknr":113,"url":"Hemiepiphyte","recorded":1362372986,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecology terminology","Epiphytes","Plant morphology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Strangler_fig_kerala.jpg/220px-Strangler_fig_kerala.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Elaeocarpus_holopetalus_hemiepiphyte_Devils_Creek_Tantawangalo.jpg/220px-Elaeocarpus_holopetalus_hemiepiphyte_Devils_Creek_Tantawangalo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Eucryphia_moorei_%26_Dicksonia_Monga.jpg/300px-Eucryphia_moorei_%26_Dicksonia_Monga.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Fern.jpg/35px-Fern.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Dicksonia_antarctica","South_East_Forest_National_Park","Australia","Epiphyte","Strangler_fig","Girdling","Dicksonia_antarctica","Monga_National_Park","Australia"]}
