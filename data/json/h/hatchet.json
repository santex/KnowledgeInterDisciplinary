Hatchets may also be used for hewing when making flattened\nsurfaces on logs; when the hatchet head is optimized for this purpose it is\ncalled a broadaxe.\n\nA hatchet is simply a small axe. Under this definition, modern hand axes and\ntomahawks (tamahaac) are both forms of hatchets.\n\nHatchets have a variety of uses, such as tasks normally done by a pocket knife\nwhen one is not present. The hatchet can also be used to create a fire through\nsparks and friction. Hatchet throwing is increasing in popularity.\n\nBurying the hatchet has become a phrase meaning to make peace, due to the\nNative American tradition of hiding or putting away a tomahawk when a peace\nagreement was made.\n",
