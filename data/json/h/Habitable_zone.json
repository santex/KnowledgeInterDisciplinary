For the planet initially nicknamed \"Goldilocks\", see [[70 Virginis b]].\n:For other uses, see [[Comfort zone (disambiguation)]], [[Goldilocks\n:(disambiguation)]], and the [[Goldilocks Principle]].\n for predicting the location of the habitable zone around types of stars]] In\n astronomy and astrobiology, 'habitable zone' (more accurately, 'circumstellar\n habitable zone' or 'CHZ') is the scientific term for the region around a star\n within which it is theoretically possible for a planet with sufficient\n atmospheric pressure to maintain liquid water on its surface.\n\nThe significance of the concept is in its inference of conditions favorable for\nlife on Earth â since liquid water is essential for all known forms of life,\nplanets in this zone are considered the most promising sites to host\nextraterrestrial life. The terms \"ecosphere\" and \"Liquid Water Belt\" were\nintroduced by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley respectively in 1953. Richard J. Hugget, Geoecology: an evolutionary\napproach. pg 10 Contemporary alternatives include \"HZ\", \"life zone\", and\n\"Goldilocks\nZone\". [http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/02oct_goldilocks.htm The\nGoldilocks Zone] – NASA\n\n\"Habitable zone\" is sometimes used more generally to denote various regions that\nare considered favorable to life in some way. One prominent example is the\n'Galactic Habitable Zone', coined by Guillermo Gonzalez in 1995 (representing\nthe distance of a planet from the galactic centre), based on the position of the\nEarth in the Milky Way. If different kinds of habitable zones are considered,\ntheir intersection is the region considered most likely to contain life.\n\nThe location of planets and natural satellites (moons) within its parent star's\nhabitable zone (and a near circular orbit) is but one of many criteria for\nplanetary habitability and it is theoretically possible for habitable planets\nto exist outside the habitable zone. The term \"'Goldilocks planet'\" is used for\nany planet that is located within the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) although when used in the context\nof planetary habitability the term implies terrestrial planets with conditions\nroughly comparable to those of Earth (i.e. an Earth analog). The name\noriginates from the story of [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]], in which a\nlittle girl chooses from sets of three items, ignoring the ones that are too\nextreme (large or small, hot or cold, etc.), and settling on the one in the\nmiddle, which is \"just right\". Likewise, a planet following this Goldilocks\nPrinciple is one neither too close nor too far from a star to rule out liquid\nwater on its surface.\n\nDozens of planets have been confirmed in the habitable zone, though most found\nto date are significantly larger than the Earth, possibly due to sampling bias\ndue to larger planets currently being more easily observed. The Kepler\nspacecraft has identified a further 54 candidates and current estimates indicate\n\"at least 500 million\" such planets in the Milky Way.\n\nHabitable zones, however, are not stable. Over the life of a star, the nature of\nthe zone moves and changes.

Gabor Vatican Observatory, Vatican City\n2010 Astronomical objects located in the zone are typically close in\nproximity to their parent star and as such are more exposed to adverse effects\nsuch as damaging tidal forces and solar flares. Combined with galactic\nhabitability, these and many other exclusionary factors reinforce a contrasting\ntheory of interstellar \"dead zones\" where life cannot exist, supporting the Rare\nEarth hypothesis.\n\nSome planetary scientists have suggested habitable zone theory may prove\nlimiting in scope and overly simplistic. There is growing support for equivalent\nzones around stars where other solvent compounds (such as ammonia and methane)\ncould exist in stable liquid forms. Astrobiologists theorise these environments\ncould be conducive to alternative biochemistry.

It may follow for oceans\nconsisting of ammonia or methane.
