March 1930, Hamburg - 24. November 1990, Hamburg) was a\npopular German actress, comedienne, singer, author, and theater director.\n\nFeddersen was born in Hamburg. She took up acting early in her life, first being\ncast for minor parts such as maids, cooks and cleaning ladies. After her first\nsuccesses she moved up major rÃ´les such as naive heroines, young mothers and\nyoung ladies of noble heritage.\n\nAfter a cancer operation in 1955, which resulted in a slight disfiguration of\nher face, directors shied back from casting her as romantic heroine. Shrewdly\nrecognizing the hint given to her by the fates, she decided to change genres,\nnow appearing most successfully in comedies. Being of Northern German origin\nwith a strong but likeable Northern German accent, Feddersen was mostly cast for\nproductions set in Northern Germany. She often played women of slightly naive\nbut gentle and likeable characters.\n\nDespite her success in comedies, Feddersen still remained popular as a serious\nactress. Among her most notable appearances on the silver screen was the part of\nKlothilde in the 1959 cinema adaptation of Thomas Mann's classic novel\nBuddenbrooks.\n\nIn 1963, Feddersen played a small part as a witness in Das Haus an der StÃ¶r (The\nhouse near river StÃ¶r) an episode of Stahlnetz, the German adaptation of the US-\nformat [[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]. This particular episode became the most\nsuccessful of the whole series and remains to this day as the episode which saw\nthe most re-runs.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Feddersen discovered her writing talent, and over the next\nfifteen years she wrote the scripts for several successful made-for-TV movies\nand mini series, most of them portraying the hard but hopeful lives of sailors,\nshipyard workers, fisher men and their families in the port of Hamburg and along\nthe river Elbe as well as the German North Sea Coast.\n\nIn 1971, Feddersen - who was also a highly acclaimed stage actress - was invited\nto Hamburg's famous Ohnsorg Theater. The Ohnsorg Theater remains to this day as\nthe most popular theater in Germany, and each of its productions (usually 4 to 6\nper year) is videotaped for a subsequent TV airing after the end of a play's\nscheduled run. Feddersen's 1971 guest appearance at the Ohnsorg Theater as the\nnosy, fussy middle-aged spinster Bertha Bliesemann in the play Der mÃ¶blierte\nHerr (loosely translated The Gentleman lodger) resulted in one of the most\npopular broadcasts ever from the Ohnsorg Theater. Der mÃ¶blierte Herr is\nregularly re-run on German TV.\n\nIn 1975, Feddersen was cast for the part of Else Tetzlaff in the series [[Ein\nHerz und eine Seele]], the German adaptation of the British sitcom [[Till Death\nUs Do Part]], which was known in the U. S. as [[All in the Family]]. She took\nover the part from Elisabeth Wiedemann, who had declined to sign a contract for\na new season. The part of Else's son-in-law, Michael, was also recast. The cast\nchanges, though, were immensely unpopular with the German audience, so the\nseries was discontinued. The failing of Ein Herz und eine Seele was Feddersen's\nfirst serious flop in her career.\n\nAside from being an actress, Feddersen loved to appear as a comedienne. During\nthe late 1970s, she hosted several comedy shows and enjoyed a smash hit in 1978,\nwhen she teamed up with Dieter \"Didi\" Hallervorden for the duet Die Wanne ist\nvoll (The bathtub's full), a chart topping spoof cover version of You're the one\nthat I want from the movie [[Grease (film)|Grease]]. In 1981, Feddersen enjoyed\na solo # 1 on the German charts with Gib mir bitte einen Kuss (Please, give me\njust one kiss), a spoof vocal version of the Chicken Dance.\n\nIn the 1980s, Feddersen mostly worked as a writer. Her book Hallo, hier ist\nHelga (Hello, here's Helga) became an instant best seller.\n\nIn 1983 a dream came true for her when she opened her very own theater in\nHamburg. Her self-written play Die Perle Anna (Anna, the pearl) about a witty\nand good hearted house maid was a box office hit and ran for several years.\n\nIn 1989, Feddersen was diagnosed with cancer for the second time in her life.\nAlthough she had to give up her beloved theater, her will to live helped her to\novercome cancer. In 1990, she worked as an actress again. Her guest appearance\nas a courageous policeman's widow in the long-running series GroÃstadtrevier\n(famous for its authentical portrayal of policemen's work and private lives),\nthough, became the last rÃ´le she ever played. Shortly after the filming of the\nshow's episode was completed, Feddersen was diagnosed with cancer again. Shortly\nbefore her death on November 24, 1990, she married Olli Maier, who had been her\nlife partner for more than ten years.\n\nHelga Feddersen was buried in Stuttgart by request of Olli Maier, because it was\nhis birth city. Maier was severely rebuked for this decision by the mayor and\nthe people of Hamburg, because Helga Feddersen had always declared that Hamburg\nwas her true home.\n\nHelga Feddersen is still remembered and recognized in Germany as a talented\nactress and a loveable, warm-hearted person.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Helga_Feddersen","recorded":1375070893,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Helga_Feddersen","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:Helga_Feddersen#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Hamburg","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Hamburg","/wiki/Hamburg","/wiki/Hamburg","/wiki/Thomas_Mann","/wiki/Buddenbrooks","/wiki/Dragnet_(series)","/wiki/Ein_Herz_und_eine_Seele","/wiki/Till_Death_Us_Do_Part","/wiki/All_in_the_Family","/wiki/Dieter_Hallervorden","/wiki/Grease_(film)","/wiki/Chicken_Dance","/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=edit&section=1","http://books.google.de/books?id=bgix7BXklY8C&pg=PA123","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-3-7672-1366-1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Hamburg","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Wyk_auf_F%C3%B6hr","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&oldid=544785815","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1930_births","/wiki/Category:1990_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Hamburg","/wiki/Category:German_comedians","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Helga+Feddersen&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Helga+Feddersen","/wiki/Helga_Feddersen","/wiki/Talk:Helga_Feddersen","#","/wiki/Helga_Feddersen","/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Helga_Feddersen","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Helga_Feddersen","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&oldid=544785815","/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105681","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Helga_Feddersen&id=544785815","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Helga+Feddersen","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Helga+Feddersen&oldid=544785815&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Helga_Feddersen&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helga_Feddersen","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105681#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License
