{"cursor":"2536","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Sir Henry Green' (died 6 August 1369) was an English lawyer, and Chief Justice\nof the King's Bench from 24 May 1361 to 29 October 1365. He probably came from\nNorthamptonshire. Early in his career he served both Queen Isabella and Edward\nthe Black Prince. He was made justice of the Court of Common Pleas in 1354, and\nknighted by King Edward III. In 1357 he was excommunicated for non-appearance at\nthe trial of Thomas de Lisle, bishop of Ely, in Avignon.\n\nIn 1365, while Chief Justice, he was arrested along with Sir William de\nSkipwith, the chief baron of the exchequer, and stripped of his office. The\ncharges were probably corruption; both Green and Skipwith were fined for their\noffences. Although he was never again employed by the courts, he kept his\nconsiderable estates. He died in 1369, and was buried in the church in Boughton\nin Northamptonshire. At his death his possessions descended on his two sons\nHenry and Thomas. Henry Green the younger was executed in 1399 at Bristol Castle\nby the Duke of Hereford (the future Henry IV) for his role as a councillor of\nRichard II.\n\nDuring his life he is credited to have bought the village of Greens Norton, a\nvillage in Northamptonshire for a price of 20 shillings.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Henry_Green_(justice)","recorded":1375081209,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Henry_Green_(disambiguation)","/wiki/England","/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_King%27s_Bench","/wiki/Northamptonshire","/wiki/Isabella_of_France","/wiki/Edward_the_Black_Prince","/wiki/Edward_III_of_England","/wiki/Thomas_de_Lisle","/wiki/Bishop_of_Ely","/wiki/Avignon","#cite_note-DNB-1","/wiki/William_de_Skipwith","/wiki/Exchequer_of_pleas","/wiki/Boughton,_Northamptonshire","/wiki/Henry_Green_(politician)","/wiki/Richard_II_of_England","#cite_note-DNB-1","/wiki/Greens_Norton","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-DNB_1-0","#cite_ref-DNB_1-1","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fref%3Aodnb%2F11383","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","/wiki/William_de_Shareshull","/wiki/Lord_Chief_Justice","/wiki/John_Knyvet","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&oldid=556948800","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1369_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_judges","/wiki/Category:People_excommunicated_by_the_Roman_Catholic_Church","/wiki/Category:Lords_Chief_Justice_of_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Category:Justices_of_the_Common_Pleas","/wiki/Category:Pages_using_citations_with_accessdate_and_no_URL","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:Use_British_English_from_May_2013","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Henry+Green+%28justice%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Henry+Green+%28justice%29","/wiki/Henry_Green_(justice)","/wiki/Talk:Henry_Green_(justice)","#","/wiki/Henry_Green_(justice)","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Henry_Green_(justice)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Henry_Green_(justice)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&oldid=556948800","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5722186","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Henry_Green_%28justice%29&id=556948800","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Henry+Green+%28justice%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Henry+Green+%28justice%29&oldid=556948800&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Green_(justice)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5722186#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Green_(justice)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["politician"],"pdf":[],"
