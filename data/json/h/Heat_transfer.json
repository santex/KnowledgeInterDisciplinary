{"cursor":"41978","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Heat transfer' is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the\ngeneration, use, conversion, and exchange of thermal energy and heat between\nphysical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as\nthermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of\nenergy by phase changes. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of\ndiffering chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While\nthese mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously\nin the same system.\n\nHeat conduction, also called diffusion, is the direct microscopic exchange of\nkinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems. When an\nobject is at a different temperature from another body or its surroundings, heat\nflows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature, at which\npoint they are in thermal equilibrium. Such spontaneous heat transfer always\noccurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature,\nas described by the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nHeat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid (gas or liquid) carries heat\nalong with the flow of matter in the fluid. The flow of fluid may be forced by\nexternal processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces\ncaused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus\ninfluencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called \"natural\nconvection\". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as\nwell. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is\nforced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.\n\nThe final major form of heat transfer is by radiation, which may occur through a\nvacuum or some transparent medium (solid or fluid). It is the transfer of energy\nby means of photons in electromagnetic waves in much the same way as\nelectromagnetic light waves transfer light (albeit at different wavelengths).\nThe same laws that govern the transfer of light (e.g. its speed) govern the\nradiant transfer of heat.\n","linknr":533,"url":"Heat_transfer","recorded":1362673465,"links":63,"instances":["insulation","optics","stes","unit","physics","engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.energysavers.gov/pdfs/energy_savers.pdf","http://www.energysavers.gov/pdfs/energy_savers.pdf"],"categories":["Mechanical
