{"cursor":"2212","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Hofmann elimination', also known as Exhaustive methylation, is a process where\nan amine is reacted to create a tertiary amine and an alkene by treatment with\nexcess methyl iodide followed by treatment with silver oxide, water, and\nheat.\n\n:\n\nAfter the first step, a quaternary ammonium iodide salt is created. After\nreplacement of iodine by an hydroxyl anion, an elimination reaction takes place\nto the alkene.\n\nWith asymmetrical amines, the major alkene product is the least substituted and\ngenerally the least stable, an observation known as the 'Hofmann rule'. This is\nin direct contrast to normal elimination reactions where the more substituted,\nstable product is dominant (Zaitsev's rule).\n\nThe reaction is named after its discoverer, August Wilhelm von\nHofmann.
