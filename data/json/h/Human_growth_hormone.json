It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to\ncertain kinds of cells. Growth hormone is a 191-amino acid, single-chain\npolypeptide that is synthesized, stored, and secreted by somatotropic cells\nwithin the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.\n\nGrowth hormone is used as a prescription drug in medicine to treat children's\ngrowth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency. In the United States, it\nis only available legally from pharmacies, by prescription from a doctor. In\nrecent years in the United States, some doctors have started to prescribe growth\nhormone in GH-deficient older patients (but not on healthy people) to increase\nvitality. While legal, the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been\ntested in a clinical trial. At this time, HGH is still considered a very complex\nhormone, and many of its functions are still unknown.\n\nIn its role as an anabolic agent, HGH has been abused by competitors in sports\nsince the 1960s, and it has been banned by the IOC and NCAA. Traditional urine\nanalysis could not detect doping with HGH, so the ban was unenforceable until\nthe early 2000s when blood tests that could distinguish between natural and\nartificial HGH were starting to be developed. Blood tests conducted by WADA at\nthe 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece targeted primarily HGH.\nThis use for the drug is not approved by the FDA.\n\nGH has been studied for use in raising livestock more efficiently in industrial\nagriculture and several efforts have been made to obtain governmental approval\nto use GH in livestock production. These uses have been controversial. In the\nUnited States, the only FDA-approved use of GH for livestock is the use of a cow-\nspecific form of GH called bovine somatotropin for increasing milk production in\ndairy cows. Retailers are permitted to label containers of milk as produced with\nor without bovine somatotropin.\n","linknr":779,"url":"Human_growth_hormone","recorded":1362503696,"links":56,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/UCM071853.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/UCM071853.pdf","http://www.lemars.k12.ia.us/ag/AgriScience%202%20class/Animal%20Nutrition%20Unit/Growth%20promoters%20in%20AS.pdf","http://www.lemars.k12.ia.us/ag/AgriScience%202%20class/Animal%20Nutrition%20Unit/Growth%20promoters%20in%20AS.pdf"],"categories":["Pfizer","Anterior pituitary hormones","Recombinant proteins","Peptide hormones","Growth hormones|","Anti-aging substances"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Biology","Clinical signficance","As a medication","Performance enhancement","Dietary supplements","Agricultural use","Drug development history","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Somatotropine.GIF/240px-Somatotropine.GIF","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Endocrine_growth_regulation.svg/240px-Endocrine_growth_regulation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["human_development","biology"],["cell","biology"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","human_development","cell"],"related":["Growth_hormone_1","Growth_hormone_1","Growth_hormone_2","Growth_hormone_2","Peptide_hormone","Human_development_(biology)","Cell_(biology)","Mitogen","Polypeptide","Somatotropic_cell","Anterior_pituitary","Prescription_drug","Anabolic","IOC","NCAA","Urine","Use_of_performance-enhancing_drugs_in_sport","Blood_test","World_Anti-Doping_Agency","2004_Olympic_Games","Athens,_Greece","Industrial_agriculture","Bovine_somatotropin","Growth_hormone_1","Recombinant_DNA_technology","Growth_hormone_1","Growth_hormone_2","Somatomammotropin","Placental_lactogen","Prolactin","Somatotropin_family","Amino_acid","Atomic_mass_unit","Species","Old_World_monkey","Growth_hormone_receptor","Molecule","Growth_hormone-binding_protein","Growth_hormone_receptor","Neurosecretion","Hypothalamus","Growth_hormone-releasing_hormone","Somatostatin","Hypophyseal_portal_system","Somatotropic_cell","Anterior_pituitary","Growth_hormone-releasing_hormone","Growth_hormone_releasing_hormone_receptor","Ghrelin","Growth_hormone_secretagogue_receptor","Androgen","Estrogen","Clonidine","L-DOPA","Hypoglycemia","Arginine","Propranolol","Somatostatin","Deep_sleep","Niacin","Fasting","Exercise","Somatostatin","Periventricular_nucleus","IGF-1","Negative_feedback","Hypothalamus","Hyperglycemia","Glucocorticoid","Dihydrotestosterone","Xenobiotic","Endocrine_disruptor","Anabolism","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Polypeptide","Soluble","Cell_membranes","MAPK/ERK_pathway","Chondrocyte","Cartilage","JAK-STAT_signaling_pathway","Insulin-like_growth_factor_1","Proinsulin","Liver","Endocrine_gland","Autocrine","Paracrine","Calcium","Mineralization_of_bone","Muscle","Sarcomere","Hyperplasia","Lipolysis","Protein_synthesis","Brain","Homeostasis","Liver","Glucose","Gluconeogenesis","Pancreatic_islets","Immune_system","Adenoma","Acromegaly","Carpal_tunnel_syndrome","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Gigantism","Pegvisomant","Octreotide","Bromocriptine","Growth_hormone_deficiency","Growth_failure","Short_stature","Turner_syndrome","Chronic_renal_failure","Praderâ€“Willi_syndrome","Intrauterine_growth_retardation","Idiopathic_short_stature","Wasting","AIDS","Off-label_use","Clinical_trial","American_Academy_of_Anti-Aging_Medicine","Meta-analysis","Multiple_sclerosis","Weight_loss","Obesity","Fibromyalgia","Heart_failure","Crohn's_disease","Ulcerative_colitis","Short_bowel_syndrome","Total_parenteral_nutrition","Carpal_tunnel_syndrome","Diabetes","Hodgkin's_lymphoma","Dietary_supplement","Bovine_somatotropin","Cattle_feeding","Dairy_farming","Beef_hormone_controversy","Poultry_farming","Choh_Hao_Li","Genentech","Recombinant_DNA","Pituitary_gland","Cadaver","Rhesus_macaque","Creutzfeldt-Jacob_disease","Genentech","Eli_Lilly_and_Company","Pfizer","Novo_Nordisk","Merck_Serono","RHGH","Omnitrope"]}
