{"cursor":"9023","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The term 'body weight' is used colloquially and in the biological and medical\nsciences to refer to a person's mass or weight. Body weight is measured in\nkilograms, a measure of mass, throughout the world, although in some countries\nsuch as the United States and Canada it is measured in pounds, or as in the\nUnited Kingdom, stones and pounds. Most hospitals, even in the United States,\nnow use kilograms for calculations, but use kilograms and pounds together for\nother purposes. Strictly speaking, the body weight is the weight of the person\nwithout any items on, but practically body weight is taken with clothes on but\noften without the shoes and heavy accessories like mobile phones and wallets.\n\nWhile the terms mass and weight are often used interchangeably in the context of\nbody weight, they actually refer to separate but related concepts in physics.\nMass is a measure of an object's inertia and is independent of the effects of\ngravity, while weight is a measure of the force due to gravity. Thus, if a\nperson were to travel from Earth to the Moon, where there is less gravity, their\nmass would remain unchanged but their weight would decrease.\n","linknr":232,"url":"Human_weight","recorded":1362482002,"links":30,"instances":["sport","mass","imperial_mass"],"pdf":["http://www.redsalud.gov.cl/portal/url/item/99c12b89738d80d5e04001011e0113f8.pdf","http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100915healthsurvey09en.pdf","http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100915healthsurvey09en.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr010.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr010.pdf","http://www.ecssa.org.za/images/sanguine/2011/2011-2-4.pdf"],"categories":["Human weight|"],"headings":["Ideal body weight","Average weight around the world","Stability","Estimation in children","Sports usage","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Broselowtape.JPG/220px-Broselowtape.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/d/e/dde4bdf517dcae6030c383525e9827d2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/9/5/d957747b998be5475d8210fa8ffe8e33.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/1/c21e3b8095b56cd15592d7915aa695f9.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pound","mass"],["stone","imperial_mass"],["rowing","sport"]],"members":["rowing","pound","stone"],"related":["Mass","Weight","Kilogram","Pound_(mass)","Stone_(imperial_mass)","Inertia","Force","Body_mass_index","Africa","Asia","Europe","Latin_America","Caribbean","Northern_America","Oceania","World","Brazil","Chile","Germany","South_Korea","United_Kingdom","Wales","United_States","APLS","Broselow_Pediatric_Emergency_Tape","Boxing","Mixed_martial_arts","Wrestling","Rowing_(sport)","Judo","Weight-lifting","Wrestling_weight_classes","Boxing_weight_classes","Judo_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics","Boxing_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics","Anthropometry","Bergmann's_Rule","Birth_weight","Body_mass_index","Body_volume_index","Hesse's_Rule","Human_height","List_of_the_heaviest_people","Obesity","Overweight","Underweight","Weight_loss","Weight_gain","Weight_phobia"]}
