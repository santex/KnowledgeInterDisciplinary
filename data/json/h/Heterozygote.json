{"cursor":"9745","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Zygosity' is the degree of similarity of the alleles for a trait in an\norganism.\n\nMost eukaryotes have two matching sets of chromosomes; that is, they are\ndiploid. Diploid organisms have the same genes on each of their two sets of\nhomologous chromosomes, except that the sequences of these genes may differ\nbetween the two chromosomes in a matching pair and that a few chromosomes may be\nmismatched as part of a sex-determination system. If both alleles of a diploid\norganism are the same, the organism is homozygous for the trait. If they are\ndifferent, the organism is heterozygous for that trait. If one allele is\nmissing, it is hemizygous, and, if both alleles are missing, it is nullizygous.\n\nThe DNA sequence of a gene often varies from one individual to another. Those\nvariations are called alleles. While some genes have only one allele because\nthere is low variation, others have only one allele because only that allele can\nfunction properly. Any variation from the DNA sequence of that allele will be\nfatal in the embryo, and the organism will never survive to be born. But most\ngenes have two or more alleles. The frequency of different alleles varies\nthroughout the population. Some genes may have two alleles with equal\ndistribution. For other genes, one allele may be common, and another allele may\nbe rare. Sometimes, one allele is a disease - causing variation while the other\nallele is healthy. Sometimes, the different variations in the alleles make no\ndifference at all in the function of the organism.\n\nIn diploid organisms, one allele is inherited from the male parent and one from\nthe female parent. Zygosity is a description of whether those two alleles have\nidentical or different DNA sequences. In some cases the term \"zygosity\" is used\nin the context of a single chromosome.\n","linknr":193,"url":"Heterozygote","recorded":1362374024,"links":36,"instances":["genetics","bee","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics"],"headings":["Types","Autozygous and allozygous","Monozygotic and dizygotic twins","Heterozygosity in population genetics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/3/c/f3c37fb2503434e91c3ff36ab574232a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/b/a/8ba64e39bc05b083fcceb19b737f5feb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/f/e/efe4a8231b097d8f39a561287522d2e3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/6/0e65782a07921309bab9bcf5e5c1e0ed.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/6/8/b68620b522a8f32fccd84050c078fcfb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/8/6f8f57715090da2632453988d9a1501b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/b/b/dbb3b84cea7e7015fb1a591964fbd918.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/1/4/21479f1e549e1fcbde3442f4a1a4db21.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","genetics"],["dominance","genetics"],["drone","bee"]],"members":["dominance","drone","locus"],"related":["Allele","Eukaryote","Chromosomes","Diploid","Alleles","Genetic_disorder","Genotype","Locus_(genetics)","Homologous_chromosomes","True_breeding_organism","Dominance_(genetics)","Recessive_trait","Transgenic_maize","Allele","Sex_linkage","X_chromosome","Y_chromosome","Drone_(bee)","Inbreeding","Sperm","Population_genetics","Allele_frequency","Heterosis","Heterozygote_advantage","Loss_of_heterozygosity","Nucleotide_diversity"]}
