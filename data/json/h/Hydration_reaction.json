{"cursor":"2137","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn organic chemistry, a 'hydration reaction' is a chemical reaction in which a\nhydroxyl group (OH − ) and a hydrogen cation (an acidic proton)\nare added to the two carbon atoms bonded together in the carbon-carbon double\nbond which makes up an alkene functional group. The reaction usually runs in a\nstrong acidic, aqueous solution. Hydration differs from hydrolysis in that\nhydrolysis cleaves the non-water component in two. Hydration leaves the non-\nwater component intact.\n\nThe general chemical equation of the reaction is the following:\n\n:RRC=CH 2 in H 2O/acid → RRC(-OH)-CH 3\n\nIn the first step, the acidic proton bonds to the less substituted carbon of the\ndouble bond following Markovnikov's rule. In the second step an H 2O\nmolecule bonds to the other, more highly substituted carbon. The oxygen atom at\nthis point has three bonds and carries a positive charge. Another water molecule\ncomes along and takes up the extra proton.\n\nWhen carried out in the laboratory, this reaction tends to yield many\nundesirable side products, (for example Diethyl Ether in the process of creating\nEthanol) and in its simple form described here is not considered very useful for\nthe production of alcohol.\n\nConceptually similar reactions include:\n* hydroamination\n* hydroalkoxylation\n* hydrosilylation\n* hydrohalogenation\n","linknr":118,"url":"Hydration_reaction","recorded":1362675315,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Addition reactions"],"headings":["Mechanism","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Hydrationreaction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_chemistry","Chemical_reaction","Hydroxyl","Hydrogen","Cation","Acid","Proton","Carbon","Covalent_bond","Carbon-carbon_double_bond","Alkene","Functional_group","Aqueous","Solution","Hydrolysis","Chemical_equation","Markovnikov's_rule","Molecule","Ethanol","Hydroamination","Hydroalkoxylation","Hydrosilylation","Hydrohalogenation","Dehydration_reaction"]}
