It carries the connotation of behaviors or beliefs likely to\nundermine accepted morality and cause tangible evils, damnation, or other\npunishment.\n\nIn Abrahamic religions, it also implies that the heretic is in alliance with the\nreligion's symbol of evil, such as Satan or chaos.<ref></ref> In certain\nhistorical Christian, Jewish, and some modern cultures, espousing ideas deemed\nheretical was punishable by law.\n",
