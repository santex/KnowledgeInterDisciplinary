{"cursor":"7576","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Hereditary titles', in a general sense, are titles of nobility, positions\nor styles that are hereditary and thus tend or are bound to remain in\nparticular families.\n\nAlthough both monarchs and nobles usually inherit their titles, often the\nmechanisms differ, even in the same country: The United Kingdom's crown has\nhistorically been heritable by women in the absence of brothers since the\nmedieval era, and in the early 21st century constitutional changes to the order\nof succession to the Commonwealth realms were expected. By contrast, the vast\nmajority of noble titles granted by British sovereigns are not hereditary at\nall, and most of those which are cannot be inherited by a woman.\n\nOften a hereditary title is inherited only by the legitimate, eldest son of the\noriginal grantee and/or that son's male heir according to masculine\nprimogeniture. In some countries, titles descended to all children of\nthe grantee equally, as well as to all of that grantee's remoter descendants,\nmale and female, in the legitimate male line. Historically, females have much\nless frequently been granted noble titles and, still more rarely, hereditary\ntitles. However it was not uncommon for a female to inherit a noble title if she\nsurvived all kinsmen descended patrilineally from the original grantee or, in\nEngland, if she survived just her own brothers and their male-line descendants.\nRarely, a noble title descends to the eldest child regardless of gender\n(although by law this has become the prevalent form of titular inheritance among\nthe Spanish nobility). A title may occasionally be shared and thus multiplied,\nin the case of a single title, or divided when the family bears multiple titles.\nIn some traditions inheritance by adoption is an alternative to inheritance by\nbiological kinship, as in the Hindu tradition to assure there is a male heir of\nthe same caste. In the French nobility, often the children and other male-line\ndescendants of a lawful noble titleholder self-assumed the same or a lower title\nof nobility; while not legal, such titles were generally tolerated at court\nduring both the [[ancien regime]] and 19th century France as [[courtesy\ntitle|titres de courtoisie]].\n\nProminent examples of hereditary titles include: *Hereditary monarchy â in the\nCommonwealth realms, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, Thailand, Belgium,\nDenmark, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Monaco, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain,\nSweden, Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tonga and Bahrain. Other national\nconstitutions use different modes of succession to their monarchies, e.g. the\nelection of the Pope in the Vatican City, and especially in the Orient often\nadding an element of selection (e.g. at a family council) among eligible\nrelations of the monarch. Special cases are the two elective monarchies,\nMalaysia [http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk1/rk1.htm Yang di-\nPertuan Agong ] and the United Arab Emirates,\nwhere the constituent states of each federation are hereditary monarchies but\nthose rulers form an electoral college which assigns the federal position of\nhead of state to one of their number for a term (of five years). *Titles of\nnobility in the United Kingdom and other countries (see peerage). In the United\nKingdom, most titles of nobility (peerages and the lower title of Baronet) pass\nonly to the eldest son (or occasionally the eldest daughter in the absence of\nmale heirs); all other sons and daughters of peers are commoners though they may\nuse one or more not independently heritable courtesy titles, either Lord, Lady\nor The Honourable depending on the rank of the peerage held by their father or\nmother, or another title styled like a peerage but without a seat in the Lords,\nusually one or two ranks below father's. In many European\ncountries titles may be inherited by all the heirs male of a family, whose\nmembers thus all share the same title at the same time (for instance, within the\nszlachta nobility of Poland or in the nobilities of the successor states of the\nHoly Roman Empire). In the Far East the main (Chinese-induced) tradition is\nrather for titles to devalue as the generations succeed each other, but not to\nthe same rank. *Hereditary chieftaincy - manifested in countries located in\nvarious parts of Africa, Asia, South America and Oceania. Examples range from\nthe politically powerful (such as the Nigerian traditional rulers and the king\nof the Zulu Nation) to the merely titular (such as the rajas of India and the\nArab shaykhs). *Some court titles, e.g. in the United Kingdom, including Earl\nMarshal [http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/earl_marshal.htm Earl Marshal ] and Lord Great Chamberlain. Most of these are\nsinecures, i.e. purely ceremonial. They pass generally to the eldest son (except\nfor that of Lord Great Chamberlain, which is split between the heads of the\nCholmondeley and Willoughby families). *Many other â especially feudal age â\noffices became inheritable, often connected to military (e.g. keeper of a\ncastle; in Japan even Shogun) and/or domanial functions, which is also why some\nsuch functions became noble titles (e.g. Burgrave, Margrave) *While the\nhereditary membership of a privileged class or caste may imply a title or not\n(sometimes confusingly called untitled nobility), it frequently forms a\nprerequisite for various titled positions, e.g. quarters of nobility required by\na military order.\n* Certain religious positions, such as the Aga Khan and DÄ'Ä« al-Mutlaq.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Hereditary_title","recorded":1374962877,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Title","/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)","/wiki/Hereditary","/wiki/Order_of_succession","/wiki/Commonwealth_realms","/wiki/Primogeniture","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Patrilineality","/wiki/Spanish_nobility","/wiki/Caste","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/French_nobility","/wiki/Court_(royal)","/wiki/Ancien_regime","/wiki/Courtesy_title","/wiki/Monarchy","/wiki/Commonwealth_realm","/wiki/Bhutan","/wiki/Brunei","/wiki/Cambodia","/wiki/Japan","/wiki/Thailand","/wiki/Belgium","/wiki/Denmark","/wiki/Luxembourg","/wiki/Liechtenstein","/wiki/Monaco","/wiki/Netherlands","/wiki/Norway","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Sweden","/wiki/Jordan","/wiki/Morocco","/wiki/Qatar","/wiki/Saudi_Arabia","/wiki/Tonga","/wiki/Bahrain","/wiki/Malaysia","#cite_note-2","/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates","/wiki/Nobility","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Baronet","/wiki/Peers","/wiki/Courtesy_title","/wiki/Lord","/wiki/Lady","/wiki/Honourable","#cite_note-BP-3","/wiki/Szlachta","/wiki/Poland","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Chieftaincy","/wiki/Africa","/wiki/Asia","/wiki/South_America","/wiki/Oceania","/wiki/Nigerian_traditional_rulers","/wiki/King_of_the_Zulu_Nation","/wiki/Raja","/wiki/India","/wiki/Arab","/wiki/Shaykh","/wiki/Court_appointment","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Earl_Marshal","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Lord_Great_Chamberlain","/wiki/Sinecure","/wiki/Cholmondeley","/wiki/Willoughby","/wiki/Keeper","/wiki/Shogun","/wiki/Quarters_of_nobility","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Aga_Khan","/wiki/D%C4%81%27%C4%AB_al-Mutlaq","/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Title","/wiki/Use_of_courtesy_titles_and_honorifics_in_professional_writing","/wiki/False_titles_of_nobility","/wiki/Honorifics","/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)","/wiki/Royal_and_noble_styles","/wiki/Forms_of_address_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Monarchy","/wiki/Nobility","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Royal_and_Noble_Ranks","/wiki/Great_Officers_of_State","/wiki/Aristocracy","/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/portal_bi/rk1/rk1.htm","#cite_ref-BP_3-0","http://web.archive.org/web/20060711185146/http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/peerage/sitepages/page66b.asp","http://www.burkes-peerage.net/sites/peerage/sitepages/page66b.asp","#cite_ref-4","http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/earl_marshal.htm","/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&action=edit&section=3","http://www.hereditarytitles.com/","http://www.aristocracyuk.co.uk/hereditary_titles_a_guide/","http://www.heraldica.org/topics/odegard/titlefaq.htm","http://www.chinet.com/~laura/html/titles01.html","http://www.faketitles.com/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&oldid=564863826","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Titles","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_February_2007","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hereditary+title&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hereditary+title","/wiki/Hereditary_title","/wiki/Talk:Hereditary_title","#","/wiki/Hereditary_title","/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hereditary_title&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Hereditary_title","/wiki/Special:R
