{"cursor":"7009","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'(Herschel) Lewis Austin' (22 March 1911 â 8 April 1974) was a\nBritish furniture-maker and Labour Party politician who served as a Member of\nParliament (MP) from 1945 to 1950. Austin was born in Plymouth, England, the son\nof Austrian immigrants, who later anglicised their surname from the Austrian\n\"Ornstein\".\n\nLew, as he was known, grew up in poverty in the East End of London. His father\nMordechai (Max), a bamboo worker, died of pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of\n44, when Lewis was aged just 3, in 1914.\n\nAfter leaving school at the age of 11, he educated himself as much as he could\nby attending night classes and visiting libraries when he wasn't working as an\napprentice cabinet maker. He owed much of his wide-ranging education to Toynbee\nHall, a benevolent institution still active in the East End. He later went into\nbusiness with his three of his brothers, producing affordable furniture with\nwhat became Austinsuite furnishings, a precursor to the flatpack furniture later\nadopted by M.F.I. in the U.K.\n\nDuring World War II, the family business, F Austin Leyton Ltd, manufactured\nmilitary aircraft including the de Havilland Mosquito. Lew Austin was production\nmanager. On one occasion Lord Beaverbrook, the Canadian newspaper entrepreneur\nwho was Minister of Aircraft Production in Churchill's war Ministry, visited the\nfactory and was shown round by \"Mr. Lew\". After the visit one of the men's\ntoilets had two articles graffiti on the wall. The first read \"Lord Beaverbrook\nis a c**t\" The second read \"No I'm not\".\n\nIn 1944, after having previously been refused permission to leave his civilian\nemployment, Lew Austin joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve where he served\nfirst on destroyers in the Mediterranean and then in the Fleet Air Arm, ending\nup in a staff position at a Naval headquarters at Lee on Solent rising to the\nrank of Sub Lieutenant (Sub.-Lt). He was also prominent in the Fabian Society\nalong with his older brother, the late Frank Austin O.B.E., and was effectively\nheadhunted for a direction shift into politics, after being told by a colleague,\n\"You are wasted here, you're needed in the Labour Party\".\n\nHe joined the party, and in Labour's landslide victory at the 1945 general\nelection he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Stretford\nconstituency in Manchester, defeating the sitting Conservative MP, Ralph\nEtherton. {{cite book |last=Craig |first=F.

When\ncampaigning for the seat he eventually won, late in 1945 when the ashes of World\nWar II were still glowing, he was asked by a heckler at a political rally \"what\nis the candidate's religion?\". He replied \"I have no religion; I am a free\nthinker. But I am a Jew and a carpenter and the son of a capenter but unlike\nanother son of a capenter two thousand years ago I don't expect to be crucified\nfor my beliefs.\"\n\nDuring his time in Parliament Lewis Austin was one of a dozen or so Jewish\nMembers during the period when the British Mandate of Palestine ended and the\nstate of Israel was born. He and his Jewish colleagues fought many battles in\nthe party room over British policy on the Palestine issue. Austin, who regarded\nthe Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin as an antimsemite, once challenged Bevin to\n'come outside' the party room. Austin had been a keen amateur boxer as a young\nman. He later told family members that Bevin had suggested \"we can leave it to\nthe Arabs to kick the bloody Jews into the sea\".\n\nAt that time Austin published a circular entitled \"the importance of being\nErnest (Bevin)\" which attacked Bevin and his policies roundly, and as result\nfaced discipline from Transport House, headquarters of the Labour Party.\n\nAustin gained something of a reputation as a leftwing firebrand while in\nParliament, and some years later was detained on Ellis Island by US immigration\nfor a number of days on suspicion of being a communist, at the height of the\nMcCarthyist movement in the USA.\n\nAfter his brief stint in politics, he moved with his wife and young family to\nJamaica for a number of years, living in Montego Bay. It was there he took time\nout to reflect on his next career move. He later returned to the U.K., bring his\nfamily to the Hove area, near Brighton in Sussex. He then worked for a four to\nsix month stint as a door-to-door salesman of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. He\nwas discouraged from carrying this on by his wife, the late Irene Austin, later\nDame Irene Murray, of the Knights of Saint John, Malta. He then set up his own\nbusiness in dealing with Stocks and Shares, acting as a licensed dealer until\nhis untimely death in April 1974, not long after the Black Monday stock market\ncrash of Spring 1974.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Herschel_Lewis_Austin","recorded":1375075270,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Plymouth,_England","/wiki/East_End_of_London","/wiki/Toynbee_Hall","/wiki/De_Havilland_Mosquito","/wiki/Max_Aitken,_1st_Baron_Beaverbrook","/wiki/Minister_of_Aircraft_Production","/wiki/Winston_Churchill","/wiki/Royal_Navy_Volunteer_Reserve","/wiki/Fleet_Air_Arm","/wiki/Fabian_Society","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Stretford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Manchester","/wiki/Ralph_Etherton","#cite_note-craig1918-1949-2","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1950","/wiki/Samuel_Storey,_Baron_Buckton","#cite_note-kimber-1950-3","/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine","/wiki/Israel","/wiki/Ernest_Bevin","/wiki/Ellis_Island","/wiki/Jamaica","/wiki/Montego_Bay","/wiki/Hove","/wiki/Brighton","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Scommons5.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","#cite_ref-craig1918-1949_2-0","/wiki/F._W._S._Craig","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-900178-06-X","#cite_ref-kimber-1950_3-0","http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge50/i19.htm","http://www.furnituremkrs.co.uk/PastMasters.aspx","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&action=edit&section=2","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/sub-lieutenant-herschel-austin","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Ralph_Etherton","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Stretford_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1950","/wiki/Samuel_Storey,_Baron_Buckton","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&oldid=486631473","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1911_births","/wiki/Category:1974_deaths","/wiki/Category:British_Jews","/wiki/Category:Labour_Party_(UK)_MPs","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1945%E2%80%931950","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Royal_Naval_Volunteer_Reserve_personnel_of_World_War_II","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP-MP_template_with_two_unnamed_parameters","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_February_2008","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Herschel+Lewis+Austin&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Herschel+Lewis+Austin","/wiki/Herschel_Lewis_Austin","/wiki/Talk:Herschel_Lewis_Austin","#","/wiki/Herschel_Lewis_Austin","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Herschel_Lewis_Austin&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:Wh
