Hemoglobin in the blood\ncarries oxygen from the respiratory organs (lungs or gills) to the rest of the\nbody (i.e. the tissues) where it releases the oxygen to burn nutrients to\nprovide energy to power the functions of the organism, and collects the\nresultant carbon dioxide to bring it back to the respiratory organs to be\ndispensed from the organism.\n\nIn mammals, the protein makes up about 97% of the red blood cells' dry content,\nand around 35% of the total content (including water). Hemoglobin has\nan oxygen binding capacity of 1.34 mL O 2 per gram of\nhemoglobin, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventy-\nfold compared to dissolved oxygen in blood. The mammalian hemoglobin molecule\ncan bind (carry) up to four oxygen molecules.\n\nHemoglobin is involved in the transport of other gases: it carries some of the\nbody's respiratory carbon dioxide (about 10% of the total) as\ncarbaminohemoglobin, in which CO 2 is bound to the globin protein. The\nmolecule also carries the important regulatory molecule nitric oxide bound to a\nglobin protein thiol group, releasing it at the same time as oxygen. Respiratory Function of Hemoglobin. Connie C.W. Hsia, M.D. N\nEngl J Med 1998; 338:239-248 January 22, 1998\n\nHemoglobin is also found outside red blood cells and their progenitor lines.\nOther cells that contain hemoglobin include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in the\nsubstantia nigra, macrophages, alveolar cells, and mesangial cells in the\nkidney. In these tissues, hemoglobin has a non-oxygen-carrying function as an\nantioxidant and a regulator of iron metabolism.\n\nHemoglobin and hemoglobin-like molecules are also found in many invertebrates,\nfungi, and plants. In these organisms, hemoglobins may carry oxygen, or they may\nact to transport and regulate other things such as carbon dioxide, nitric oxide,\nhydrogen sulfide and sulfide. A variant of the molecule, called leghemoglobin,\nis used to scavenge oxygen away from systems, such as the nitrogen-fixing\nnodules of leguminous plants, before the oxygen can poison the system.\n","linknr":1228,"url":"Haemoglobin","recorded":1362484380,"links":99,"instances":["biology","medical","unit","protein","physiology","medicine","physiology","band","biology","biochemistry","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.okcareertech.org/cimc/special/nochild/downloads/science/Protein.Crystallography.pdf","http://www.okcareertech.org/cimc/special/nochild/downloads/science/Protein.Crystallography.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/309/5744/2160d.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/309/5744/2160d.pdf"],"categories":["Hemoglobins","Respiratory
