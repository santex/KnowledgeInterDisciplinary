{"cursor":"10175","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"''.]]\n\n'Hydrography' refers to the mapping or charting of water's topographic features.\nIt involves measuring the depths, tides, and currents of a body of water and\nestablishing the topography and morphology of seas, rivers, and lake beds.\nNormally and historically the purpose of charting a body of water is for the\nsafety of shipping navigation. Such charting includes the positioning and\nidentification of things such as wrecks, reefs, structures (platforms etc.),\nnavigational lights, marks and buoys and coastline characteristics. Hydrography\ndoes not include water quality or composition which are part of the broader\nfield of hydrology.\n","linknr":429,"url":"Hydrography","recorded":1362371924,"links":64,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hydrography|","Oceanography|Hydrography","Hydrology","Physical geography"],"headings":["Overview","History","Organizations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Table_of_Geography_and_Hydrography%2C_Cyclopaedia%2C_Volume_1.jpg/200px-Table_of_Geography_and_Hydrography%2C_Cyclopaedia%2C_Volume_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Upwelling.svg/140px-Upwelling.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png/140px-Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg/110px-Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Topography","Water","River_morphology","Sea","River","Lake","Safety","Navigation","Wreck","Reef","Buoy","Coastline","Hydrology","Hydrocarbon","Tides","Ocean_currents","Wave","Seafloor","Shoal","Reef","Ship","Hydrographic_survey","Hill","Mountain","Tower","Topography","Bathymetric_chart","Mariner","Hydrographic_Office","Hydrographic_charts","Bowditch's_American_Practical_Navigator","Geomorphology","Echo_sounding","Stream","Environmental_flow","Water_quality","Drainage_basin","Rivers","Potable_water","Commerce","Military","Navies","James_McNeill_Whistler","Cartographer","Harbor","Hydrographic_office","International_Hydrographic_Organization","United_Kingdom_Hydrographic_Office","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","U.S.&nbsp;Department_of_Commerce","Bathymetric_chart","Cartography","Coastal_geography","Challenger_expedition","Evapotranspiration","Hydrographic_survey","Hydrology","Hydrometeorology","Hydrometry","Pierre_Desceliers","Trasvasement","Virtual_water"]}
