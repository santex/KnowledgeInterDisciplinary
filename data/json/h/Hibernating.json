{"cursor":"18439","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n hibernating in Norway]] 'Hibernation' is a state of inactivity and metabolic\n depression in endotherms. Hibernation refers to a season of heterothermy that\n is characterized by low body temperature, slow breathing and heart rate, and\n low metabolic rate. Although traditionally reserved for \"deep\" hibernators such\n as rodents, the term has been redefined to include animals such as bears and is\n now applied based on active metabolic suppression  rather than based on absolute body temperature decline. Many\n experts believe that the processes of daily torpor and hibernation form a\n continuum and utilize similar mechanisms.\n Hibernation during the summer months is known as aestivation. Some reptile\n species (ectotherms) are said to brumate, or undergo brumation, but any\n possible similarities between brumation and hibernation are not firmly\n established.\n\nOften associated with cold temperatures, the purpose of hibernation is to\nconserve energy during a period when sufficient food is scarce. To achieve this\nenergy savings, an endotherm will first decrease its metabolic rate, which then\nresults in a decreased body temperature.\nHibernation may last several days, weeks, or months depending on the species,\nambient temperature, time of year, and individual animal's body condition.\n\nBefore entering hibernation, animals need to store enough energy to last the\nentire winter. Larger species become hyperphagic and eat a large amount of food\nand store the energy in fat deposits. In many small species, food caching\nreplaces eating and becoming fat. Some species of mammals hibernate\nwhile gestating young, which are either born while the mother hibernates or\nshortly afterwards.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Hibernating","recorded":1362485054,"links":74,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":["http://users.iab.uaf.edu/~brian_barnes/publications/1989barnes.pdf","http://users.iab.uaf.edu/~brian_barnes/publications/1989barnes.pdf","http://web.wits.ac.za/NR/rdonlyres/3ED778A4-2CAF-450B-985D-C8B7E1EEDA92/0/FRNJtorporJAB.pdf","http://web.wits.ac.za/NR/rdonlyres/3ED778A4-2CAF-450B-985D-C8B7E1EEDA92/0/FRNJtorporJAB.pdf","http://users.iab.uaf.edu/~brian_barnes/publications/1989barnes.pdf"],"categories":["Physiology","Winter","Ethology"],"headings":["Hibernating mammals","Hibernating birds","Dormancy in fish","Hibernation induction trigger","Artificial hibernation","Hibernation Research and Human Health","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Eptesicus_nilssonii_hibernating.JPG/220px-Eptesicus_nilssonii_hibernating.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Myotis_mystacinus_hibernation4.JPG/50px-Myotis_mystacinus_hibernation4.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Bear_hibernating.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"],["sleep","non-human"]],"members":["hypoxia","sleep"],"related":["Metabolism","Endotherm","Heterothermy","Torpor","Aestivation","Ectotherm","Brumation","Gestation","Primate","Tropical","Mammal","Kathrin_Dausmann","Philipps_University_of_Marburg","Germany","Fat-tailed_Dwarf_Lemur","Madagascar","Hypometabolism","Obligate","Ground_squirrel","Rodents","Mouse_lemur","European_Hedgehog","Insectivores","Monotremes","Marsupials","Arctic_ground_squirrel","Facultative","Pliny_the_Elder","Swallow","Gilbert_White","Torpor","Common_Poorwill","Edmund_Jaeger","Hypoxia_(medical)","Basking_shark","North_Sea","Epaulette_shark","Goldfish","Red-eared_slider","Wood_frog","Bar-headed_goose","New_Scientist","Organ_transplant","Opioid","DADLE","Induced_coma","Interstellar_travel","Suspended_animation","Torpor","Sleep_(non-human)","Cryobiology"]}
