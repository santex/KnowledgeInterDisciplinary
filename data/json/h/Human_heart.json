The heart is divided into four main chambers: the\ntwo upper chambers are called the left and right atria (singular atrium) and two\nlower chambers are called the right and left ventricles. There is a thick wall of muscle separating the\nright side and the left side of the heart called the septum. Normally with each\nbeat the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs that the\nleft ventricle pumps out into the body. Physicians commonly refer to the right\natrium and right ventricle together as the 'right heart' and to the left atrium\nand left ventricle as the 'left heart'.\n\nThe electric energy that stimulates the heart occurs in the sinoatrial node,\nwhich produces a definite potential and then discharges, sending an impulse\nacross the atria.\n\nWe don't know very well how the electric signal moves in the atria. It seems\nthat in the atria the electrical signal moves in a radial way, but Bachmann's\nbundle and coronary sinus muscle play a role in conduction between the two atria\nwhich have a nearly simultaneous systole. While\nin the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the\nPurkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the\nmyocardium.\n\nThe human embryonic heart begins beating at around 21 days after conception, or\nfive weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP). The first day of the\nLMP is normally used to date the start of the gestation (pregnancy).\n\nThe human heart begins beating at a rate near the motherâs, about 75-80 beats\nper minute (BPM). The embryonic heart rate (EHR) then accelerates by\napproximately 100 BPM during the first month to peak at 165-185 BPM during the\nearly 7th week after conception, (early 9th week after the LMP). This\nacceleration is approximately 3.3 BPM per day, or about 10 BPM every three days,\nwhich is an increase of 100 BPM in the first month.\n\nDuBose, TJ (1996) Fetal Sonography, p. 263-\n274; Philadelphia: WB Saunders ISBN 0-7216-5432-0 The regression formula,\nwhich describes this acceleration before the embryo reaches 25 mm in crown-\nrump length, or 9.2 LMP weeks, is: the Age in days = EHR(0.3)+6. Terry J.\nDuBose [http://www.obgyn.net/english/pubs/features/dubose/ehr-age.htm Sex, Heart\nRate and Age]\n\nAfter 9.1 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 152 BPM (Â±25 BPM) during\nthe 15th week post LMP. After the 15th week, the deceleration slows to an\naverage rate of about 145 (Â±25 BPM) BPM, at term. There is no difference in\nfemale and male heart rates before birth. The human heart and its disorders\n(cardiopathies) are studied primarily by cardiologists.\n","linknr":444,"url":"Human_heart","recorded":1362892872,"links":40,"instances":["medicine","anatomy","heart"],"pdf":["http://thorax.bmj.com/content/6/4/359.full.pdf","http://thorax.bmj.com/content/6/4/359.full.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr55/nvsr55_19.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr55/nvsr55_19.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/hsq0506.pdf"],"categories":["Heart","Cardiac anatomy"],"headings":["Structure","Functioning","Lifestyle and heart health","Gallery","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Anatomy_Heart_English_Tiesworks.jpg/200px-Anatomy_Heart_English_Tiesworks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Surface_anatomy_of_the_heart.png/200px-Surface_anatomy_of_the_heart.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/EHR-BBII.jpg/220px-EHR-BBII.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Heart_diagram_blood_flow_en.svg/220px-Heart_diagram_blood_flow_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Real-time_MRI_-_Thorax.ogv/120px--Real-time_MRI_-_Thorax.ogv.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Real-time_MRI_-_Human_Heart_%28short-axis_view%29.ogv/120px--Real-time_MRI_-_Human_Heart_%28short-axis_view%29.ogv.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Heart%2C_aorta_and_pulmonary_artery.jpg/120px-Heart%2C_aorta_and_pulmonary_artery.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Heart_diagram-en.svg/120px-Heart_diagram-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Coronary_arteries.png/120px-Coronary_arteries.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["organ","anatomy"],["systole","medicine"],["atrium","heart"]],"members":["systole","organ","atrium"],"related":["Circulatory_system","Right_coronary_artery","Left_coronary_artery","Anterior_interventricular_artery","Superior_vena_cava","Inferior_vena_cava","Pulmonary_veins","Organ_(anatomy)","Blood","Circulatory_system","Cardiac_cycle","Organ_(anatomy)","Human_body","Heart_chamber","Septum","Lungs","Electric_energy","Sinoatrial_node","Electric_potential","Systole_(medicine)","Purkinje_fibers","Myocardium","Embryon","Menstrual_period","Embryo","Heart_rate","Heart_disease","Cardiologists","Heart","Pericardium","Parietal_pericardium","Visceral_pericardium","Serous_pericardium","Pericardial_fluid","Fibrous_pericardium","Myocardium","Endocardium","Endothelium","Tricuspid_valve","Mitral_valve","Aortic_valve","Pulmonary_valve","Septum","Right_heart","Right_atrium","Right_ventricle","Pulmonary_circulation","Gas_exchange","Diffusion","Left_heart","Lung","Left_atrium","Left_ventricle","Systemic_circulation","Atrium_(heart)","Tricuspid_valve","Artery","Vein","Mitral_valve","Aorta","Inferior_vena_cava","Superior_vena_cava","Cholesterol","Heart_disease","Real-time_MRI","Coronal_plane","Coronary_circulation","Electrocardiography","Heart_rate","Blood_pressure"]}
