It appears often in mathematical equations, recipes,\nmeasurements, etc. Half can also be said to be one part of something divided\ninto two equal parts.\n\nFor instance, the area S of a triangle is computed\n\n:S = &frac12; &times; base &times; perpendicular height.\n\nOne half also figures in the formula for calculating figurate numbers, such as\ntriangular numbers and pentagonal numbers:\n\n:&frac12; &times; n [(s - 2) n - (4 - s)]\n\nand in the formula for computing magic constants for magic squares\n\n:M<sub>2</sub>(n) = &frac12; &times; [n (n<sup>2</sup> + 1 )].\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis states that every nontrivial complex root of the Riemann\nzeta function has a real part equal to 1/2.\n\nOne half has two different decimal expansions, the familiar 0.5 and the\nrecurring 0.49999999... It has a similar pair of expansions in any even base. It\nis a common trap to believe these expressions represent distinct numbers: see\nthe proof that 0.999... equals 1 for detailed discussion of a related case.\n","title":"One%20half","headings":["Particularities in writing and language","See also","References <!--At last! -->"]},"micro-relation":["2: Decimal","2: Division_by_two","1: Numerical_prefix","1: Greek_language","1: Latin","1: Binary_numeral_system","1: Dozenal","1: Hexadecimal","1: Continued_fraction","1: Floating_point","1: Irreducible_fraction","1: Figurate_numbers","1: Triangular_number","1: Pentagonal_number","1: Magic_square","1: Riemann_hypothesis","1: Complex_number","1: Riemann_zeta_function","1: Recurring_decimal","1: Proof_that_0.999..._equals_1","1: Typewriter","1: Fractions#Writing_fractions","1: Code_page_437","1: Unicode","1: C1_Controls_and_Latin-1_Supplement","1: Number_Forms","1: Language","1: Suppletion","1: English_language","1: List_of_numbers"]}
