This is done in many countries as a\nsymbol of respect, mourning, or distress.\n\nThe tradition of flying the flag at half-mast began in the 17th\ncentury,<ref>[http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/40173 Why Are Flags\nFlown at Half-Staff in Times of Mourning?]</ref> perhaps to allow \"the invisible\nflag of death\" to fly at the top of the mast—which signified death's presence,\npower, and prominence.<ref>Franklyn, Julian, Shield and Crest: An Account of the\nArt and Science of Heraldry (London: MacGibbon & Kee, 1961), 176</ref> In some\ncountries, for example the UK, and especially in military contexts, a \"half-\nmast\" flag is still flown exactly one flag's height down from its normal\nposition, and no lower, to allow for this flag of death. This was the original\nflag etiquette. It is now standard, especially outside the UK, to fly the flag\nat halfway down the mast regardless of the size of the flag or hoist. (For\nmodern UK practice see below.)\n\nWhen hoisting a flag that is to be displayed at half-mast, it should be hoisted\nto the finial for an instant, then lowered to half-mast. Likewise when it is\nlowered at the end of the day, it is to be hoisted to the finial for an instant,\nand then lowered.\n\nIn the US, the term \"half-mast\" is commonly used colloquially to refer to half-\nstaff, although US law and military tradition indicate that \"half-mast\" is\ngenerally reserved to usage aboard a ship, where flags are typically flown from\nmasts.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/68/88/2888.html Bartleby: Half-staff]</ref><ref>[http://www.usa-flag-site.org/faq/half-\nstaff.shtml] Does a Flag Fly at Half-staff or Half-mast?</ref> Not all English-\nspeaking nations observe this distinction.<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/xf-\nhalf.html Flags at half mast]</ref>\n",
