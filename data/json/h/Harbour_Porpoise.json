It\nis one of the smallest marine mammals. As its name implies, it stays close to\ncoastal areas or river estuaries, and as such, is the most familiar porpoise to\nwhale watchers. This porpoise often ventures up rivers, and has been seen\nhundreds of miles from the sea. The harbour porpoise may be polytypic, with\ngeographically distinct populations representing distinct races: P. p. phocoena\nin the North Atlantic and West Africa, P. p. relicta in the Black Sea and Sea of\nAzov, an unnamed population in the northwest Pacific and P. p. vomerina in the\nnortheast Pacific.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Harbour_Porpoise","recorded":1372152329,"links":[],"instances":["island"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Porpoises","Mammals of Europe","Mammals of North America","Fauna of the Atlantic Ocean","Fauna of the North Sea","Fauna of the Baltic Sea","Fauna of the Black Sea","Fauna of the Pacific Ocean","Animals described in 1758","Mammals of Western Sahara"],"headings":["Etymology","Physical description","Populations and distribution","Natural history","Conservation","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["newfoundland","island"]],"members":["newfoundland"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Cetacea","Odontoceti","Phocoenidae","Carl_Linnaeus","10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Species","Porpoise","Marine_mammals","Whale-watching","Polytypic","Latin","Danish_language","Dutch_language","Latin","Greek_language","Aristotle","Phocidae","Dorsal_fin","West_Africa","Newfoundland_(island)","Sea_of_Japan","Vladivostok","Bering_Strait","Alaska","British_Columbia","California","North_Sea","Gulf_of_Maine","Bay_of_Fundy","Herring","Capelin","Sprat","Pearlside","Great_white_shark","Killer_whale","University_of_Aberdeen","Scotland","Bottlenose_dolphin","Sperm_competition","Little_Belt","Denmark","Hunting","Greenland","Prehistoric","Alby_People","Oland","Sweden","Bonn_Convention","ASCOBANS","ACCOBAMS","Bycatch","Gill_nets","Black_Sea","Baltic_Sea","North_Sea","United_States","Canada","Animal_echolocation","Trawling","Sand_eel","Overfishing","Noise_pollution","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Pesticide","List_of_cetaceans","Marine_biology"]}
