{"cursor":"24617","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Hydrology' is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water on\nEarth and other planets, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and\nenvironmental watershed sustainability. A practitioner of hydrology is a\nhydrologist, working within the fields of earth or environmental science,\nphysical geography, geology or civil and environmental engineering.\n\nDomains of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface hydrology, hydrogeology,\ndrainage basin management and water quality, where water plays the central role.\nOceanography and meteorology are not included because water is only one of many\nimportant aspects within those fields.\n\nHydrological research can inform environmental engineering, policy and planning.\n\nThe term [[wiktionary:hydrology|hydrology]] is from Greek: , hydÅr, \"water\"; and\n, logos, \"study\".\n","linknr":606,"url":"Hydrology","recorded":1362505520,"links":96,"instances":["business","soil_science","pollution","agriculture","hydrology","pollution","systems","watercourse"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hydrology|","Hydraulic
