{"cursor":"16848","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Hemostasis' or 'haemostasis' (from the haimÃ³stasis \"styptic (drug)\") is a\nprocess which causes bleeding to stop, meaning to keep blood within a damaged\nblood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage). It is the first stage\nof wound healing. Most of the time this includes blood changing from a liquid to\na solid state. All situations that may lead to hemostasis are portrayed by the\nVirchow's triad. Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood's tendency\nto clot. The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a\nheparin-like molecule and thrombomodulin and prevent platelet aggregation with\nnitric oxide and prostacyclin. When endothelial injury occurs, the endothelial\ncells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead\nsecrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after\ninjury. Hemostasis has three major steps: 1) vasoconstriction, 2) temporary\nblockage of a break by a platelet plug, and 3) blood coagulation, or formation\nof a clot that seals the hole until tissues are repaired.\n","linknr":280,"url":"Hemostasis","recorded":1362565491,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hematology","Coagulation system"],"headings":["Steps of mechanism","Types of Hemostasis","Hemostasis in emergency medicine","Disorders","History of Artificial Hemostasis","Hemostatic Research","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Thrombocyteaggregation.jpg/220px-Thrombocyteaggregation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Antihemorrhagic","Bleeding","Wound_healing","Virchow's_triad","Clot","Endothelium","Thrombomodulin","Nitric_oxide","Prostacyclin","Von_Willebrand_factor","Platelets","Endothelium","Vasoconstriction","Endothelial_cells","Pain_receptors","Platelet","Adenosine_diphosphate","Serotonin","Thromboxane_A2","Von_Willebrand_factor","Clotting_factor","Fibrin","Fibrinogen","Fibrin","Prothrombin","Wound_healing","Stroke","Heart_attack","Pulmonary_embolism","Hemorrhaging","Chemical_agents","Hemostatic_agent","Collagen","Sutures","Hemophilia","Blood_clots","Embolus","Heart_attack","Pulmonary_embolism","Hemophilia","Ancient_Greek","Battle_of_Troy","Mummification","Genetic_disorders","Von_Willebrand_disease","Estrogen","Progesterone","Desmopressin"]}
