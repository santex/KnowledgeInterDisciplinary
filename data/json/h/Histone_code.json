{"cursor":"12112","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'histone code' is a hypothesis that the transcription of genetic information\nencoded in DNA is in part regulated by chemical modifications to histone\nproteins, primarily on their unstructured ends. Together with similar\nmodifications such as DNA methylation it is part of the epigenetic code. Histones associate with DNA to form nucleosomes, which\nthemselves bundle to form chromatin fibers, which in turn make up the more\nfamiliar chromosome. Histones are globular proteins with a flexible N-terminus\n(taken to be the tail) that protrudes from the nucleosome. Many of the histone\ntail modifications correlate very well to chromatin structure and both histone\nmodification state and chromatin structure correlate well to gene expression\nlevels. The critical concept of the 'histone code hypothesis' is that the\nhistone modifications serve to recruit other proteins by specific recognition of\nthe modified histone via protein domains specialized for such purposes, rather\nthan through simply stabilizing or destabilizing the interaction between histone\nand the underlying DNA. These recruited proteins then act to alter chromatin\nstructure actively or to promote transcription. For details of gene expression\nregulation by histone modifications see table below.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Histone_code","recorded":1362481183,"links":14,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.epigentek.com/docs/histonetable.pdf","http://www.activemotif.com/documents/1815.pdf"],"categories":["Epigenetics"],"headings":["The Hypothesis","Complexity of the histone code","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Hypothesis","DNA","Histone","DNA_methylation","Epigenetic_code","DNA","Nucleosome","Chromatin","Chromosome","N-terminus","Protein_domain","Chromatin","Methylation","Acetylation","Ubiquitination","Phosphorylation","Histone","Serine","Histone_H3","Serine","Lysine","Transcription_(genetics)","Methylation","Acetylation","Histone_acetyltransferase","HDAC","Chromatin","Phosphorylation","Ubiquitination","Mass_spectrometry","Methylation","Gene_activation","Gene_repression","Acetylation","Histone_H3","Nucleosome","Histone","Histone-Modifying_Enzymes"]}
