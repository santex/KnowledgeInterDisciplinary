Working argued that there could be hedgers on both sides of\nthe market and that hedging was essentially not a risk reduction technique, but\n\"speculation in the basis\" which allows informed traders and commodity dealers\nto profit from their knowledge of future changes in the difference between\nfutures and spot prices.\n\nA native of Fort Collins, Colorado, Working received his Ph.D. in Agricultural\nEconomics from the University of WisconsinâMadison in 1921. Before joining the\nFood Research Institute in 1925, he taught at Cornell University and the\nUniversity of Minnesota. His younger brother Elmer Working made a major\ncontribution on the identification problem for demand curves in econometrics,\nwith which Holbrook Working was also involved.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Econometric Society and was elected a Fellow of\nthe American Agricultural Economics Association, the American Statistical\nAssociation, and the American Association for the Advancement of\nScience.
