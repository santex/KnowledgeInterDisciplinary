Its main use is to treat certain\nbreast cancers.\n\nThe HER receptors are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane and\ncommunicate molecular signals from outside the cell (molecules called EGFs) to\ninside the cell, and turn genes on and off. The HER proteins stimulate cell\nproliferation. In some cancers, notably certain types of breast cancer, HER2 is\nover-expressed, and causes cancer cells to reproduce uncontrollably. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/1/39 Jul 5;357(1):39-\n51. Review /article]\n\nThe original studies of trastuzumab showed that it improved overall survival in\nlate-stage (metastatic) breast cancer from 20.3 to 25.1 months. In early stage breast cancer, it reduces the risk of cancer\nreturning after surgery by an absolute risk of 9.5%, and the risk of death by an\nabsolute risk of 3% however increases serious heart problems by an absolute risk\nof 2.1% which may resolve if treatment is stopped.\nTrastuzumab controversial partly because of its cost, as much as $54,000 per\nyear, and while certain private insurance companies in the\nU.S. and government health care systems in Canada, England and elsewhere have\nrefused to pay for trastuzumab for certain patients, some companies have since\naccepted trastuzumab treatment as a covered preventative treatment.\n\nTrastuzumab is also being studied for the treatment of other cancers.
