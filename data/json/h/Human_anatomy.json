Anatomy is subdivided into gross anatomy and\nmicroscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy (also called\ntopographical anatomy, regional anatomy, or anthropotomy) is the study of\nanatomical structures that can be seen by the naked eye. Microscopic anatomy is the study of minute anatomical structures assisted\nwith microscopes, which includes histology (the study of the organization of\ntissues), and cytology (the study of cells). Anatomy,\nhuman physiology (the study of function), and biochemistry (the study of the\nchemistry of living structures) are complementary basic medical sciences that\nare generally together (or in tandem) to students studying medical sciences.\n\nIn some of its facets human anatomy is closely related to embryology,\ncomparative anatomy and comparative embryology,\nthrough common roots in evolution; for example, much of the human body maintains\nthe ancient segmental pattern that is present in all vertebrates with basic\nunits being repeated, which is particularly obvious in the vertebral column and\nin the ribcage, and can be traced from very early embryos.\n\nThe human body consists of biological systems, that consist of organs, that\nconsist of tissues, that consist of cells and connective tissue.\n\nThe history of anatomy has been characterized, over a long period of time, by a\ncontinually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures\nin the body. Methods have also advanced dramatically, advancing from examination\nof animals through dissection of fresh and preserved cadavers (dead human\nbodies) to technologically complex techniques developed in the 20th century.\n","linknr":743,"url":"Human_anatomy","recorded":1362476973,"links":96,"instances":["anatomy","anatomy","anatomy","biology","anatomy","biology","human_anatomy","psychology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human
