More common examples include convertible and converting\npreference shares.\n\nA hybrid security is structured differently and while the price of some\nsecurities behave more like fixed interest securities, others behave more like\nthe underlying shares into which they convert.\n","linknr":176,"url":"Hybrid_security","recorded":1362543217,"links":18,"instances":["finance","finance","finance","finance"],"pdf":["http://www.ritceyteam.com/pdf/IntroToConverts_ClientFriendly.pdf","http://www.ritceyteam.com/pdf/IntroToConverts_ClientFriendly.pdf"],"categories":["Securities","Financial markets"],"headings":["Examples","Important terms","Traditional hybrids","Latest style of hybrids","Usage","Basket D security","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Vereinigte_Ostindische_Compagnie_bond.jpg/140px-Vereinigte_Ostindische_Compagnie_bond.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bond","finance"],["share","finance"],["option","finance"],["warrant","finance"]],"members":["bond","warrant","share","option"],"related":["Securities","Debt","Stock","Convertible_bond","Bond_(finance)","Share_(finance)","Option_(finance)","Income_security","PIK_loan","Warrant_(finance)","Moody's","Convertible_security","Convertible_debt","Monthly_income_preferred_stock","SWORD-financing","Shareholder_loan","Venture_lending"]}
