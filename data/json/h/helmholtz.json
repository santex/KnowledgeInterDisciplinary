In physiology and psychology, he\nis known for his mathematics of the eye, theories of vision, ideas on the visual\nperception of space, color vision research, and on the sensation of tone,\nperception of sound, and empiricism. In physics, he is known for his theories on\nthe conservation of energy, work in electrodynamics, chemical thermodynamics,\nand on a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics. As a philosopher, he is known\nfor his philosophy of science, ideas on the relation between the laws of\nperception and the laws of nature, the science of aesthetics, and ideas on the\ncivilizing power of science. The largest German association of research\ninstitutions, the Helmholtz Association, is named after him.<ref\nname=\"Cahan\"></ref>\n","title":"Hermann%20von%20Helmholtz","headings":["Biography","Research","Quotations","Students and associates","Honours and Legacy","See also","References","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Helmholtz_equation","3: Potsdam","3: Physics","3: Physiology","3: Psychology","3: Wilhelm_Wundt","3: Helmholtz_resonance","2: Charlottenburg","2: Wilhelm_Wien","2: Michael_I._Pupin","2: Henry_Augustus_Rowland","2: Conservation_of_energy","2: Helmholtz_decomposition","2: Helmholtz_free_energy","2: Helmholtz_pitch_notation","2: Helmholtz's_theorems","2: KelvinâHelmholtz_instability","2: YoungâHelmholtz_theory","2: Physicist","2: Human_eye","2: Color_vision","2: Energy","2: Mechanics","2: Research_institution","2: Helmholtz_Association_of_German_Research_Centres","1: Kingdom_of_Prussia","1: Germans","1: German_Empire","1: University_of_KÃ¶nigsberg","1: University_of_Bonn","1: University_of_Heidelberg","1: University_of_Berlin","1: Johannes_Peter_MÃ¼ller","1: Albert_Abraham_Michelson","1: William_James","1: Heinrich_Hertz","1: Friedrich_Schottky","1: Arthur_Gordon_Webster","1: Otto_Lummer","1: Edward_Nichols","1: Ludwig_Wittgenstein","1: Helmholtz_condition","1: Free_entropy","1: Helmholtz_layer","1: Helmholtz_reciprocity","1: Helmholtz_temperament","1: Generalized_Helmholtz_theorem","1: GibbsâHelmholtz_equation","1: Helmholtz-Ellis_notation","1: HelmholtzâKohlrausch_effect","1: Helmholtz-Smoluchowski_equation","1: KelvinâHelmholtz_mechanism","1: Additive_synthesis","1: Efference_copy","1: Hydrodynamic_stability","1: Keratometer","1: Pure_tone","1: Supercapacitor","1: Agnostic","1: Physician","1: Theory_of_vision","1: Visual_perception","1: Empiricism","1: Electrodynamics","1: Chemical_thermodynamics","1: Thermodynamics","1: Philosopher","1: Science","1: Laws_of_nature","1: Aesthetics","1: Classical_philology","1: Philology","1: Philosophy","1: Immanuel_Hermann_Fichte","1: Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte","1: Immanuel_Kant","1: CharitÃ©","1: Age_of_the_Earth","1: Solar_system","1: Muscle","1: Metabolism","1: Nicolas_LÃ©onard_Sadi_Carnot","1: Ãmile_Clapeyron","1: James_Prescott_Joule","1: Heat","1: Light","1: Electricity","1: Magnetism","1: Julius_Robert_von_Mayer","1: Plagiarism","1: William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin","1: William_Rankine","1: Heat_death_of_the_universe","1: Naturphilosophie","1: Materialism","1: Ophthalmology","1: Ophthalmoscope","1: Depth_perception","1: Motion_perception","1: Optical_Society_of_America","1: Accommodation_reflex","1: Ewald_Hering","1: Galvanometer","1: Audio_frequency","1: Sine_wave","1: Fourier_analysis#Applications_in_signal_processing","1: Vowel","1: Alexander_Graham_Bell","1: Harmonic_telegraph","1: Alexander_J._Ellis","1: Heidelberg","1: Electromagnetism","1: Heinrich_Rudolf_Hertz","1: Electromagnetic_radiation","1: Oliver_Heaviside","1: Longitudinal_wave","1: Maxwell's_equations","1: Physical_Review","1: International_Journal_of_Theoretical_Physics","1: Optics_and_Photonics_News","1: Max_Planck","1: Heinrich_Kayser","1: Eugen_Goldstein","1: Arthur_KÃ¶nig","1: A._A._Michelson","1: Fernando_Sanford","1: Leo_Koenigsberger","1: Institution_of_Engineers_and_Shipbuilders_in_Scotland","1: Helmholtz_coil","1: Helmholtz_machine","1: ThÃ©venin's_theorem","1: Marx_W._Wartofsky","1: Internet_Archive","1: Karlsruhe","1: Virtual_Laboratory","1: Max_Planck_Institute_for_the_History_of_Science","1: Physiologist"]}
