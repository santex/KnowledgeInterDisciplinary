In sociology, behavior in general is\nconsidered as having no meaning, being not directed at other people, and thus\nis the most basic human action. Behavior in this general sense should not be\nmistaken with social behavior, which is a more advanced action, as social\nbehavior is behavior specifically directed at other people. The acceptability\nof behavior is evaluated relative to social norms and regulated by various\nmeans of social control.\n\nThe behavior of humans is studied by the academic disciplines of psychiatry,\npsychology, social work, sociology, economics, and anthropology.\n\nHuman behaviour is experienced throughout an individualâs entire lifetime. It\nincludes the way they act based on different factors such as genetics, social\nnorms, core faith, and attitude. Behaviour is impacted by certain traits each\nindividual has. The traits vary from person to person and can produce different\nactions or behaviour from each person. Social norms also impact behaviour.\nHumans are expected to follow certain rules in society, which conditions the way\npeople behave. There are certain behaviours that are acceptable or unacceptable\nin different societies and cultures. Core faith can be perceived through the\nreligion and philosophy of that individual. It shapes the way a person thinks\nand this in turn results in different human behaviours. Attitude can be defined\nas \"the degree to which the person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation of\nthe behavior in question.\" Your attitude highly reflects the behaviour you will\nportray in specific situations. Thus, human behavior is greatly influenced by\nthe attitudes we use on a daily basis.\n","recorded":1362124214,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"83","instances":["sociology","personal_and_cultural","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.uc.pt/en/cia/publica/AP_artigos/AP24.25.09_Teixeira.pdf"],"categories":["Behavior","Human behavior|"],"headings":["Factors affecting human behavior and actions","See also","References"],"tags":[["attitude","psychology"],["value","personal_and_cultural"],["norm","sociology"],["attitude","psychology"],["value","personal_and_cultural"],["norm","sociology"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Behavior","Culture","Attitude_(psychology)","Emotion","Value_(personal_and_cultural)","Ethics","Authority","Rapport","Hypnosis","Persuasion","Coercion","Genetics","Organism","Social_deviance","Sociology","Social_action","Social_behavior","Norm_(sociology)","Social_control","Academic_discipline","Psychiatry","Psychology","Social_work","Sociology","Economics","Anthropology","Behavioral_modernity","Behaviorism","Feminine_psychology","Human_behavioral_ecology","Human_ethology","Human_sexual_behavior","Masculine_psychology","Mathematical_principles_of_reinforcement","Mociology","Motivation","Nature_versus_nurture","American_Humanist_Association"],"members":["norm","value","attitude"],"book":[]}
