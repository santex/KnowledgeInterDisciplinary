It is generally a place to provide safety and is used as a center\nfrom which people or animals base their daily activities. Most modern-day\nhouseholds contain sanitary facilities and a means of preparing food. Animals\nhave their own homes as well, either living in the wild or shared with humans in\na domesticated environment. Home might have a Sanskrit aham (self) or akam\n(self) in Tamil as its etymology. \"Lh\n\nHome is also used to refer to the geographical area (whether it be a suburb,\ntown, city or country) in which a person grew up or feels they belong, or it can\nrefer to the native habitat of a wild animal. There are cultures in which homes\nare mobile such as nomadic peoples. Sometimes, as an alternative to the\ndefinition of home as a physical locale (\"Home is where you hang your\nhat\"<ref></ref>), home may be perceived to have no physical location, instead,\nhome may relate instead to a mental or emotional state of refuge or comfort.\nPopular sayings along these lines are \"Home is where the heart is\"<ref></ref> or\n\"You can never go home again\".\n",
