Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland\n1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.i p.75 He was praised for his good\nservice to the Crown, but later accused of oppression.\n\nAlthough he may have been born in England, he belonged to the Anglo-Irish de\nBurgh dynasty; he was a cousin of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of\nUlster, Ball p.75 and later acted as attorney for the Earl's daughter\nand heiress Elizabeth. Ball p.75 Despite later complaints about his\nconduct, he was at least better qualified for the Bench than some of his\ncolleagues, since Barons of the Irish Exchequer in particular were often accused\nthen of being deficient in knowledge of the law. Ball p.18 As was then\ncommon for those seeking a career on the Bench, he was in holy orders.\n\nHe was in the service of the Crown in 1331 when he visited Ireland; and later\nbecame Irish attorney to Queen Philippa of Hainault. Ball p.75 In 1335\nhe became third Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). In 1337 he was\ncontinued in office for four years in consideration of past good service, and\nshortly after became Chief Baron. He was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal of\nIreland in 1339 and Lord Treasurer in 1340. He was reappointed Chief Baron in\n1344. Ball p.75\n\nIn 1347 he was accused of misconduct, and a commission of oyer and terminer was\nset up to inquire into his official oppression: precisely what form the\noppression took is unclear: later charges against his successor John de Burnham\nwere concerned with fraud and financial mismanagement, and it seems that the\nPrivy Council of Ireland had some doubts about de Burgh's honesty. Otway-\nRuthven, A.J. History of Medieval Ireland Reprinted Barnes and Noble 1993\np.266 This was part of a wider dissatisfaction with the King's ministers\nand the commission was soon extended into a general examination of official wrongdoing. Otway-\nRuthven p.266 John de Burnham, an English Crown official with long\nexperience of financial administration was sent to Ireland as Treasurer to\nreform the perceived abuses, only to spend much of his career fighting similar\ncharges. The following year de Burgh went to England to justify himself and\nreceived a pardon. He remained Chief Baron until 1351 when he probably\ndied. Ball
