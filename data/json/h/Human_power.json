It can\nalso refer to the power (rate of work per time) of a human. Power comes\nprimarily from muscles, but body heat is also used to do work like warming\nshelters, food, or other humans.\n\nWorld records of power performance by humans are of interest to work planners\nand work-process engineers. The average level of human power that can be\nmaintained over a certain duration of time, say over the extent of one minute or\none hour is interesting to engineers designing work operations in industry.\nHuman power is sometimes used to generate electricity that is stored.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Human_power","recorded":1362664890,"links":14,"instances":["building","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human power|"],"headings":["Human-powered transport","Human-powered equipment","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Crystal_Clear_action_run.png/30px-Crystal_Clear_action_run.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["work","physics"],["power","physics"],["shelter","building"],["power","physics#mechanical_power"]],"members":["shelter","power","work"],"related":["Work_(physics)","Energy","Human_body","Power_(physics)","List_of_muscles_of_the_human_body","Body_heat","Shelter_(building)","Transport","Bicycle","Wheelchair","Walking","Skateboard","Wheelbarrow","Watercraft_rowing","Ski","Pulled_rickshaw","Galley"]}
