{"cursor":"19630","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Hybridization comprises the fusion of country- and culture-specific election\ncampaigning methods with contemporary styles and techniques. Originally deriving\nfrom biology, where the term hybridizations denotes the process of combining\ndifferent varieties of organism to create a hybrid, the term is transferred to\nthe field of political communication when a hybrid election campaign arises. One\nmain aspect of this concept is the emphasis on an international comparative\nperspective. In Globalization theory the term hybridization means the ongoing\nblending of cultures, which denotes in political campaign communication also the\nblending of political cultures.\n","linknr":213,"url":"Hybridization_in_political_election_campaign_communication","recorded":1362890732,"links":13,"instances":["social","media_systems","research","disambiguation","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Election campaigns"],"headings":["Characteristics","Earlier approaches","Examples: hybridization around the world","Criticism","Notes","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Political_culture_and_its_three_dimensions.png/220px-Political_culture_and_its_three_dimensions.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Contextual_constraints_on_campaign_style.png/220px-Contextual_constraints_on_campaign_style.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Evolution_of_theoretical_approaches.png/220px-Evolution_of_theoretical_approaches.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["norm","social"],["variable","research"],["hybridisation","disambiguation"],["transformation_processes","media_systems"]],"members":["norm","transformation_processes","variable","hybridisation","hybrid"],"related":["Biology","Hybrid_(biology)","Political_communication","Election_campaign","Globalization","Political_culture","Political_culture","Mass_media","Data_mining","Electoral_system","Party_system","Mass_media","Norm_(social)","Mass_media","Modernization","Endogenous","Professionalization","Marketing","Public_relations","Americanization","Diffusion","Sweden","Analysis","Ecuador","Japan","House_of_Representatives_of_Japan","Voting_system","Parliament_of_Japan","Variable_(research)","Political_campaign","Hybridisation_(disambiguation)","Research_strategies_of_election_campaign_communication_research","Americanization","Globalization","Modernization","Transformation_processes_(media_systems)"]}
