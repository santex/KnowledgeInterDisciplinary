{"cursor":"29388","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" was an early example of biotechnology]]\n\n'[[Biotechnology]]' is the application of scientific and engineering principles\nto the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and\nservices. Bud, The Uses of Life, p. 1 From its inception,\nbiotechnology has maintained a close relationship with society. Although now\nmost often associated with the development of drugs, historically biotechnology\nhas been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as\nmalnutrition and famine. The history of biotechnology begins with\nzymotechnology, which commenced with a focus on brewing techniques for beer. By\nWorld War I, however, zymotechnology would expand to tackle larger industrial\nissues, and the potential of industrial fermentation gave rise to\nbiotechnology.However, both the single-cell protein and gasohol projects failed\nto progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing\neconomic scene, and shifts in political power.\n\nYet the formation of a new field, genetic engineering, would soon bring\nbiotechnology to the forefront of science in society, and the intimate\nrelationship between the scientific community, the public, and the government\nwould ensue. These debates gained exposure in 1975 at the Asilomar Conference,\nwhere Joshua Lederberg was the most outspoken supporter for this emerging field\nin biotechnology. By as early as 1978, with the synthesis of synthetic human\ninsulin, Lederberg's claims would prove valid, and the biotechnology industry\ngrew rapidly. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to\ncapture public support, and by the 1980s, biotechnology grew into a promising\nreal industry. In 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had\nbeen approved as drugs by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\nbut this number would skyrocket to over 125 by the end of the 1990s.\n\nThe field of genetic engineering remains a heated topic of discussion in today's\nsociety with the advent of gene therapy, stem cell research, cloning, and\ngenetically modified food. While it seems only natural nowadays to link\npharmaceutical drugs as solutions to health and societal problems, this\nrelationship of biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago.\n","linknr":507,"url":"History_of_Biotechnology","recorded":1362504048,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ebrd.com/projects/eias/38645sume.pdf"],"categories":["History of biology by subdiscipline|Biotechnology, history of","History of technology|Biotechnology, history of","Biotechnology"],"headings":["Origins of biotechnology","Single-cell protein and gasohol projects","Genetic engineering","Biotechnology and industry","Global trends","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/The_Brewer_designed_and_engraved_in_the_Sixteenth._Century_by_J_Amman.png/250px-The_Brewer_designed_and_engraved_in_the_Sixteenth._Century_by_J_Amman.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Penicillin_cures_gonorrhea.jpg/220px-Penicillin_cures_gonorrhea.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Insulincrystals.jpg/220px-Insulincrystals.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/South_San_Francisco_gateway_sign.jpg/220px-South_San_Francisco_gateway_sign.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/HomunculusLarge.png/60px-HomunculusLarge.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Drug","Malnutrition","Famine","Biotechnology","Brewing","Industrial_fermentation","Genetic_engineering","Asilomar_Conference","Joshua_Lederberg","Insulin","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Gene_therapy","Stem_cell_research","Cloning","Genetically_modified_food","Brewing","Max_Delbruck","Lactic_acid","Glycerol","Acetone","Industrial_fermentation","Karl_Ereky","Prohibition","Penicillin","Steroids","Cortisone","British_Petroleum","Alfred_Champagnat","Grangemouth_Refinery","Single-cell_protein","MIT","Alkane","Soviet_Union","Kstovo","Kirishi","Price_of_oil","Petroleum","Gasohol","Iran-Iraq_war","Ronald_Reagan","Genetic_engineering","Genetic_engineering","DNA","Recombinant_DNA","Arthur_Kornberg","Beta_thalassemia","Sickle-cell_anemia","Star_Trek","Cloning","Woody_Allen","Adolf_Hitler","Ira_Levin","Recombinant_DNA","Joshua_Lederberg","Nobel_laureate","Human_genome","Euphenics","Phenotype","Genotype","Recombinant_DNA","Asilomar_Conference_Grounds","National_Institutes_of_Health","Joshua_Lederberg","Asilomar_Conference_Grounds","Proteins","Industrial_fermentation","Microbes","Antibiotics","Modified_organisms","Recombinant_DNA","Genetic_engineering","Recombinant_DNA","Insulin","Type_1_diabetes","Human_insulin","Genentech","Eli_Lilly_and_Company","Industrial_microbiology","Biotechnology_Industry_Organization","Human_growth_hormone","Interferon","Cancer","Biogen","Interferon","AIDS","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Insulin","Human_growth_hormone","Hepatitis_B_vaccine","Alpha-interferon","Tissue_plasminogen_activator","Flavr_Savr_tomato","Genetic_engineering","Latin_America","Breast_cancer","Timeline_of_biotechnology","Genetically_modified_organism","Green_Revolution"]}
