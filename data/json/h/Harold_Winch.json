{"cursor":"4628","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Harold Edward Winch' (18 June 1907 in Loughton, England - 1 February 1993) was\na Canadian politician active with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)\nand its successor, the New Democratic Party (NDP).\n\nWinch was leader of the British Columbia CCF from 1938 to 1953, and Leader of\nthe Opposition from 1941. He was called \"the best leader of the Opposition that\nhas ever been\" by Premier W.A.C.\nBennett[http://conservativeforum.org/authquot.asp?ID=339].\n\nWinch was active during the relief camp strike in Vancouver that precipitated\nthe On-to-Ottawa Trek in 1935, acting as a liaison between unemployed protesters\nand the government. He performed the same role as a new MLA in 1938, and\nassisted the police in ending a month-long occupation at the Vancouver Art\nGallery on what became known as \"Bloody Sunday.\"\n\nLike other CCFers (such as Grace and Angus\nMacInnis), http://www.wernercohn.com/Japanese.html Winch and the BC\nCCF supported the internment of Japanese Canadians during World War II. Decades\nlater, he conceded that this position was wrong.\n[http://www.wernercohn.com/Japanese.html]\n\nAn electrician by trade, Winch joined the CCF at its founding. He was first\nelected to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in the 1933 provincial\nelection as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Vancouver East. He\nbecame leader of the party following the 1937 general election and leader of the\nopposition in 1941. The CCF emerged from the 1952 provincial election with only\none less seat than the British Columbia Social Credit Party. Social Credit\nformed a minority government, but was defeated in a motion of no confidence in\nMarch 1953. Winch opposed holding a new election, arguing that the CCF was able\nto form a new government. When the Liberal Party announced that it would not\nsupport a CCF government, a new election was called.\n\nWinch stepped down as party leader, and entered federal politics. He was elected\nto the Canadian House of Commons in the 1953 federal election as the Member of\nParliament for Vancouver East.\n\nWinch survived the 1958 federal election that almost wiped the CCF out, and\nremained with the party as it transformed into the New Democratic Party in 1961.\nAfter winning seven successive elections as an MP, he retired from the House of\nCommons at the 1972 federal election.\n\nHarold Winch's father, Ernest Edward Winch was also a CCF MLA from 1933 until\nhis death in 1957.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Harold_Winch","recorded":1375075450,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Harold_Edward_Winch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Harold_Edward_Winch&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Harold_Edward_Winch","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Harold_Winch&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Loughton","/wiki/England","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation","/wiki/New_Democratic_Party_(Canada)","/wiki/British_Columbia_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(British_Columbia)","/wiki/Premier_of_British_Columbia","/wiki/W.A.C._Bennett","http://conservativeforum.org/authquot.asp?ID=339","/wiki/Relief_Camp_Workers%27_Union","/wiki/On-to-Ottawa_Trek","/wiki/Vancouver_Art_Gallery","/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1938)","/wiki/Grace_MacInnis","/wiki/Angus_MacInnis","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Japanese_Canadians","/wiki/World_War_II","http://www.wernercohn.com/Japanese.html","/wiki/British_Columbia_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1933","/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly","/wiki/Vancouver_East_(electoral_district)","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1937","/wiki/British_Columbia_general_election,_1952","/wiki/British_Columbia_Social_Credit_Party","/wiki/Minority_government","/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence","/wiki/British_Columbia_Liberal_Party","/wiki/Canadian_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_1953","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Vancouver_East","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_1958","/wiki/Canadian_federal_election,_1972","/wiki/Ernest_Edward_Winch","/w/index.php?title=Harold_Edward_Winch&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.wernercohn.com/Japanese.html","/wiki/Robert_Connell_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/British_Columbia_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Arnold_Webster","/wiki/Royal_Lethington_Maitland","/wiki/List_of_Leaders_of_the_Opposition_in_British_Columbia","/wiki/Arnold_Webster","/wiki/Angus_MacInnis","/wiki/Vancouver_East","/wiki/Paddy_Neale","/wiki/Template:BC_NDP_Leaders","/wiki/Template_talk:BC_NDP_Leaders","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:BC_NDP_Leaders&action=edit","/wiki/British_Columbia_New_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Robert_Connell","/wiki/Arnold_Webster","/wiki/Robert_Strachan","/wiki/Thomas_R._Berger","/wiki/Dave_Barrett","/wiki/Bob_Skelly","/wiki/Mike_Harcourt","/wiki/Glen_Clark","/wiki/Dan_Miller_(Canadian_politician)","/wiki/Ujjal_Dosanjh","/wiki/Joy_MacPhail","/wiki/Carole_James","/wiki/Dawn_Black","/wiki/Adrian_Dix","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harold_Edward_Winch&oldid=524668074","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1907_births","/wiki/Category:1993_deaths","/wiki/Category:Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation_MPs","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_Canada_from_British_Columbia","/wiki/Category:British_Columbia_Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation_MLAs","/wiki/Category:Canadian_people_of_English_descent","/wiki/Category:Canadian_socialists","/wiki/Category:Canadian_people_of_Australian_descent","/wiki/Category:Leaders_of_the_British_Columbia_CCF/NDP","/wiki/Category:People_from_Loughton","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Harold+Edward+Winch&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Harold+Edward+Winch","/wiki/Harold_Edward_Winch","/wiki/Talk:Harold_Edward_Winch","#","/wiki/Harold_Edward_Winch","/w/index.php?title=Harold_Edward_Winch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Harold_Edward_Winch&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Harold_Edward_Winch","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Harold_Edward_Winch","/wiki/Wik
