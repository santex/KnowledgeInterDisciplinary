{"cursor":"36845","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\nThe 'Human Genome Project' ('HGP') is an international scientific research\nproject with a primary goal of determining the sequence of chemical base pairs\nwhich make up DNA, and of identifying and mapping the approximately\n20,000â25,000 genes of the human genome from both a physical and functional\nstandpoint.\n\nThe project began in October 1990 and was initially headed by\nAristides Patrinos, head of the Office of Biological and Environmental Research\nin the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. Francis Collins directed\nthe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Human Genome Research\nInstitute efforts. A working draft of the genome was announced in 2000 and a\ncomplete one in 2003, with further, more detailed analysis still being\npublished. A parallel project was conducted outside of government by the Celera\nCorporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of\nthe government-sponsored sequencing was performed in universities and research\ncentres from the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany and\nSpain. Researchers continue to identify protein-coding genes and their\nfunctions; the objective is to find disease-causing genes and possibly use the\ninformation to develop more specific treatments. It also may be possible to\nlocate patterns in gene expression, which could help physicians glean insight\ninto the body's emergent properties.\n\nWhile the objective of the Human Genome Project is to understand the genetic\nmakeup of the human species, the project has also focused on several other\nnonhuman organisms such as [[E. coli]], the fruit fly, and the laboratory mouse.\nIt remains one of the largest single investigative projects in modern science.\n\nThe Human Genome Project originally aimed to map the nucleotides contained in a\nhuman haploid reference genome (more than three billion). Several groups have\nannounced efforts to extend this to diploid human genomes including the\nInternational HapMap Project, Applied Biosystems, Perlegen, Illumina, J. Craig\nVenter Institute, Personal Genome Project, and Roche-454.\n\nThe \"genome\" of any given individual (except for identical twins and cloned\norganisms) is unique; mapping \"the human genome\" involves sequencing multiple\nvariations of each gene. The project did not study the entire DNA\nfound in human cells; some heterochromatic areas (about 8% of the total genome)\nremain un-sequenced.\n\nCritics warn that this research would make it easier to create ethnic bioweapons\ntargeted towards specific populations.
