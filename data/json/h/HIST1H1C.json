Two molecules\n| of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer,\n| around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called\n| nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between\n| nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order\n| structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H1\n| family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a\n| palindromic termination element. This gene is found in the large histone gene\n| cluster on chromosome 6.\n}}\n\nApart from its roles in the nucleus, histone H1.2 also participates in\napoptosis. In response to apoptotic stimuli, mainly DNA damage, it is\ntranslocated from the nucleus to the cytosol. There, it activates Bak, a pro-\napoptotic protein bound to the mithochondria outer membrane (MOM). Activation of\nBak causes the perforation of the mitochondria, a process known as MOMP\n(mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization) which promotes apoptosis. Histone\nH1.2 also forms a complex with the apoptosome, possibly regulating its\nformation.\n","linknr":190,"url":"HIST1H1C","recorded":1362481018,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/PBB_GE_HIST1H1C_209398_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_HIST1H1C_209398_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene"]}
