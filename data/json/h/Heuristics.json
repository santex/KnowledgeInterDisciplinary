{"cursor":"28010","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Heuristic' (; or /hyoo-'ris'-tik/; Greek: \"Îá½ÏÎ¯ÏÎºÏ\", '\"find\"' or '\"discover\"')\nrefers to experience-based techniques for problem solving, learning, and\ndiscovery. Where the exhaustive search is impractical, heuristic methods are\nused to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution; mental short\ncuts to ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples of this method\ninclude using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgment, or\ncommon sense.\n\nIn more precise terms, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible,\nthough loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human\nbeings and machines.
