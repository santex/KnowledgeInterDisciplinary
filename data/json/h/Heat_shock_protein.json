{"cursor":"19205","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Heat shock proteins' ('HSP') are a class of functionally related proteins\ninvolved in the folding and unfolding of other proteins. Their expression is\nincreased when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or other stress. This increase in expression is transcriptionally\nregulated. The dramatic upregulation of the heat shock proteins is a key part of\nthe heat shock response and is induced primarily by heat shock factor (HSF). HSPs are found in virtually all living organisms, from\nbacteria to humans.\n\nHeat-shock proteins are named according to their molecular weight. For example,\nHsp60, Hsp70 and Hsp90 (the most widely-studied HSPs) refer to families of heat\nshock proteins on the order of 60, 70, and 90 kilodaltons in size,\nrespectively. The small 8-kilodalton protein\nubiquitin, which marks proteins for degradation, also has features of a heat\nshock protein.\n","linknr":538,"url":"Heat_shock_protein","recorded":1362372929,"links":23,"instances":["biology","medical","protein","genetics","rose_element","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Heat shock proteins|"],"headings":["Discovery","Function","Clinical significance","Applications","Classification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["chaperone","protein"],["stress","biology"],["hypoxia","medical"],["repression_of_heat_shock_gene_expression","rose_element"],["chaperone","protein"],["7,12-dimethylbenz(aanthracene"],["splicing","genetics"],["chaperone","protein"],["repression_of_heat_shock_gene_expression","rose_element"]],"members":["stress","hypoxia","chaperone","splicing","repression_of_heat_shock_gene_expression","transcription","cell"],"related":["Protein","Cell_(biology)","Transcription_(genetics)","Downregulation_and_upregulation","Heat_shock_factor","Bacteria","Human","HSP60","Hsp70","Hsp90","Atomic_mass_unit","Ubiquitin","Ferruccio_Ritossa","2,4-Dinitrophenol","Chromosome","Drosophila","Chaperone_(protein)","Stress_(biology)","Infection","Inflammation","Ethanol","Arsenic","Trace_metal","Ultraviolet","Starvation","Hypoxia_(medical)","Oxygen","Downregulation_and_upregulation","FourU_thermometer","Repression_of_heat_shock_gene_expression_(ROSE)_element","Hsp90_cis-regulatory_element","Chaperone_(protein)","Chemical_conformation","Proteasome","Hsp84","Hsp27","Hsp20","Alpha_B_crystallin","Hsp90","Endothelial_NOS","Guanylate_cyclase","Protein_kinase_G","Hsp70","Antigen","Immune_system","HSF1","Carcinogenesis","Knockout_mice","7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene","Mutagen","Antigen_presentation","Immunologic_adjuvant","Vaccine","Small_molecule","HSP_inhibitor","Hsp90","17-N-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin","Clinical_trial","HSP33","HSP60","Hsp70","Hsp90","HSP100","SHSP","Molecular_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","GroES","Hsp27","HSPB6","Hsp40","GroEL","Hsp70","Hsp70","HSPA1A","Hsp90","Co-chaperone","Splicing_(genetics)","Chaperone_(protein)","Chaperonin","Co-chaperone","FourU_thermometer","Hsp90_cis-regulatory_element","Repression_of_heat_shock_gene_expression_(ROSE)_element"]}
