The colloquial term heavy water is often also used to refer a highly\nenriched water mixture that contains mostly deuterium oxide but also contains\nsome ordinary water molecules as well: for instance heavy water used in CANDU\nreactors is 99.75% enriched by hydrogen atom-fraction, meaning that 99.75% of\nthe hydrogen atoms are of the heavy type. In comparison, in ordinary water,\nwhich is the \"ordinary water\" used for a deuterium standard on Earth, there are\nonly about 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms.\n\nHeavy water is not radioactive. In its pure form, it has a density about 11%\ngreater than water, but otherwise, is physically and chemically similar.\nNevertheless, the various differences in deuterium-containing water (especially\naffecting the biological properties) are larger than in any other commonly\noccurring isotope-substituted compound because deuterium is unique among heavy\nstable isotopes in being twice as heavy as the lightest isotope. This difference\nincreases the strength of water's hydrogen-oxygen bonds, and this in turn is\nenough to cause differences that are important to some biochemical reactions.\nThe human body naturally contains deuterium equivalent to about five grams of\nheavy water, which is harmless. When a large fraction of water (> 50%) in higher\norganisms is replaced by heavy water, the result is cell dysfunction and\ndeath.\n\nHeavy water was first produced in 1932, a few months after the discovery of deuterium. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/fac-\nbios/brus/group/pages/urey.html Harold Clayton Urey (1893â1981)] With the\ndiscovery of nuclear fission in late 1938, and the need for a neutron moderator\nthat captured few neutrons, heavy water became a component of early nuclear\nenergy. Since then, heavy water has been an essential component in some types of\nreactor, both those that generate power and those designed to produce isotopes\nfor nuclear weapons, such as plutonium-239. These heavy water reactors have the\nadvantage of being able to run on natural uranium without the use of graphite\nmoderators which can pose radiological [http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/ngwm-cd/PDF-\nFiles/paper%2017%20(Holt).pdf] and dust explosion [http://cigr.ageng2-\n012.org/images/fotosg/tabla_137_C0371.pdf] hazards in the decommissioning\nphase. Most modern reactors use enriched uranium and normal \"light water\"\n(H 2O) moderator.\n","linknr":650,"url":"Heavy_water","recorded":1362372257,"links":78,"instances":["north_america","unit","unit","molecule"],"pdf":["http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/ngwm-cd/PDF-Files/paper%2017%20(Holt).pdf","http://cigr.ageng2012.org/images/fotosg/tabla_137_C0371.pdf","http://www.cns-snc.ca/Bulletin/A_Miller_Heavy_Water.pdf"],"categories":["Forms
