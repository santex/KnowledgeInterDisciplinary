The English and\nWelsh derivations mean \"son of Hob\". It derives from the Germanic warrior name\nHrod-berht, translated as \"renowned-fame\". It was 'borrowed' into French, where\nthe spelling was changed from \"Hob\" to \"Robert\". The name in Ireland is an\nAnglicisation of the Irish Gaelic name Mac Oibicin. The name increased in\npopularity in, and became associated with, Wales around the 17th century. The\nRobert spelling was introduced to England and Scotland after the Norman conquest\nof England.\n","title":"hopkins","headings":["People surnamed Hopkins","Fictional characters","References","See also"]},"micro-relation":["3: Wales","3: England","3: Ireland","2: Irish_language","2: Hopkin","2: Juliet_Opie_Hopkins","1: Scotland","1: English_language","1: Welsh_language","1: Robert","1: Patronymic_surname","1: Anglicisation","1: Norman_conquest_of_England","1: Anthony_Hopkins","1: Antony_Hopkins","1: Arthur_F._Hopkins","1: Bernard_Hopkins","1: Bert_Hopkins","1: Bobb_Hopkins","1: Brad_Hopkins","1: Cathy_Hopkins","1: Christian_Hopkins","1: Claude_Hopkins","1: Claude_C._Hopkins","1: Constance_Hopkins","1: Edward_Hopkins","1: Frank_Hopkins","1: Frederick_Gowland_Hopkins","1: Gareth_Hopkins","1: Bonnie_Tyler","1: Gerard_Manley_Hopkins","1: Graham_Hopkins","1: Harold_Hopkins","1: Harry_Hopkins","1: Herbert_Hopkins","1: Isaac_S._Hopkins","1: Jeff_Hopkins","1: Jeffrey_Hopkins","1: Johns_Hopkins","1: Jon_Hopkins","1: Keith_Hopkins","1: Lightnin'_Hopkins","1: Tera_Patrick","1: Lisa_Hopkins","1: Matthew_Hopkins","1: Maudie_Hopkins","1: Mel_Hopkins","1: Milton_N._Hopkins","1: Nathan_T._Hopkins","1: Nelson_K._Hopkins","1: Nicky_Hopkins","1: Paul_Hopkins","1: Peter_W._Hopkins","1: Roy_M._Hopkins","1: Sarah_Hopkins","1: Telma_Hopkins","1: Tiffany_Hopkins","1: Tim_Hopkins","1: Wes_Hopkins","1: Jimmy_Hopkins"]}
