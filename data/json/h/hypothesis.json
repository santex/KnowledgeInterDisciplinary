Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on\nprevious observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available\nscientific theories. Even though the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" are often\nused synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific\ntheory]]. A scientific hypothesis is a proposed explanation of a phenomenon\nwhich still has to be rigorously tested.
