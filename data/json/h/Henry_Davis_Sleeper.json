{"cursor":"6048","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Henry Davis Sleeper' (1878-1934) was a nationally-noted antiquarian,\ncollector, and interior decorator. He was born March 27, 1878, in Boston to\nMajor Jacob Henry Sleeper, a distinguished Civil War veteran and Maria Westcott\nSleeper, their youngest son after Jacob and Stephen. He was grandson of Jacob\nSleeper, one of the founders of Boston University as well as a clothier and\nmanager of a real estate trust. Henry's education appears to have been by\nprivate tutors due to ill health as a child. No record of formal higher\neducation has come to light.\n\nHenry Sleeper was introduced to the Eastern Point in Gloucester, Massachusetts\nin the spring of 1906 by the Harvard economist A. Piatt Andrew who had built a\nhandsome summer mansion, Red Roof, on a rock ledge above the harbor. Sleeper was\nmuch taken by the location and immediately decided to build a little further\nalong the ledge from Red Roof. Eastern Point was an enclave occupied by a\nsomewhat louche group of \"Bohemian\" artists and intellectuals with frequent\nvisits from some of the more colorful and unconventional members of Boston\nSociety, in particular Isabella Stewart Gardner, the legendary art collector and\nbuilder of Fenway Court in the Back Bay Fens, now the Isabella Stewart Gardner\nMuseum. The group became known as Dabsville, DABS containing the initials of the\ncore members .\n\nConstruction of Beauport, Sleeper's relatively modestly scaled Arts and Crafts-\nstyle house began in the fall of 1907 and was sufficiently finished to receive\nA. Piatt Andrew as a house guest in May of 1908. As property flanking Sleeper's\nbecame available, Beauport was expanded several times until 1925, often in\nresponse to events or important experiences in his life. The house was now not\nonly a home but a major showcase for Sleeper's interior design and decoration\nbusiness. Clients could choose wallpapers, window treatments, or entire rooms to\nhave reproduced in their own houses. Sleeper had a specialty in \"Puritan\nRevival,\" the Jacobean-American architecture and decorative arts of the original\nAmerican colonies, but his tastes and interests included French decor of several\ncenturies and a great deal of orientalia.\n\nSleeper became the U.S. Representative, and a major fundraiser for the American\nField Service, an ambulance corps founded by A. Piatt Andrew early during World\nWar I. While Andrew served in the battle zones, Sleeper criss crossed the\nAtlantic with supplies and funds, and worked closely with the French Military.\nFrance awarded him the Croix de Guerre and the Legion of Honor.\n\nAfter the War, Sleeper's practice expanded and he won national recognition via\nprestigious periodicals and several high-visibility clients. Isabella Stewart\nGardner commissined work from him; Henry Francis du Pont engaged his assistance\nwith the big new wing of the family's massive Delaware house, Winterthur, now a\nfamed museum of American decorative arts; he designed for Hollywood stars Joan\nCrawford and Fredric March. In May of 1934 he was granted an Honorary Membership\nin the American Institute of Architects.\n\nHenry Davis Sleeper died in Massachusetts General Hospital of leukemia on\nSeptember 22, 1934 and is buried in his family's plot in Mount Auburn Cemetery\nlocated in Watertown and Cambridge, Massachusetts. A. Piatt Andrew wrote the\nmemorial tribute published in the Gloucester Daily Times.\n\nA gay man , some source say that Sleeper was in a\nrelationship with Andrew. Others state that the two were\njust friends\n\nSleeper had never married and left no direct descendants. Beauport passed to his\nbrother Stephen whose real estate income was unequal to Henry's debts. Beauport\nwas sold to Helena Woolworth McCann who was contacted by Henry Francis Du Pont\nurging that Sleeper's rooms remain exactly as they were as the value of the\nhouse and its collection of art objects depended primarily on their being left\nunchanged. Mrs McCann preserved the house as it was; at her death, the house was\ninherited by her daughters from whose hands it passed into the care of Historic\nNew England in 1942.\n\nHenry Davis Sleeper was sufficiently prominent that Beauport, Sleeper-McCann\nHouse, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2003. |date=2001-08-\n31 |author=Timothy T.
