{"cursor":"31960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Human nature' refers to the distinguishing characteristics, including ways of\nthinking, feeling and acting, that humans tend to have naturally, i.e.\nindependently of the influence of culture. The questions of what these\ncharacteristics are, what causes them, and how fixed human nature is, are\namongst the oldest and most important questions in western philosophy. These\nquestions have particularly important implications in ethics, politics, and\ntheology. This is partly because human nature can be regarded as both a source\nof norms of conduct or ways of life, as well as presenting obstacles or\nconstraints on living a good life. The complex implications of such questions\nare also dealt with in art and literature, while the multiple branches of the\nHumanities together form an important domain of inquiry into human nature, and\nthe question of what it means to be human.\n\nThe branches of contemporary science associated with the study of human nature\ninclude anthropology, sociology, sociobiology, and psychology, particularly\nevolutionary psychology, and developmental psychology. The \"nature versus\nnurture\" debate is a broadly inclusive and well-known instance of a discussion\nabout human nature in the natural sciences.\n","linknr":446,"url":"Human_nature","recorded":1362485238,"links":43,"instances":["aristotle","psychology","publisher","philosophy","philosophy","sociology","philosopher","anthropologist","philosophy","anatomy","behavior"],"pdf":["http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/humemora.pdf"],"categories":["Humans","Philosophical anthropology","Evolutionary psychology","Personal life","Human behavior"],"headings":["History","Psychology and biology","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["agency","philosophy"],["nature","philosophy"],["politics","aristotle"],["politics","aristotle"],["francis_hutcheson","philosopher"],["limb","anatomy"],["donald_brown","anthropologist"],["impulse","psychology"],["cynicism","philosophy"],["norm","philosophy"],["norm","sociology"],["normality","behavior"],["polity","publisher"]],"members":["politics","impulse","polity","cynicism","nature","norm","francis_hutcheson","donald_brown","agency","limb","normality"],"related":["Thinking","Feeling","Agency_(philosophy)","Humans","Nature_(philosophy)","Culture","Western_philosophy","Ethics","Politics","Theology","Art","Literature","Humanities","Anthropology","Sociology","Sociobiology","Psychology","Evolutionary_psychology","Developmental_psychology","Nature_versus_nurture","Natural_science","Socrates","Teleological","Final_cause","Formal_cause","Causality","Theory_of_Forms","Divinity","Jean-Jacques_Rousseau","Hegel","Marx's_theory_of_human_nature","Kierkegaard","Nietzsche","Sartre","Structuralists","Postmodernists","Behaviorism","Determinism","Psychiatry","Philosophy","Classical_Greece","Socrates","Plato","Xenophon","Aristotle","Rationalist","Middle_Ages","Islamic_philosophy","Christian_philosophy","Jewish_philosophy","Soul","Nicomachean_Ethics","Politics_(Aristotle)","Division_of_labor","Reason","Politics_(Aristotle)","Mimetic","Teleological","Modern_history","Four_causes","Formal_cause","Final_cause","Machiavelli","Francis_Bacon","René_Descartes","Science","Pre-Socratic","Thomas_Hobbes","Giambattista_Vico","David_Hume","John_Locke","Empiricism","Jean_Jacques_Rousseau","French_Revolution","Charles_Darwin","Sigmund_Freud","Western_culture","Noble_savage","Kant","Hegel","Marx","German_Idealism","Historicism","Romanticism","Francis_Hutcheson_(philosopher)","Anthony_Ashley-Cooper,_3rd_Earl_of_Shaftesbury","Francis_Bacon","Metaphysics","United_States","Charles_Darwin","Sigmund_Freud","Psychoanalysis","Id,_ego,_and_super-ego","Edward_Osborne_Wilson","Sociobiology","Evolutionary_psychology","Edward_O._Wilson","Art","Westermarck_effect","Reductionism","Anthropologist","David_E._Jones","Dragons","Dinosaur","Ethology","Penetrance","Evolutionary_psychology","Mind","Adaptations","Essentialist","Norms_of_reaction","MIT_Press","Face","Ovulation","Menstrual_cycle","Handedness","Scissor","Limb_(anatomy)","Left-handedness","Recessive_trait","Acculturate","Donald_Brown_(anthropologist)","Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington","Habituation","William_James","Flywheel","Society","John_Locke","Nayef_Al-Rodhan","Impulse_(psychology)","Suicide","Instinct","Aggressionism","Common_sense","Cynicism_(philosophy)","Diathesis-stress_model","Differential_susceptibility_hypothesis","Defence_mechanism","Enneagram_of_Personality","Human_condition","Humanism","Nature","Norm_(philosophy)","Norm_(sociology)","Normality_(behavior)","Newcastle_University","Steven_Pinker","McGraw-Hill","Larry_Arnhart","State_University_of_New_York_Press","Allen_Lane","Macmillan_Publishers","Rutgers_University_Press","Noam_Chomsky","Pluto_Press","Michel_Foucault","New_Press","Robert_Denoon_Cumming","Chicago_University_Press","Merle_Curti","University_of_Wisconsin_Press","James_Chowning_Davies","John_Wiley_and_Sons","Frances_Pinter","Sigmund_Freud","W._W._Norton_&_Company","Hogarth_Press","Norman_Geras","Jürgen_Habermas","Polity_(publisher)","P._M._S._Hacker","Blackwell_Publishing","Princeton_University_Press","David_Hume","Oxford_University_Press","Sussex_Academic_Press","Reinhold_Niebuhr","Zaid_Orudzhev","Basil_Blackwell","Steven_Pinker","Louis_Pojman","Stephen_Peter_Rosen","University_of_Minnesota_Press","Routledge","Palgrave_Macmillan","St._Martin's_Press","Roberto_Mangabeira_Unger","Johnjoe_McFadden","Continuum_International_Publishing_Group","Edmund_O._Wilson"]}
