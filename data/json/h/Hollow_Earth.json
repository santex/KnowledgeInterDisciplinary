{"cursor":"34118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"::This article is about the Hollow Earth concept. For the novel by John and\n:Carole Barrowman, see [[Hollow Earth (novel)]]\nThe 'Hollow Earth' hypothesis proposes that the planet Earth is either entirely\nhollow or otherwise contains a substantial interior space. The hypothesis has\nbeen shown to be wrong by observational evidence, as well as by the modern\nunderstanding of planet formation; the scientific community has dismissed the\nnotion since at least the late 18th century.\n\nThe concept of a hollow Earth still recurs in folklore and as the premise for\nsubterranean fiction, a subgenre of adventure fiction. It is also featured in\nsome present-day pseudoscientific and conspiracy theories.\n","linknr":538,"url":"Hollow_Earth","recorded":1362568577,"links":45,"instances":["mississippi_river","town","elementary_mathematics","novel","disambiguation","pioneer"],"pdf":["http://www.maa.org/editorial/euler/How%20Euler%20Did%20It%2042%20Hollow%20earth.pdf","http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/dgriffin/Research/Griffin-HE_in_Science.pdf"],"categories":["Obsolete
