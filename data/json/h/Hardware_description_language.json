{"cursor":"27622","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n}} In electronics, a 'hardware description language' or 'HDL' is a specialized\ncomputer language used to describe the structure, design and operation of\nelectronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits.\n\nA hardware description language enables a precise, formal description of an\nelectronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis, simulation, and\nsimulated testing of an electronic circuit. It also allows for the compilation\nof an HDL program into a lower level specification of physical electronic\ncomponents, such as the set of masks used to create an integrated circuit.\n\nA hardware description language looks much like a programming language such as\nC; it is a textual description consisting of expressions, statements and control\nstructures. One important difference between most programming languages and HDLs\nis that HDLs explicitly include the notion of time.\n\nHDLs form an integral part of Electronic design automation systems, especially\nfor complex circuits, such as microprocessors.\n","linknr":361,"url":"Hardware_description_language","recorded":1362668278,"links":35,"instances":["programming_language","programming_language","hdl","programming_language","hardware_description_language","hdl","haskell","programming_language","computer_science","hdl","programming_language","hardware_description_language","programming_language","programming_language","pli"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hardware
