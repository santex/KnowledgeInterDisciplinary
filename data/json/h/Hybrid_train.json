{"cursor":"12386","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'hybrid train' is a locomotive, railcar or train that uses an onboard\nrechargeable energy storage system (RESS), placed between the power source\n(often a diesel engine prime mover) and the traction transmission system\nconnected to the wheels. Since most diesel locomotives are diesel-electric, they\nhave all the components of a series hybrid transmission except the storage\nbattery, making this a relatively simple prospect.\n\nSurplus energy from the power source, or energy derived from regenerative\nbraking, charges the storage system. During acceleration, stored energy is\ndirected to the transmission system, boosting that available from the main power\nsource. In existing designs, the storage system can be electric traction\nbatteries, or a flywheel. The energy source is diesel, liquified petroleum gas,\nor hydrogen (for fuel cells) and transmission is direct mechanical, electric or\nhydrostatic.\n\nDiesel electric locomotives have high potential for energy savings when using\ndynamic braking, which use the traction motors as generators to stop the train.\nWithout a way to recover and store the braking energy, these engines currently\nhave no option other than to transfer it into the atmosphere as heat, using\nlarge electric heating elements and high velocity cooling fans.\n\nUsing a storage system means that a non-fully electric train can use dynamic\nbraking, and even shut down the main power source whilst idling or stationary.\nReducing energy consumption provides environmental benefits and economic\nsavings. A smaller scale version of the concept is found in hybrid\nautomobiles, such as the Toyota Prius.\n","linknr":323,"url":"Hybrid_train","recorded":1362543213,"links":21,"instances":["electricity","los_angeles","railcar","hst","mechanics","locomotive"],"pdf":["http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/development/tech/pdf_4/Tech-no.4-62-70.pdf","http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/development/tech/pdf_4/Tech-no.4-62-70.pdf","http://www.jrfreight.co.jp/common/pdf/news/201002-02.pdf"],"categories":["Hybrid locomotives|*"],"headings":["Development","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/JRE-Kiha-E200-1-Yachiho-2.jpg/240px-JRE-Kiha-E200-1-Yachiho-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/HD300-901_Shin-Akitsu_20100330.JPG/240px-HD300-901_Shin-Akitsu_20100330.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/RailPower_Green_Goat.jpg/250px-RailPower_Green_Goat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["prime_mover","locomotive"],["transmission","mechanics"],["nzr_rm_class","railcar"],["british_rail_class_43","hst"],["union_station","los_angeles"],["battery","electricity"]],"members":["battery","union_station","nzr_rm_class","british_rail_class_43","transmission","prime_mover"],"related":["Locomotive","Railcar","Train","Rechargeable_energy_storage_system","Diesel_engine","Prime_mover_(locomotive)","Regenerative_braking","Traction_battery","Flywheel_energy_storage","Diesel_fuel","Liquified_petroleum_gas","Hydrogen_economy","Fuel_cell","Transmission_(mechanics)","Diesel-electric_transmission","Hydraulic_drive_system","Diesel_electric_locomotive","Dynamic_braking","Toyota_Prius","Pieper","Vicinal_tramway","Compagnie_des_Chemins_de_Fer_de_Grande_Banlieue","J._G._Parry-Thomas","Hybrid_Synergy_Drive","United_Kingdom","New-Zealand","NZR_RM_class_(railcar)","Czechoslovakia","ČKD","Electric_motor","Railway_test_circuit_Velim","Socialist_economics","JR_East","Hydrogen","Lithium-ion_battery","Regenerative_braking","KiHa_E200","JR_Freight_Class_HD300","Toshiba","Fuchū,_Tokyo","Lithium-ion_battery","JNR_Class_DE10","Sinara_transport_machines","Switcher","Lithium-ion_batteries","Electric_double-layer_capacitor","Alternating_current","London_Underground_battery-electric_locomotives","Third_rail","Stourbridge_Town_Branch_Line","Parry_People_Movers","British_Rail_Class_139","British_Rail_Class_43_(HST)","Great_Central_Railway","New_Measurement_Train","Intercity_Express_Programme","Overhead_line","Railpower_Technologies","Union_Pacific","Canadian_Pacific","General_Electric","Union_Station_(Los_Angeles)","Regenerative_braking","Battery_(electricity)","Fuel_saving_devices","Emissions_standard","GE_Evolution_Series","Savannah,_Georgia","W_class_Melbourne_tram","Biodiesel","River_Street_Streetcar","Savannah,_Georgia","Electro-diesel_locomotive","Hybrid_vehicle","Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain","List_of_hybrid_vehicles","Railpower_Technologies","Renewable_energy"]}
