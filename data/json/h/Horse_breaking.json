Horses are trained to be\nmanageable by humans for everyday care as well as for equestrian activities from\nhorse racing to therapeutic horseback riding for people with disabilities.\n\nHistorically, horses were trained for warfare, farm work, sport and transport.\nToday, most horse training is geared toward making horses useful for a variety\nof recreational and sporting equestrian pursuits. Horses are also trained for\nspecialized jobs from movie stunt work to police and crowd control activities,\ncircus entertainment, and equine-assisted psychotherapy.\n\nThere is tremendous controversy over various methods of horse training and even\nsome of the words used to describe these methods. Some techniques are considered\ncruel, other methods are considered gentler and more humane.
