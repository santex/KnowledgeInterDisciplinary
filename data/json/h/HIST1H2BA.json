Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around\n| a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A,\n| H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the\n| interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to\n| form higher order chromatin structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a\n| testis/sperm-specific member of the histone H2B family. Transcripts from this\n| gene contain a palindromic termination element.\n}}\n","linknr":213,"url":"HIST1H2BA","recorded":1362481048,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/PBB_Protein_HIST1H2BA_image.jpg/250px-PBB_Protein_HIST1H2BA_image.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Blanksvg.svg/180px-Blanksvg.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene"]}
