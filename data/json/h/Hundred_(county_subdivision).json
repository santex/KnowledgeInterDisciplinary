{"cursor":"21126","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'hundred' is a geographic division formerly used in England, Wales, South\nAustralia and some parts of the United States, to divide a larger region into\nsmaller administrative divisions; similar divisions were made in Denmark,\nGermany (Southern Schleswig), Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Norway. Other terms\nfor the hundred in English and other languages include\n'[[#wapentake|wapentake]]', 'herred' (Danish, Norwegian BokmÃ¥l), 'herad'\n(Norwegian Nynorsk), 'hÃ©raÃ°' (Icelandic), 'hÃ¤rad' or 'hundare' (Swedish),\n'Harde' (German), 'kihlakunta' (Finnish) and 'kihelkond' (Estonian). In Ireland\nthe similar subdivision of counties was referred to as baronies. The term has\nfallen into general disuse, except for legal documentation. The name \"hundred\"\nis derived from the number one hundred; it may once have referred to an area\nliable to provide for a hundred men under arms, or containing roughly a hundred\nhomesteads. It was a traditional Germanic system described as early as AD 98 by\nTacitus (the centeni). Similar systems were used in the traditional\nadministrative regimes of China and Japan.\n","linknr":571,"url":"Hundred_(county_subdivision)","recorded":1362576359,"links":33,"instances":["county_subdivision","county_subdivision","politics","division","england","damages_act_1886","administrative_division","office","great_britain_and_ireland","assembly"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of country subdivisions","Anglo-Norse England","Hundreds (country subdivision)|","Scandinavian history","Former subdivisions of England"],"headings":["England and Wales","Scandinavia","United States","Australia","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Kernow_Hundreds.png/250px-Kernow_Hundreds.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Administrative_division_of_denmark_in_medieval_times.jpg/200px-Administrative_division_of_denmark_in_medieval_times.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["parish","administrative_division"],["parish","administrative_division"],["reeve","england"],["steward","office"],["riot","damages_act_1886"],["urban_district","great_britain_and_ireland"],["thing","assembly"],["riding","division"],["ward","politics"],["lathe","county_subdivision"],["rape","county_subdivision"]],"members":["lathe","rape","ward","riding","reeve","riot","parish","steward","urban_district","thing"],"related":["England","Wales","South_Australia","United_States","Administrative_division","Denmark","Germany","Southern_Schleswig","Sweden","Finland","Estonia","Norway","Danish_language","Norwegian_Bokmål","Norwegian_Nynorsk","Swedish_language","German_language","Finnish_language","Estonian_language","Ireland","Baronies","Germanic_tribes","Tacitus","China","Japan","County","England_and_Wales","Royal_Manor","Tithings","Parish_(administrative_division)","England","Wales","Common_law","Districts_of_England","Local_Government_Act_1894","Parish_(administrative_division)","County","Saxons","Edgar_the_Peaceful","Shire","Reeve_(England)","Sheriff","Leicestershire","Devon","Frankpledge","Freeholder","Manorialism","Court_baron","Court_leet","Tithing","Tourn","Steward_(office)","Lord_of_the_Manor","County_court","Riot","Riot_(Damages)_Act_1886","County_constituency","Petty_sessions","Poor_law_union","Sanitary_district","Highway_district","Urban_district_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)","Rural_district","Districts_of_England","Chiltern_Hundreds","Legal_fiction","List_of_Stewards_of_the_Chiltern_Hundreds","Resignation_from_the_House_of_Commons","East_Riding_of_Yorkshire","Old_Norse","Anglo-Saxons","Folk_etymology","Weapon","Tacitus","Switzerland","Appenzell_Innerrhoden","Thing_(assembly)","Danelaw","Yorkshire","Derbyshire","Leicestershire","Northamptonshire","Nottinghamshire","Rutland","Lincolnshire","Riding_(division)","Domesday_Book","Lincolnshire","Beltisloe","Loveden","Danish_people","Ward_(politics)","Cumberland","County_Durham","Northumberland","Westmorland","Lathe_(county_subdivision)","Kent","Rape_(county_subdivision)","Sussex","Barony","Svealand","Finland","Proto-Norse","Proto-Germanic","Norrland","Riksdag_of_the_Estates","Tingsrätt","Satakunta","Northern_Crusades","Christianization","Municipalities_of_Finland","Delaware","New_Jersey","Pennsylvania","List_of_Delaware_Counties_and_Hundreds","Constituency","Maryland","Carroll_County,_Maryland","Baltimore_County,_Maryland","Frederick_County,_Maryland","Virginia","Martin's_Hundred","Flowerdew_Hundred_Plantation","Bermuda_Hundred","Land_Ordinance_of_1785","Thomas_Jefferson","Survey_township","Public_Land_Survey_System","Cadastral_divisions_of_South_Australia","Cumberland_County,_New_South_Wales","Sydney","Attundaland","Cantref","Chiltern_Hundreds","Feudal_measurement","Fjärdhundraland","Henry_de_Bracton","Hundred_Rolls","Leidang","List_of_hundreds_of_England_and_Wales","List_of_hundreds_of_Sweden","Moot_hall","Roslagen","Tiundaland"]}
