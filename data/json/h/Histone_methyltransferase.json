The attachment of methyl groups occurs\npredominantly at specific lysine or arginine residues on histones H3 and H4. Two major types of histone methyltranferases\nexist, lysine-specific (which can be SET ('S'u(var)3-9, 'E'nhancer of Zeste,\n'T'rithorax) domain containing or non-SET domain containing) and arginine-\nspecific. In\nboth types of histone methyltransferases, cofactor S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM)\nserves as a cofactor and methyl donor group.  In eukaryotic\ncells, the genome is tightly condensed into chromatin (composed of DNA and\nhistone proteins ), so enzymes, such as histone methyltransferases,\nmust overcome this inaccessibility. Histone\nmethyltransferase does so by modifying histones at certain sites through\nmethylation. Methylation of histones is important biologically because it is the\nprincipal epigenetic modification of chromatin that determines gene expression,\ngenomic stability, stem cell maturation, cell lineage development, genetic\nimprinting, DNA methylation, and cell mitosis. \n","linknr":555,"url":"Histone_methyltransferase","recorded":1362481208,"links":21,"instances":["biochemistry","gene"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 2.1.1","Epigenetics"],"headings":["Types","Role in gene regulation","Disease relevance","Further research","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Histone_Methyltransferase%2C_front_view.tiff/lossless-page1-220px-Histone_Methyltransferase%2C_front_view.tiff.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Histone_Methyltransferase%2C_back_view.tiff/lossless-page1-220px-Histone_Methyltransferase%2C_back_view.tiff.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Histone_Methyltransferase%2C_SAM_and_Lysine_residue.tiff/lossless-page1-220px-Histone_Methyltransferase%2C_SAM_and_Lysine_residue.tiff.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["set","gene"]],"members":["cofactor","set"],"related":["Enzyme","EZH2","Catalyze","Methyl","Lysine","Arginine","Histone","Protein","Protein_domain","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","S-Adenosyl_methionine","Chromatin","DNA","Histone","Methylation","ASH1L","DOT1L","EHMT1","EHMT2","EZH1","EZH2","Myeloid/lymphoid_or_mixed-lineage_leukemia","MLL2","MLL3","MLL4","MLL5","NSD1","PRDM2","SET_(gene)","SETBP1","SETD1A","SETD1B","SETD2","SETD3","SETD4","SETD5","SETD6","SETD7","SETD8","SETD9","SETDB1","SETDB2","SETMAR","SMYD1","SMYD2","SMYD3","SMYD4","SMYD5","SUV39H1","SUV39H2","SUV420H1","SUV420H2","S-Adenosyl_methionine","Histone_methylation","Epigenetic","Gene_regulation","Histone-Modifying_Enzymes","Histone_acetyltransferase","Histone_deacetylase","RNA_polymerase_control_by_chromatin_structure","Histone_methylation"]}
