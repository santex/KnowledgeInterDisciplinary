This type of heterogamy occurs for example in\nsome aphids. *In reproductive biology, 'heterogamy' or 'heterogamous' is often\nused as a synonym of heterogametic, meaning the presence of two unlike\nchromosomes in a sex. {{Cite journal| doi =\n10.1098/rspb.2004.2769| issn = 0962-8452| volume = 271\n| issue = 1549| pages = 1751â1755| last = Hiroki| first = Masato| coauthors =\n| Yohsuke Tagami, Kazuki Miura, Yoshiomi Kato| title = Multiple infection with\n| Wolbachia inducing different reproductive manipulations in the butterfly\n| Eurema hecabe.| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological\n| Sciences| date = 2004-08-22}}.

For example, ethnic\nheterogamy refers to marriages involving individuals of different ethnic groups.\nAge heterogamy refers to marriages involving partners of significantly different\nages. Heterogamy and homogamy are also used to describe marriage or union\nbetween people of unlike and like sex (or gender) respectively.\n\nThe terms heterogametic and homogametic are related to heterogamy, but distinct.\n","linknr":106,"url":"Heterogamous","recorded":1362676051,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant reproduction","Genetics","Marriage"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Parthenogenesis","Sexual_reproduction","Aphid","Heterogametic","Anisogamy","Gamete","Stamen","Carpel","Sociology","Marriage","Endogamy","Heterogametic"]}
