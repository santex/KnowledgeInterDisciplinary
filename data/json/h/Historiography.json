{"cursor":"48047","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Historiography' refers either to the study of the methodology and development\nof \"history\" (as a discipline), or to a body of historical work on a specialized\ntopic. Scholars discuss historiography topically â such as the\n\"historiography of Catholicism\", the \"historiography of early Islam\", or the\n\"historiography of China\" â as well as specific approaches and genres, such\nas political history and social history. Beginning in the nineteenth century,\nwith the ascent of academic history, a corpus of historiographic literature\ndeveloped.\n\nThe research interests of historians change over time, and in recent decades\nthere has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic, economic and political\nhistory toward newer approaches, especially social and cultural studies. From\n1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities\nidentifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of\npolitical historians fell from 40% to 30%. Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%,\neconomic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based\non full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H.

Historiographer therefore\nmeant \"historian\", and it is in this sense that certain official historians were\ngiven the title \"Historiographer Royal\", in Sweden (from 1618), England (from\n1660), and Scotland (from 1681).

existence.\n","linknr":697,"url":"Historiography","recorded":1362373360,"links":67,"instances":["xenophon","england","historiography","discipline","medieval_writer"],"pdf":["http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/causal.pdf","http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/causal.pdf"],"categories":["Articles
