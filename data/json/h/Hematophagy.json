Since blood is a fluid tissue rich in nutritious\nproteins and lipids that can be taken without enormous effort, hematophagy has\nevolved as a preferred form of feeding in many small animals such as worms and\narthropods. Some intestinal nematodes, such as Ancylostomids, feed on blood\nextracted from the capillaries of the gut and about 75% of all species of\nleeches (e.g. Hirudo medicinalis), a free-living worm, are hematophagous. Some\nfish, such as lampreys, and mammals, especially the vampire bats, and birds,\nsuch as the vampire finches and oxpeckers, also practice hematophagy.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Hematophagy","recorded":1362572754,"links":36,"instances":["medicine","culture","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Haematophagy|"],"headings":["Mechanism and evolution","Medical importance","Human hematophagy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Anopheles_stephensi.jpeg/250px-Anopheles_stephensi.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Cimex_lectularius.jpg/220px-Cimex_lectularius.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Blood_feeding_butterflies_5362.JPG/220px-Blood_feeding_butterflies_5362.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Starling_Feeding_Offspring.jpg/160px-Starling_Feeding_Offspring.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["moche","culture"],["transmission","medicine"]],"members":["transmission","moche","host"],"related":["Animal","Feeding","Blood","Greek_language","Protein","Lipid","Evolution","Worm","Arthropod","Parasitic_worm","Leech","Fish","Lamprey","Mammal","Vampire_bat","Vampire_finch","Oxpeckers","Mouth","Skin","Host_(biology)","Bird","Fish","Proboscis","Capillary","Incisor","Hemostasis","Vasoconstriction","Inflammation","Pain","Saliva","Anesthesia","Anticoagulant","Hirudin","Assassin_bug","Mosquito","Pollen","Fruit","Ovum","Annelid","Nematode","Diptera","Wing","Fly","Moth","Biological_adaptation","Nocturnal","Sweat","Carbon_dioxide","Heat","Light","Bacteria","Viruses","Parasite","Infectious_disease","Bubonic_plague","Chagas_disease","Dengue_fever","Filariasis","Leishmaniasis","Lyme_disease","Malaria","Rabies","African_trypanosomiasis","St._Louis_encephalitis","Tularemia","Typhus","Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever","West_Nile_fever","Sandfly","Blackfly","Tsetse_fly","Bedbug","Assassin_bug","Mosquito","Tick","Louse","Mite","Midge","Flea","Hirudotherapy","Saliva","Desmoteplase","Stroke","Milk","Maasai_people","Mongols","Black_pudding","Moche_(culture)","Scythia","Russia","War","Transubstantiation","Jesus_Christ","Christian","Eucharist","Vampire","Chupacabras","Consumer-resource_systems","Natural_reservoir","Tick-borne_disease","Transmission_(medicine)","Zoonosis"]}
