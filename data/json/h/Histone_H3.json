Featuring a main globular domain and a\nlong N-terminal tail, H3 is involved with the structure of the nucleosomes of\nthe 'beads on a string' structure. Histone proteins are highly post-\ntranslationally modified however Histone H3 is the most extensively modified of\nthe five histones. The term \"Histone H3\" alone is purposely ambiguous in that it\ndoes not distinguish between sequence variants or modification state. Histone H3\nis an important protein in the emerging field of epigenetics, where its sequence\nvariants and variable modification states are thought to play a role in the\ndynamic and long term regulation of genes.\n","linknr":250,"url":"Histone_H3","recorded":1362481072,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["Epigenetics and Post-Translational Modifications","Sequence Variants","Genetics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Histone","Protein","Chromatin","Eukaryotic_cell","N-terminal_end","Nucleosome","Epigenetics","Nucleosome","Lysine","Arginine","Serine","Threonine","Gene_silencing","Heterochromatin","Histone_acetyltransferase","RNA","HIST1H3A","HIST1H3B","HIST1H3C","HIST1H3D","HIST1H3E","HIST1H3F","HIST1H3G","HIST1H3H","HIST1H3I","HIST1H3J","HIST2H3A","HIST2H3C","HIST2H3D","H3F3A","H3F3B","Histone","Proteins","Histone_H1","Histone_H2A","Histone_H2B","Histone_H4","Nucleosome","Histone","Chromatin"]}
