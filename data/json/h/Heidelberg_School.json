The movement has latterly been described as\n'Australian Impressionism.'\n\nThe term was coined in July 1891 by local art critic Sidney Dickenson, reviewing\nthe works of Melbourne-based artists Arthur Streeton and Walter Withers.\nDickenson noted that these artists, whose works were mostly painted in the\nHeidelberg area, could be considered as \"The Heidelberg School\". Since that\ntime, The Heidelberg School has taken on a wider meaning and covers Australian\nartists of the late nineteenth century who painted plein-air in the\nimpressionist tradition. These artists were inspired by the beautiful landscapes\nof the Yarra and the unique light that typifies the Australian bush.\n\nThe works of these artists are notable, not only for their merits as\ncompositions, but as part of Australia's historical record. The period\nimmediately before Federation is the setting for many classic Australian stories\nof the \"bush\", both fact and fiction. The School's work provides a visual\ncomplement to these tales and their images have embedded themselves into\nAustralia's historical subconscious. Many of the artworks can be seen in\nAustralian galleries, notably the National Gallery of Victoria, the National\nGallery of Australia and the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Heidelberg_School","recorded":1372152268,"links":[],"instances":["historian","art_historian","actor","australian_actor","cinematographer","critic","artist","journalist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arts in Australia","Art movements","Impressionism","Melbourne culture","Victorian era"],"headings":["History","Influences and style","Associated artists","Locations","Legacy","Gallery","See also","References","Further reading","External resources"],"image":[],"tags":[["james_smith","journalist"],["william_moore","critic"],["david_davies","artist"],["terry_smith","art_historian"],["ian_baker","cinematographer"],["henry_reynolds","historian"],["john_wood","australian_actor"],["john_lee","actor"]],"members":["henry_reynolds","terry_smith","john_lee","john_wood","ian_baker","william_moore","david_davies","james_smith"],"related":["Art_movement","Melbourne","Arthur_Streeton","Walter_Withers","Heidelberg,_Victoria","Plein-air","Impressionist","Yarra_River","Australian_bush","Federation_of_Australia","National_Gallery_of_Victoria","National_Gallery_of_Australia","Ballarat_Fine_Art_Gallery","Heidelberg,_Victoria","Melbourne","Arthur_Streeton","Walter_Withers","Tom_Roberts","Frederick_McCubbin","Charles_Conder","9_by_5_Impression_Exhibition","Swanston_Street","Melbourne_Town_Hall","Charles_Douglas_Richardson","Avant_garde","James_Smith_(journalist)","William_Moore_(critic)","Angus_&_Robertson","Impressionist","Plein_air","The_bush","Alice_Boyd","Louis_Buvelot","Charles_Conder","David_Davies_(artist)","Emanuel_Phillips_Fox","Ethel_Carrick","Eugene_Von_Guerard","Frederick_McCubbin","Jane_Price","Charles_Douglas_Richardson","Tom_Roberts","John_Thomas_Nightingale_Rowell","William_Nicholas_Rowell","Arthur_Streeton","Clara_Southern","Jane_Sutherland","Tudor_St_George_Tucker","May_Vale","Walter_Withers","George_Folingsby","Heidelberg,_Victoria","Bulleen,_Victoria","Templestowe,_Victoria","Warrandyte","Eltham,_Victoria","Research,_Victoria","Diamond_Creek,_Victoria","Ferntree_Gully,_Victoria","Kallista,_Victoria","Olinda,_Victoria","Mount_Dandenong,_Victoria","Kalorama,_Victoria","Silvan,_Victoria","Lilydale,_Victoria","Yarra_Glen,_Victoria","Coldstream,_Victoria","Yering,_Victoria","Ian_Burn","Ian_Burn","Terry_Smith_(art_historian)","Oxford_University_Press","Australian_citizenship_test","John_Howard","Period_film","Australian_New_Wave","Canberra","Peter_Weir","Continuum_International_Publishing_Group","Sheep_station","Ian_Baker_(cinematographer)","Henry_Reynolds_(historian)","Currency_Press","Docudrama","Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation","John_Wood_(Australian_actor)","Michele_Fawdon","John_Lee_(actor)","Joan_Sydney","Nina_Landis","Louis_Buvelot","Julian_Ashton","John_Longstaff","Visual_arts_of_Australia","Impressionism","9_by_5_Impression_Exhibition","Box_Hill_artists'_camp","Charterisville"]}
