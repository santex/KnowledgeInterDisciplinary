Before the 1871 Unification of\nGermany, Hamburg was a fully sovereign state of its own. Prior to the\nconstitutional changes in 1919, the stringent civic republic was ruled by a\nclass of hereditary grand burghers or Hanseaten.\n\nHamburg is a major transport hub in Northern Germany and is one of the most\naffluent cities in Europe. It has become a media and industrial centre, with\nplants and facilities belonging to [[Airbus]], [[Blohm + Voss]] and [[Aurubis]].\nThe radio and television broadcaster [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] and publishers\nsuch as [[Gruner + Jahr]] and [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]-Verlag are pillars of the\nimportant media industry in Hamburg. Hamburg has been an important financial\ncentre for centuries, and is the seat of the world's second oldest bank,\nBerenberg Bank. In total, there are more than 120,000 enterprises.\n\nThe city is a major tourist destination for both domestic and overseas visitors;\nHamburg ranked 17th in the world for livability in 2012,<ref></ref> and, in\n2010, the city ranked 10th in the world.\n","title":"hamburg","headings":["Geography","History","Demographics","Government","Cityscape","Culture and contemporary
