It includes minor conditions such as heat cramps,\nheat syncope, and heat exhaustion as well as the more severe condition known as\nheat stroke. 'Heat stroke' is defined as a body temperature of\ngreater than due to environmental heat exposure with lack of thermoregulation.\nThis is distinct from a fever, where there is a physiological increase in the\ntemperature set point of the body.\n\nTreatment involves rapid physical cooling.\n","linknr":309,"url":"Heat_exhaustion","recorded":1362373481,"links":23,"instances":["medical_sign"],"pdf":["http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3154.pdf"],"categories":["Emergency medicine","Effects of external causes"],"headings":["Classification","Sign and symptoms","Causes","Prevention","Treatment","Prognosis","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tetany","medical_sign"]],"members":["tetany"],"related":["Heat_cramps","Heat_syncope","Exhaustion","Body_temperature","Thermoregulation","Fever","Physiological","Homeostasis","Thermoregulation","Exhaustion","Edema","Heat_cramps","Rash","Tetany_(medical_sign)","Hyperthermia","Alcohol","Caffeine","Stimulants","Medications","Car_window","Stuffed_toy","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Guide_dogs","Leash","Caregiver","Syndrome","Medical_condition","Newspaper","Magazine","Blog","Popular_media","Arthur_Guyton","Urine","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Air-conditioning","Torso","Groin","Air_conditioning","Vasoconstriction","Shivering","Hypothermia","Cold_shock_response","Dantrolene","Serotonin_syndrome","Malignant_hyperthermia","2,4-dinitrophenol","Sports_drink","Electrolyte","Water_intoxication","Hyponatremia","Hypertonic","CPR","Cardiac_arrest"]}
