{"cursor":"3647","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Hairy root culture', also called 'transformed root culture', is a type of plant\ntissue culture that is used to study plant metabolic processes or to produce\nvaluable secondary metabolites, often with plant genetic engineering.\n\nA naturally occurring soil bacterium [[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]] that contains\n'root inducing plasmids' (also called Ri plasmids) can infect plant roots and\ncause them to produce a food source for the bacterium, opines, and to grow\nabnormally. The abnormal roots are particularly easy to\nculture in artificial media because hormones are not needed,\nand they are neoplastic, with indefinite growth. The neoplastic roots produced\nby A. rhizogenes infection have a high growth rate (compared to untransformed\nadventitious roots), as well as genetic and biochemical stability.\n\nCurrently the main constraint for commercial utilization of hairy root culture\nis the development and up-scaling of appropriate (bioreactors) vessels for the\ndelicate and sensitive hairy roots. \n\nSo far, the only company based on Hairy root Cultures as an industrial level is\na Swiss company called ROOTec bioactives AG in Witterswil (SO).\n","linknr":127,"url":"Hairy_root_culture","recorded":1362500516,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell culture","Plant physiology"],"headings":["Metabolic studies","Genetically transformed cultures","Use in plant propagation","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Plant_tissue_culture","Secondary_metabolites","Genetic_engineering","Opines","Neoplasm","Bioreactors","Phytoremediation","Genetic_engineering","Transfer_DNA","Plant_embryogenesis"]}
