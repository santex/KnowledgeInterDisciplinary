{"cursor":"1592","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In differential geometry, a 'Hodge cycle' or 'Hodge class' is a particular kind\nof homology class defined on a complex algebraic variety V, or more generally on\na KÃ¤hler manifold. A homology class x in a homology group\n\n:H k(V, C) = H\n\nwhere V is a non-singular complex algebraic variety or KÃ¤hler manifold is a\n'Hodge cycle', provided it satisfies two conditions. Firstly, k is an even\ninteger 2p, and in the direct sum decomposition of H shown to exist in Hodge\ntheory, x is purely of type (p,p). Secondly, x is a rational class, in the sense\nthat it lies in the image of the abelian group homomorphism\n\n:H k(V, Q) → H\n\ndefined in algebraic topology (as a special case of the universal coefficient\ntheorem). The conventional term Hodge cycle therefore is slightly inaccurate, in\nthat x is considered as a class (modulo boundaries); but this is normal usage.\n\nThe importance of Hodge cycles lies primarily in the Hodge conjecture, to the\neffect that Hodge cycles should always be algebraic cycles, for V a complete\nalgebraic variety. This is an unsolved problem, ; it is known that being a Hodge\ncycle is a necessary condition to be an algebraic cycle that is rational, and\nnumerous particular cases of the conjecture are known.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Hodge_cycle","recorded":1362477988,"links":11,"instances":["jargon"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hodge theory"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["modulo","jargon"]],"members":["modulo"],"related":["Differential_geometry","Homology_class","Complex_number","Algebraic_variety","Kähler_manifold","Homology_group","Non-singular","Direct_sum_of_modules","Hodge_theory","Algebraic_topology","Universal_coefficient_theorem","Modulo_(jargon)","Hodge_conjecture","Algebraic_cycle","Complete_algebraic_variety","Necessary_condition"]}
