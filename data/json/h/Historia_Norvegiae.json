{"cursor":"3589","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Historia NorwegiÃ¦' is a short Latin history of Norway written by an anonymous\nmonk. The only extant manuscript, in the private possession of the Earl of\nDalhousie and kept at Brechin Castle, Scotland, is fragmentary; what we have\nof the Historia is found on folios 1r-12r. The manuscript was once dated to\nthe fifteenth century, but seems now to be from c.1500x1510 (Kunin and\nPhelpstead 2001, x).\n\nThe text itself appears to have been created rather earlier, because it refers\nto a volcanic eruption and earthquake of 1211 as being contemporary.

A short geographical survey of Norway and its dominions, followed by a brief\nhistory of Norway *II. Genealogy of the Earls of Orkney *III. Catalogue of the\nKings of Norway\n\nThe text is important, among other things, because it constitutes (in Latin\ntranslation) an independent version of ÃjÃ³Ã°Ã³lfr of Hvinir's [[Ynglingatal]]\nbesides the text in [[Ynglinga saga]] in the Heimskringla. It also contains some\nunique ethnographic detail, including a description of a shamanic sÃ©ance among\nthe Sami. It is the earliest preserved witness to many of the historical facts\nit treats.\n\nAlong with [[Ãgrip af NÃ³regskonungasÃ¶gum]] and the work of Theodoricus monachus,\nHistoria NorvegiÃ¦ is one of the Norwegian synoptic histories. It is thought to\nhave been the first one written, most probably sometime between 1160 and 1175,\nthough debate about this has been extensive and 1220 would be a more\nconservative terminus. It may have been composed somewhere in eastern Norway.\n\nThe manuscript was published by Peter Andreas Munch in 1850 as SymbolÃ¦ ad\nHistoriam Antiquiorem Rerum Norwegicarum. The standard edition was for many\nyears that of Storm (1880), and the first translation into English that of Kunin\nand Phelpstead (2001). A new critical edition and translation appeared in 2003.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Historia_Norvegiae","recorded":1362900109,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Text%20Series/Historia%26Passio.pdf"],"categories":["12th-century history books","12th-century medieval Latin literature","History of Norway","Kings' sagas","Medieval Latin histories","Norwegian literature"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Latin","Monk","Earl_of_Dalhousie","Brechin_Castle","Þjóðólfr_of_Hvinir","Heimskringla","Shamanism","Sami_people","Theodoric_the_Monk","Peter_Andreas_Munch","Nordisk_familjebok"]}
