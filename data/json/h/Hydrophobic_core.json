The hydrophobic effect explains\nthe separation of a mixture of oil and water into its two components, and the\nbeading of water on nonpolar surfaces such as waxy leaves. At the molecular\nlevel, the hydrophobic effect is important in driving protein\nfolding, formation of lipid bilayers and micelles,\ninsertion of membrane proteins into the nonpolar lipid environment and protein-\nsmall molecule interactions. Substances for which this effect is observed are\nknown as hydrophobes.\n","linknr":218,"url":"Hydrophobic_core","recorded":1362371342,"links":28,"instances":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://facstaff.unca.edu/jschmelt/oilwater.pdf","http://facstaff.unca.edu/jschmelt/oilwater.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical bonding","Supramolecular chemistry","Intermolecular forces"],"headings":["Amphiphiles","Folding of macromolecules","Protein purification","The origin of hydrophobic effect","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Water_drop_on_a_leaf.jpg/250px-Water_drop_on_a_leaf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Liquid_water_hydrogen_bond.png/200px-Liquid_water_hydrogen_bond.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stacking","chemistry"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["stacking","denaturation"],"related":["Nonpolar","Aqueous_solution","Segregation_in_materials","Protein_folding","Lipid_bilayer","Micelle","Membrane_protein","Small_molecule","Hydrophobe","Amphiphiles","Detergent","Micelle","Soap_bubbles","Cell_membranes","Phospholipid","Protein_folding","Amino_acid","Alanine","Valine","Leucine","Isoleucine","Phenylalanine","Tryptophan","Methionine","Side_chains","Chemical_polarity","DNA","Watson-Crick_base_pairing","Stacking_(chemistry)","Biochemistry","Column_chromatography","Phenyl","Sepharose","Elute","Entropy","Hydrogen_bond","Solvation_shell","Entropy","Gibbs_free_energy","Charles_Tanford","Accessible_surface_area","Partition_coefficient","Gibbs_free_energy","Enthalpy","Differential_scanning_calorimetry","Solvation_shell","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Hydrophobe","Hydrophile","Entropic_force","Hydrophobicity_scales"]}
