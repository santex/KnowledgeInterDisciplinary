Believing he is not mentally ill, Crick consults a\nliterature professor (Hoffman) who suspects that Crick might be a character in a\nnovel and who suggests that Crick analyze the narration to determine whether his\nstory might be comedic or tragic.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago, and has been praised for its\ninnovative, intelligent story and fine performances. Ferrell, who came to\nprominence playing brash comedic parts, garnered particular attention for\noffering a restrained performance in his first starring dramatic role.\n","linknr":283,"url":"Harold_Crick","recorded":1362566105,"links":31,"instances":["band","drama"],"pdf":["http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/stranger-than-fiction/notes.pdf"],"categories":["2006 films","American films","English-language films","Columbia Pictures films","American comedy-drama films","American fantasy-comedy films","Films about writers","Films directed by Marc Forster","Films shot in Chicago, Illinois","Metafictional films"],"headings":["Plot","Production","Reception","Awards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/ff/Stranger_Than_Fiction_%282006_movie_poster%29.jpg/220px-Stranger_Than_Fiction_%282006_movie_poster%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["comedy","drama"],["comedy","drama"],["spoon","band"],["(i'd_go_the_whole_wide_world"]],"members":["spoon","comedy"],"related":["Marc_Forster","Zach_Helm","Will_Ferrell","Maggie_Gyllenhaal","Dustin_Hoffman","Queen_Latifah","Emma_Thompson","Brian_Reitzell","Britt_Daniel","Roberto_Schaefer","Matt_Chesse","Mandate_Pictures","Columbia_Pictures","Comedy_film","Drama_film","Fantasy_film","Marc_Forster","Zach_Helm","Will_Ferrell","Maggie_Gyllenhaal","Dustin_Hoffman","Queen_Latifah","Emma_Thompson","IRS","Mentally_ill","Comedy_(drama)","Tragedy","Chicago","Will_Ferrell","Auditor","Internal_Revenue_Service","Tax_resistance","Maggie_Gyllenhaal","Omniscience","Psychiatrist","Linda_Hunt","Schizophrenia","Literature","Dustin_Hoffman","Comedy_(drama)","Tragedy","Bribery","Destiny","Tony_Hale","Emma_Thompson","Writer's_block","Queen_Latifah","Death_&_Taxes","Benjamin_Franklin","Full_stop","Masterpiece","Ulnar_artery","Anthropomorphism","Zach_Helm","Francis_Crick","Blaise_Pascal","Gustave_Eiffel","M._C._Escher","David_Hilbert","Hilbert's_23_problems","Chicago,_Illinois","United_States_of_America","University_of_Illinois_at_Chicago","South_Lawndale","Chicago","Columbia_Pictures","Redd_Kross","Britt_Daniel","Spoon_(band)","Indie_rock","(I'd_Go_The)_Whole_Wide_World","Wreckless_Eric","Rotten_Tomatoes","Metacritic","Roger_Ebert","Sony_Pictures","Gaumont_Film_Company","Roadshow_Films","Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_â€“_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy","Saturn_Award_for_Best_Actor","Saturn_Award_for_Best_Writing","Broadcast_Film_Critics_Association_Award_for_Best_Writer","National_Board_of_Review_Award_for_Best_Original_Screenplay","Saturn_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress","Broadcast_Film_Critics_Association_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress","Saturn_Award_for_Best_Actress","Reality_warping"]}
