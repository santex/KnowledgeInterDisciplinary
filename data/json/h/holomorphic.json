A holomorphic function is a complex-valued function of one or\nmore complex variables that is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of every\npoint in its domain. The existence of a complex derivative in a neighborhood is\na very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is\nactually infinitely differentiable and equal to its own Taylor series.\n\nThe term '[[analytic function]]' is often used interchangeably with “holomorphic\nfunction”, although the word “analytic” is also used in a broader sense to\ndescribe any function (real, complex, or of more general type) that is equal to\nits Taylor series in a neighborhood of each point in its domain. The fact that\nthe class of complex analytic functions coincides with the class of holomorphic\nfunctions is a major theorem in complex analysis.\n\nHolomorphic functions are also sometimes referred to as '[[regular\nfunctions]]'<ref>[http://eom.springer.de/a/a012240.htm Springer Online Reference\nBooks], [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularFunction.html Wolfram\nMathWorld]</ref> or as '[[conformal map]]s'. A holomorphic function whose domain\nis the whole complex plane is called an entire function. The phrase \"holomorphic\nat a point z<sub>0</sub>\" means not just differentiable at z<sub>0</sub>, but\ndifferentiable everywhere within some neighborhood of z<sub>0</sub> in the\ncomplex plane.\n","title":"holomorphic%20function","headings":["Definition","Terminology","Properties","Examples","Several variables","Extension to functional analysis","References","See also"]},"micro-relation":["3: Taylor_series","3: CauchyâRiemann_equations","2: Holomorphic_functions_are_analytic","1: Mathematics","1: Complex_analysis","1: Complex_number","1: Smooth_function","1: Domain_of_a_function","1: Entire_function","1: Limit_of_a_function","1: Derivative#Definition_via_difference_quotients","1: Derivative","1: Linear_transformation","1: Product_rule","1: Quotient_rule","1: Chain_rule","1: Wirtinger_derivative","1: LoomanâMenchoff_theorem","1: Cauchy","1: Charles_Auguste_Briot","1: Cauchy-Riemann_equations","1: Partial_differential_equation","1: Laplace's_equation","1: Harmonic_function","1: Harmonic_conjugate","1: Cauchy's_integral_theorem","1: Line_integral","1: Rectifiable_path","1: Simply_connected","1: Open_subset","1: Complex_plane","1: Cauchy's_integral_formula","1: Contour_integral","1: Curve_orientation","1: Conformal_map","1: Commutative_ring","1: Complex_vector_space","1: Locally_convex_topological_vector_space","1: Suprema","1: Compact_set","1: Exterior_derivative","1: Jordan_curve_theorem","1: Stokes'_theorem","1: Polynomial","1: Coefficient","1: Sine","1: Cosine","1: Exponential_function","1: Eulers_formula_in_complex_analysis","1: Complex_logarithm","1: Square_root","1: Real_part","1: Imaginary_part","1: Complex_conjugation","1: Several_complex_variables","1: Polydisk","1: Cartesian_product","1: If_and_only_if","1: Square-integrable","1: Functional_analysis","1: FrÃ©chet_derivative","1: GÃ¢teaux_derivative","1: Banach_space","1: Antiholomorphic_function","1: Biholomorphy","1: Meromorphic_function","1: Quadrature_domains"]}
