Distinct from the history of Planet Earth\n(which includes early geologic history and prehuman biological eras), world\nhistory comprises the study of archeological and written records, from ancient\ntimes on. Ancient recorded history begins with the invention of\nwriting. According to David Diringer (\"Writing\", [[Encyclopedia Americana]],\n1986 ed., vol. 29, p. 558), \"Writing gives permanence to men's knowledge and\nenables them to communicate over great distances.... The complex society of a\nhigher civilization would be impossible without the art of writing.\" Webster, H. (1921).\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=cboXAAAAIAAJ World history]. Boston: D.C.\nHeath. [http://books.google.com/books?id=cboXAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR5&pg=PA27 Page\n27]. However, the roots of civilization reach back to the period before\nthe invention of writing. Prehistory begins in the Paleolithic Era, or \"Early\nStone Age,\" which is followed by the Neolithic Era, or New Stone Age, and the\nAgricultural Revolution (between 8000 and 5000 BCE) in the Fertile Crescent. The\nNeolithic Revolution marked a change in human history, as humans began the\nsystematic husbandry of plants and animals. {{cite book\n | last = Tudge | first = Colin | authorlink = Colin Tudge title = year = 1998 |\n | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | isbn = 0-297-84258-7\n}} Bellwood, Peter.

Agriculture advanced, and most humans graduated from a nomadic to a\nsettled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements. Nomadism continued in\nmuch of society, especially in isolated regions with few domesticable plant\nspecies; See Jared Diamond, [[Guns, Germs and Steel]]. but the\nrelative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed human\ncommunities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in\ntransportation.\n\nAs farms developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated, and prompted a\ndivision of labor to store food between growing seasons. Labour divisions then\nled to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities. The\ngrowing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of writing and\naccounting. Many cities developed on the banks of lakes\nand rivers and by 3000 BCE, some of the first prominent, well-developed\nsettlements had arisen in Mesopotamia, {{cite book\n | last = McNeill | first = Willam H. | authorlink = William Hardy McNeill title\n | = A World History | origyear = 1967 | edition = 4th | year = 1999 publisher =\n | Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-19-511615-1 page =\n | 15 | chapter = In The Beginning\n}} on the banks of Egypt's River Nile, and in the Indus River\nvalley. Similar civilizations probably\ndeveloped along major rivers in China, but the archaeological evidence for\nextensive urban construction is less conclusive.\n\nThe history of the Old World (Europe in particular, but also the Near East and\nNorth Africa) is commonly divided into Antiquity, up to 476 CE; the Middle\nAges, from the 5th through the 15th centuries, including\nthe Islamic Golden Age (c.750 CE â c.1258 CE) and the early European\nRenaissance (beginning around 1300 CE); Burckhardt, Jacob (1878),\n[http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/hy309/docs/burckhardt/burckhardt.html The\nCivilization of the Renaissance in Italy], trans S.G.C Middlemore, republished\nin 1990 ISBN 0-14-044534-X the Early Modern period, from the 15th century to the late 18th, including the Age\nof Enlightenment; and the Late Modern period, from the Industrial Revolution to\nthe present, including Contemporary History. In Western histories, the\nostensible \"Fall of Rome\" in 476 CE is commonly taken as signaling the end of\nantiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. By contrast, Eastern Europe saw\na transition from the Roman Empire to the Byzantine Empire, which did not\ndecline until much later. In the mid-15th century, Johannes Gutenberg's\ninvention of modern printing, employing movable type, revolutionized\ncommunication, helping end the Middle Ages and usher in the Scientific\nRevolution.
