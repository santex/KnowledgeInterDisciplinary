Where the exhaustive search is\nimpractical, heuristic methods are used to speed up the process of finding a\nsatisfactory solution via mental shortcuts to ease the cognitive load of making\na decision. Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated\nguess, an intuitive judgment, stereotyping, or common sense.\n\nIn more precise terms, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible,\nthough loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human\nbeings and machines.<ref>Pearl, Judea (1983).
