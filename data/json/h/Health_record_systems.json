In\nsome cases this sharing can occur by way of network-connected enterprise-wide\ninformation systems and other information networks or exchanges. EHRs may\ninclude a range of data, including demographics, medical history, medication and\nallergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital\nsigns, personal stats like
