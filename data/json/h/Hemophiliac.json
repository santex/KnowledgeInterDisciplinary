Haemophilia A (clotting factor VIII deficiency) is the most common form\nof the disorder, present in about 1 in 5,000â10,000 male births. Haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) occurs in around 1 in about\n20,000â34,000 male births.\n\nLike most recessive sex-linked, X chromosome disorders, haemophilia is more\nlikely to occur in males than females. This is because females have two X\nchromosomes while males have only one, so the defective gene is guaranteed to\nmanifest in any male who carries it. Because females have two X chromosomes and\nhaemophilia is rare, the chance of a female having two defective copies of the\ngene is very remote, so females are almost exclusively asymptomatic carriers of\nthe disorder. Female carriers can inherit the defective gene from either their\nmother or father, or it may be a new mutation. Although it is not impossible for\na female to have haemophilia, it is unusual: a female with haemophilia A or B\nwould have to be the daughter of both a male haemophiliac and a female carrier,\nwhile the non-sex-linked haemophilia C due to coagulant factor XI deficiency,\nwhich can affect either sex, is more common in Jews of Ashkenazi (east European)\ndescent but rare in other population groups.\n\nHaemophilia lowers blood plasma clotting factor levels of the coagulation\nfactors needed for a normal clotting process. Thus when a blood vessel is\ninjured, a temporary scab does form, but the missing coagulation factors prevent\nfibrin formation, which is necessary to maintain the blood clot. A haemophiliac\ndoes not bleed more intensely than a person without it, but can bleed for a much\nlonger time. In severe haemophiliacs even a minor injury can result in blood\nloss lasting days or weeks, or even never healing completely. In areas such as\nthe brain or inside joints, this can be fatal or permanently debilitating.\n","linknr":694,"url":"Hemophiliac","recorded":1362503708,"links":72,"instances":["genetics","alix_of_hesse"],"pdf":["http://www.wfh.org/2/docs/Publications/Statistics/2008_Global_Survey_Report.pdf","http://www.wfh.org/2/docs/Publications/General_Guides/Exercise_Guide_med.pdf","http://www.haemophilia.org.uk/UserFiles/An%20Introduction%20to%20Haemophilia%20.pdf"],"categories":["Haemophilia"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Causes","Diagnosis","Management","Epidemiology","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/PBB_Protein_F8_image.jpg/230px-PBB_Protein_F8_image.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/XlinkRecessive.jpg/220px-XlinkRecessive.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d0/Factor_VIII_concentrate_in_Commercial_Packaging.JPG/220px-Factor_VIII_concentrate_in_Commercial_Packaging.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/The_Young_Queen_Victoria.jpg/220px-The_Young_Queen_Victoria.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Ryan_White.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dominance","genetics"],["alexandra_feodorovna","alix_of_hesse"],["alfonso,_prince_of_asturias","1907–1938"]],"members":["dominance","alexandra_feodorovna"],"related":["Factor_VIII","North_America","Greek_language","Heredity","Genetic_disorder","Blood","Coagulation","Blood_vessel","Haemophilia_A","Factor_VIII","Haemophilia_B","Factor_IX","Recessive","Sex-linked","X_chromosome","Asymptomatic_carrier","Factor_XI","Ashkenazi","Clotting_factor","Fibrin","Symptom","Prothrombin_time","Thrombin_time","Partial_thromboplastin_time","Internal_bleeding","Joint","Muscles","Subcutaneous","Circumcision","Bruise","Hematoma","Soft_tissue","Dentistry","Surgery","Hemarthrosis","Arthritis","Nausea","Brain_damage","Death","Life_expectancy","Quality_of_life","Bleeding","Hepatitis","Cirrhosis","Autosome","Factor_XI","Heterozygous","Y_chromosome","Allele","Lyonisation","Menorrhagia","Colour_blindness","Genetic_carrier","Genetic_testing","Genetic_counselling","Prenatal_testing","Amniocentesis","Mutation","Genetic_fingerprinting","Von_Willebrand_disease","Dominance_(genetics)","Vitamin_K_deficiency","Vitamin_K","Symbiotic","Gut_flora","Haemorrhagic_disease_of_the_newborn","Blood_serum","Recombinant_DNA","Antibodies","Porcine","Factor_VII","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Wyeth","Chinese_Hamster_Ovary_cell","Human_plasma","MRI","Health_costs","United_States_dollar","The_New_York_Times","Hypnosis","New_York_Times","Anticoagulant","Heparin","Warfarin","Side_effects","Aspirin","Ibuprofen","Naproxen_sodium","Side_effect","Motorcycling","Skateboarding","American_football","Hockey","Boxing","Wrestling","Rugby_football","Association_football","Baseball","Basketball","Abulcasis","John_Conrad_Otto","Color_blindness","John_Dalton","The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","%C3%85land_Islands","Friedrich_Hopff","University_of_Zurich","Harvard","Haemophilia_in_European_royalty","Queen_Victoria","Leopold,_Duke_of_Albany","House_of_Bourbon","Hohenzollern","Romanov","Tsarevich_Alexei_Nikolaevich_of_Russia","Nicholas_II","Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)","Rasputin","Tsarevich_Alexei_of_Russia","Aspirin","Princess_Beatrice_of_the_United_Kingdom","Victoria_Eugenie_of_Battenberg","Alfonso,_Prince_of_Asturias_(1907–1938)","Infante_Gonzalo_of_Spain","HIV","AIDS","Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products","HIV","Hepatitis_C","Hepatitis","Pasteurise","Lindsay_Tribunal","Coagulopathy","Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products","List_of_haemophilia_organisations","Purpura_secondary_to_clotting_disorders"]}
