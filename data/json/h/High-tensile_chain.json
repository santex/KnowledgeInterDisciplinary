{"cursor":"1487","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n-shaped links.]] A 'high-tensile chain', also referred to as a 'transport\nchain', is a link chain with a high tensile strength used for drawing or\nsecuring loads. This type of chain usually consist of broad (thick/heavy)\nmetal, oblong torus-shaped links for high strength. All the links of the chain\nare usually identical, and on the ends are usually two hooks of the\nappropriate size and strength to slide easily over one chain link but small\nenough not let the links slip by. When the ability to grasp the load is\nrequired, a slip hook is used.\n\nThe chain used for tire chains on tractors and some automobiles for better\ntraction is very similar; usually consisting of the same type of link,\nespecially so for snow chains; however, instead of being a single chain, it is\nmore of a network of interconnected chains with no hooked ends; the size and\ndesign of the network depending on the tire it was intended for.\n\nIn summary; transport chains are high strength chains used in imprecise\napplications where much strength is needed yet the task served is rather\nstraightforward.\n","linknr":99,"url":"High-tensile_chain","recorded":1362476870,"links":13,"instances":["device"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chains","Mechanical power control","Mechanical power transmission"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Broad_chain_closeup.jpg/220px-Broad_chain_closeup.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hoist","device"]],"members":["hoist"],"related":["Link_chain","Tensile_strength","Chain","Rectangle","Torus","Lifting_hook","Slip_hook","Tire_chain","Tractor","Automobile","Snow_chains","Hoist_(device)","Lifting_hook","Shackle","Clevis_fastener"]}
