Two molecules of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and\n| H4) form an octamer, around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in\n| repeating units, called nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with\n| linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin\n| into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of\n| the histone H4 family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead\n| contain a palindromic termination element. This gene is found in the large\n| histone gene cluster on chromosome 6.\n}}\n","linknr":164,"url":"HIST1H4G","recorded":1362481087,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/PBB_GE_HIST1H4G_208551_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_HIST1H4G_208551_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene"]}
