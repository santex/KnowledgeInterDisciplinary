Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around\n| a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A,\n| H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the\n| interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to\n| form higher order chromatin structures. This gene encodes a replication-\n| independent member of the histone H2A family that is distinct from other\n| members of the family. Studies in mice have shown that this particular histone\n| is required for embryonic development and indicate that lack of functional\n| histone H2A leads to embryonic lethality. Histone H2AZ is\n| a variant of histone H2A, and is used to mediate the thermosensory response,\n| and is essential to perceive the ambient temperature.Nucleosome occupancy of\n| H2A.Z decreases with temperature, and in vitro assays show that H2A.Z-\n| containing nucleosomes wrap DNA more tightly than canonical H2A nucleosomes in\n| Arabidopsis.(Cell 140: 136â147, 2010) However, in some of the other studies\n| (Nat. Genet. 41, 941â945 and Genes Dev., 21, 1519â1529) have shown that\n| incorporation of H2A.Z in nucleosomes, makes them weaker. Positioning of H2A.Z\n| containing nucleosomes around transcription start sites has now been shown to\n| affect the downstream gene expression.
