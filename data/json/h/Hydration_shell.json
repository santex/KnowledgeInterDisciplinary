{"cursor":"2143","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" ion dissolved in water]] A 'solvation shell' is a shell of any chemical species\n that acts as a solvent and surrounds a solute species. When the solvent is\n water it is often referred to as a 'hydration shell' or 'hydration sphere'.\n\nA classic example is when water molecules form a sphere around a metal ion. The\nelectronegative oxygen atom contained in the water molecule is attracted\nelectrostatically to the positive charge on the metal ion. The result is a\nsolvation shell of water molecules that surround the ion. This shell can be\nseveral molecules thick, dependent upon the charge of the ion.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Hydration_shell","recorded":1362675315,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Solutions"],"headings":["Hydration shells of proteins","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Na%2BH2O.svg/220px-Na%2BH2O.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Vacuum_Dewar_Flask_Red.svg/17px-Vacuum_Dewar_Flask_Red.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ion","Chemical_species","Solvent","Solution","Water","Electronegative","Molecular_dynamics","Water_model","Poisson-Boltzmann_equation"]}
