With extensive grassy patches and pathways, open woodlands\n:and abundant wildlife, it evoked a country estate in England. Bill Gammage has\n:discovered this was because Aboriginal people managed the land in a far more\n:systematic and scientific fashion than we have ever realised.\n\n::For over a decade, he has examined written and visual records of the\n:Australian landscape. He has uncovered an extraordinarily complex system of\n:land management using fire, the life cycles of native plants, and the natural\n:flow of water to ensure plentiful wildlife and plant foods throughout the year.\n\n::We know Aboriginal people spent far less time and effort than Europeans in\n:securing food and shelter, and now we know how they did it. With details of land-\n:management strategies from around Australia, The Biggest Estate on Earth\n:rewrites the history of this continent, with huge implications for us today.\n:Once Aboriginal people were no longer able to tend their country, it became\n:overgrown and vulnerable to the hugely damaging bushfires we now experience.\n\n::... And what we think of as virgin bush in a national park is nothing of\n::the kind.\n}} Agriculture has undergone significant developments since the time of\nthe earliest cultivation. The Fertile Crescent of Western Asia, Egypt, and India\nwere sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had\npreviously been gathered in the wild. Independent development of agriculture\noccurred in northern and southern China, Africa's Sahel, New Guinea and several\nregions of the Americas. In particular,\n[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25creature.html?_r=1 the history of\nmaize cultivation in southern Mexico dates back 9000 years.] New York Times, accessdate=2010-5-\n4 Agricultural practices such as irrigation, crop rotation, fertilizers,\nand pesticides were developed long ago but have made great strides in the past\ncentury. The Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a\nmajor breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints.\n\nIn the past century, agriculture has been characterized by enhanced\nproductivity, the replacement of human labor by synthetic fertilizers and\npesticides, selective breeding, and mechanization. The recent history of\nagriculture has been closely tied with a range of political issues including\nwater pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs, and farm\nsubsidies. In recent years, there has been a backlash against the external\nenvironmental effects of mechanized agriculture, and increasing support for the\norganic movement and sustainable agriculture.\n","linknr":1100,"url":"History_of_agriculture","recorded":1362373574,"links":47,"instances":["bird","fruit","geography","grape","official","plant","agriculture","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/01/27/52/LPAS12BillGammage1.pdf","http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/01/27/52/LPAS12BillGammage1.pdf"],"categories":["History
