But there need not be a\n continuous deformation for two spaces to be homeomorphic — only a continuous\n mapping with a continuous inverse.]] In the mathematical field of topology, a\n 'homeomorphism' or 'topological isomorphism' or 'bicontinuous function' is a\n continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse\n function. Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological\n spaces&mdash;that is, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological\n properties of a given space. Two spaces with a homeomorphism between them are\n called 'homeomorphic', and from a topological viewpoint they are the same. The\n word homeomorphism comes from the Greek words [[wikt:ὅμοιος|ὅμοιος]] (homoios)\n = similar and [[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]] (morphē) = shape, form.\n\nRoughly speaking, a topological space is a geometric object, and the\nhomeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending of the object into a new\nshape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere\nand a donut are not. An often-repeated mathematical joke is that topologists\ncan't tell their coffee cup from their donut,<ref></ref> since a sufficiently\npliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a\ndimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in a\ncup's handle.\n\nTopology is the study of those properties of objects that do not change when\nhomeomorphisms are applied. As Henri Poincaré famously said, mathematics is not\nthe study of objects, but instead, the relations (isomorphisms for instance)\nbetween them.<ref></ref>\n","title":"homeomorphism","headings":["Definition","Examples","Notes","Properties","Informal discussion","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Homotopy","3: Torus","2: Mathematics","2: Inverse_function","2: Isomorphism","2: Category_of_topological_spaces","2: Topological_property","2: Sphere","2: Open_mapping","2: Uniform_isomorphism","2: Isometric_isomorphism","2: Homotopy#Isotopy","2: Mapping_class_group","1: Topology","1: Continuous_function","1: Topological_spaces","1: Greek_language","1: Geometry","1: Circle","1: Mathematical_joke","1: Henri_Poincaré","1: Topological_space","1: Bijection","1: Injective_function","1: Onto","1: Equivalence_relation","1: Equivalence_class","1: Unit_square","1: Real_number","1: Product_topology","1: Dimension","1: 2-sphere","1: Real_line","1: Compact-open_topology","1: Topological_group","1: Torsor","1: Compact_space","1: Connectedness","1: Hausdorff_space","1: Homology_group","1: Metric_space","1: Closed_mapping","1: Open_set","1: Closed_set","1: Alexander's_trick","1: Line_segment","1: Homotopy_equivalence","1: Identity_function","1: Local_homeomorphism","1: Diffeomorphism","1: Uniform_spaces","1: Metric_spaces","1: Dehn_twist","1: Poincaré_conjecture"]}
