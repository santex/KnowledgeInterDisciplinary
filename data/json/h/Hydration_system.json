It is intended to help its user drink enough liquid to\nsupport the physical effort involved in the activity. Such systems for consumers\nwere first sold to cyclists, and by the 1990s had also found a substantial\nmarket among hikers. Familiar commercial models can also be recognized\noccasionally worn by western military personnel in southwest Asia.\n\nIn practice, such a system is almost always a commercially manufactured unit\nthat features at least\n* a flexible bladder of one or a few liters' (quarts') capacity with some means,\n  usually a screwtop, to fill and then reliably seal it,\n* a light hose to convey the beverage to the user's mouth, and\n* a bite valve that starts and stops the flow through the hose with minimal\n  effort. Also common are designs that include specific hands-free means to\n  comfortably carry the hydration system.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Hydration_system","recorded":1362675315,"links":13,"instances":["optics","microbiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Camping equipment"],"headings":["History","Hardware","Techniques","See also","Manufacturers"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Platypus_Hydration_System.JPG/220px-Platypus_Hydration_System.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transparency","optics"],["sterilization","microbiology"]],"members":["transparency","sterilization"],"related":["Recreation","Outdoor_activities","Liquid","Consumer","Cyclist","Hiker","Southwest_Asia","Liter","Quart","Dimension","Vertical_direction","Torso","Volume","Thickness","Backpack","Hydration_pack","Freezing","CamelBak","D-rings","Cylindrical","Bacterial","Ice_cubes","Temperature","Humidity","Calories","Flavoring","Rehydration","Transparency_(optics)","Nalgene","Water_purification","Aesthetic","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Ambient_temperature","Hydration","Hydrational_fluid","CamelBak","Capital_Safety","Mountain_Safety_Research","Nalgene"]}
