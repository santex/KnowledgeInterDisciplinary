{"cursor":"17608","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n hypothesis, demonstrating the planetary motions in eccentric and\n epicyclical orbits]]\n\nA 'hypothesis' (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon.\nFor a hypothesis to be a 'scientific hypothesis', the scientific method requires\nthat one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on\nprevious observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available\nscientific theories. Even though the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" are often\nused synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific\ntheory]]. A scientific hypothesis is a proposed explanation of a phenomenon\nwhich still has to be rigorously tested. In contrast, a scientific theory has\nundergone extensive testing and is generally accepted to be the accurate\nexplanation behind an observation. A 'working hypothesis' is a\nprovisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research.\n\nA different meaning of the term hypothesis is used in formal logic, to denote\nthe antecedent of a proposition; thus in the proposition \"If P, then Q\", P\ndenotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); Q can be called a consequent. P is the\nin a (possibly counterfactual) [[wiktionary:what if|What If]] question.\n\nThe adjective hypothetical, meaning \"having the nature of a hypothesis\", or\n\"being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis\", can refer\nto any of these meanings of the term \"hypothesis\".\n","linknr":343,"url":"Hypotheses","recorded":1362506387,"links":84,"instances":["narrative","logic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific method","Imagination","Mental structures","Philosophy of science"],"headings":["Uses","Scientific hypothesis","Working hypothesis","Hypotheses, concepts and measurement","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg/220px-Cellarius_Harmonia_Macrocosmica_-_Hypothesis_Ptolemaica.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["antecedent","logic"],["plot","narrative"]],"members":["plot","antecedent"],"related":["Orbit","Explanation","Phenomenon","Scientific_method","Testable","Observation","Theory","Research","Formal_logic","Antecedent_(logic)","Proposition","Consequent","Counterfactual_conditional","Plot_(narrative)","Theatre_of_ancient_Greece","Ancient_Greek","Plato","Socrates","Virtue","Wilbur_Knorr","Gregory_Vlastos","Calculation","Morris_Raphael_Cohen","Ernest_Nagel","Robert_Bellarmine","Galileo_Galilei","Mathematical_model","Conservation_of_energy","Constant_of_motion","Sadi_Carnot","James_Prescott_Joule","Emmy_Noether","Existential_quantification","Universal_quantification","Prediction","Reasoning","Deductive_reasoning","Experiment","Laboratory","Nature","Karl_Popper","Falsificationism","Verificationism","Confirmation_holism","Scientific_method","Crucial_experiment","Thought_experiment","Experience","Hans_Christian_Ã˜rsted","Richard_Feynman","Testability","Falsifiability","Parsimony","Occam's_razor","Entity","The_Century_Company","Exploratory_research","Conceptual_framework","Patricia_M._Shields","Journal_of_Public_Affairs_Education","Patricia_M._Shields","Imre_Lakatos","Paul_Feyerabend","Concept","D-N","Proposition","Conceptual_framework","Conceptual_framework","Carl_Gustav_Hempel","Conceptual_framework","Correlation","Statistical_test","Null_hypothesis","Alternative_hypothesis","Sample_size","Axiom","Case_study","Conceptual_framework","Confirmation_holism","Conjecture","Explanandum","Hypothesis_theory","Cognitive_psychology","Logic","Logical_positivism","Operationalization","Isaac_Newton","Reductionism","Research_design","Scientific_method","Scientific_theory","Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge","Theorem","Theory","Thought_experiment","Working_hypothesis"]}
