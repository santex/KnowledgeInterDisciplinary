In botany, a\nhost plant is one that supplies food resources and substrate for certain insects\nor other fauna. Examples of such interactions include a cell being host to a\nvirus, a bean plant hosting helpful nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and animals as\nhosts to parasitic worms, e.g. nematodes.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Host_cells","recorded":1362574350,"links":41,"instances":["biology","biology","epidemiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biological interactions"],"headings":["Definitions","Host range","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Roof_rat-%28rattus_rattus%29.jpg/220px-Roof_rat-%28rattus_rattus%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vector","epidemiology"],["cell","biology"],["vector","epidemiology"],["strain","biology"],["vector","epidemiology"]],"members":["strain","cell","vector"],"related":["Bubonic_plague","Oriental_rat_flea","Vector_(epidemiology)","Biology","Parasite","Commensal","Symbiont","Botany","Fauna","Cell_(biology)","Fabaceae","Rhizobia","Animal","Worm","Nematode","Trypanosoma_brucei","African_trypanosomiasis","Human","Tsetse_fly","Cestode","Flatworm","Biological_life_cycle","Sludge_worm","Whirling_disease","Roundworm","Trichinosis","Muscle","Vector_(epidemiology)","Epidemiology","Antigenic_shift","Vaccine","Strain_(biology)","Aposymbiotic","Host_cell_factor_C1","Intermediate_host","PHI-base","Symbiosis","Vector_(epidemiology)"]}
