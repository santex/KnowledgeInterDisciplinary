{"cursor":"5401","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Hip' is a slang term meaning fashionably current and in the know. Hip is the\nopposite of square or prude.\n\nHip, like [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]], does not refer to one specific quality.\nWhat is considered hip is continuously changing. The term hip is recorded in\nAfrican American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the early 1900s, derived from the\nearlier form hep. In the 1930s and 1940s, it had become a common slang term,\nparticularly in the African-American dominated jazz scene. Despite research and\nspeculation by both amateur and professional etymologists, the previous origins\nof the term hip and hep are disputed. Many etymologists believe that the terms\nhip, hep and hepcat derive from the west African Wolof language word hepicat,\nwhich means \"one who has his eyes open\". Holloway, Joseph E.\n[http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_languages.htm The Impact of\nAfrican Languages on American English]. Retrieved on 2006.10.05. Some\netymologists reject this, however, tracing the origin of this putative etymology\nto David Dalby, a scholar of African Languages who tentatively suggested the\nidea in the 1960s, {{Citation\n | last = Sheidlower first = Jesse author-link = Jesse Sheidlower date = 2004-12-\n | 08 title = Crying Wolof: Does the word hip really hail from a West African\n | language? publisher = [[Slate Magazine]] url =\n | http://www.slate.com/id/2110811/ accessdate = 2007-05-07}}.\nand some have even adopted the denigration \"to cry Wolof\" as a general dismissal\nor belittlement of etymologies they believe to be based on \"superficial\nsimilarities\" rather than documented attribution. e.g. Grant Barrett, \"[htt-\np://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/grantbarrett/humdinger_of_a_bad_irish_schol-\nar/ Humdinger of a Bad Irish Scholar]\", in \"The Lexicographer's Rules\",\n2007.11.09\n\nAlternative theories trace the word's origins to those who used opium\nrecreationally in the 19th century. Opium smokers commonly consumed the drug\nlying on their sides, or on the hip, but this etymology is rejected by\nSheidlower. Because opium smoking was a practice of socially\ninfluential trend-setting individuals, the cachet it enjoyed led to the\ncirculation of the term hip by way of a kind of synecdoche. Another explanation\nwas that users would develop a sore on their hips from lying motionless on it.\nThus to \"have the hip\" was to be an initiate.\n\nEarly currency of the term (as the past participle hipped, meaning informed), is\ndocumented in the 1914 novel The Auction Block by Rex Beach:\n:\"His collection of Napoleana is the finest in this country; he is an authority\n:on French history of that period - in fact, he's as nearly hipped on the\n:subject as a man of his powers can be considered hipped on anything\" Rex\n:Beach, (1914) The Auction Block, New York: A. L. Burt, p.91-92.\n\nIn 1947, Harry \"The Hipster\" Gibson wrote the song \"It Ain't Hep\" about the\nswitch from hep to ''hip':'  Hey you know there's a lot of talk\ngoing around about this hip and hep jive. Lots of people are going around saying\n\"hip.\" Lots of squares are coming out with \"hep.\" Well the hipster is here to\ninform you what the jive is all about.  ''The jive is hip, don't say\nhep ''That's a slip of the lip, let me give you a tip ''Don't you ever\nsay hep it ain't hip, NO IT AIN'T ''It ain't hip to be loud and wrong\n''Just because you're feeling strong ''You try too hard to make a hit\n''And every time you do you tip your mitt ''It ain't hip to blow your\ntop ''The only thing you say is mop, mop, mop ''Keep cool fool, like a\nfish in the pool ''That's the golden rule at the Hipster school ''You\nfind yourself talking too much ''Then you know you're off the track\n''That's the stuff you got to watch ''Everybody wants to get into the\nact ''It ain't hip to think you're \"in there\" ''Just because of the\nzooty suit you wear ''You can laugh and shout but you better watch out\n''Cause you don't know what it's all about, man ''Man you ain't hip if you\ndon't get hip to this hip and hep jive ''Now get it now, look out\n''Man get hip with the hipster, YEAH! ''Got to do it! ''be hip not hep, coz\nhep is not hip  so just be hip and pray you dont slip!
