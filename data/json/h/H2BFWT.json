{"cursor":"1474","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'H2B histone family, member W, testis-specific' is a protein that in humans is\nencoded by the H2BFWT gene.\n\nHistones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome\nstructure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Two molecules of each of the\nfour core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which\napproximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes.\nThe linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and\nfunctions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene\nencodes a member of the H2B histone family that is specifically expressed in\nsperm nuclei. A polymorphism in the 5' UTR of this gene is associated with male\ninfertility.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2010].\n","linknr":141,"url":"H2BFWT","recorded":1362481049,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene","Nucleosome"]}
