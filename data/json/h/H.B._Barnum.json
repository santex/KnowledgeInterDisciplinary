{"cursor":"3733","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'H. B. Barnum' (born Hidle Brown Barnum, 15 July 1936, Houston, Texas) is an\nAmerican pianist, arranger, record producer, songwriter, and former child actor.\n\nAfter winning a nationwide talent contest at the age of four and starring in the\nmotion picture Valley of the Sun Marches On, he continued his acting career on\nTV in the Amos 'n Andy Shows, the Jack Benny Show, and others, making his first\nsolo recording as Pee Wee Barnum in 1950. [ Biography by Jason\nAnkent at Allmusic.org] [http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/H.B.Barnum.html Biographical\nnote at SoulWalking.com]\n\nHe then joined doo-wop groups The Dootones and, in 1956, The Robins (later The\nCoasters), for whom he played piano. In 1960, under the pseudonym \"Dudley\" he\nrecorded the radio hit \"El Pizza,\" a parody of Marty Robbins' \"El Paso\". In 1961\nhe had the only hit under his own name, the instrumental \"Lost Love\", and in the\nsame year recorded the first version of \"Nut Rocker\", credited to Jack B. Nimble\nand the Quicks. He also recorded three albums as a singer-pianist during the\n1960s.\n\nIn 1962, Barnum, in collaboration with Bill Aken and Lan-Cet Records did the big\nband arrangement for the 1962 gubernatorial campaign recording to tie in with\nGoodwin \"Goody\" Knight's bid for re-election as Governor of California. Johnny\nMercergave the o.k. for using Aken's re-written lyrics to his old standard of\n\"Goody Goody.\" In spite of the fact that it was done for a political campaign,\nthe band's final recording was a superlative work of musical genius on the part\nof Barnum and Aken. Goodwin Knight subsequently pulled out of the campaign and\ncopies of the record are very rare and hard to find.\n\nSince that time he has become most widely known as an arranger, for a very wide\nrange of performers including Lou Rawls, Count Basie, O.C. Smith, Frank Sinatra,\nThe Supremes, Aretha Franklin, Little Richard, Gladys Knight, Al Wilson, and the\nPump Girls. Barnum also produced,\nalong with Johnnie Walls of JWP Productions which distributed the record, the\n1985 hip-hop comedy song \"Rappin' Duke.\" In addition, he also produced \"The Fish\nSong\", a rare song by The New Creation, released on Salaam Records.\n\nH.B. Barnum had an album recorded by the Novells, a Los Angeles area band,\ntitled, That Did It! in 1968. The album which never was properly promoted\nsurprisingly re-emerged as an import some 40-years later when it was\nreleased in the United Kingdom in July 2005 and again in December 2007 by\nRadioactive Records.\n\nH. B. Barnum is the older brother of backup singer Billie Barnum.\n","linknr":139,"url":"H.B._Barnum","recorded":1375054399,"links":["/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/H._B._Barnum","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=H.B._Barnum&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Houston,_Texas","/wiki/Texas","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Pianist","/wiki/Arrangement","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Songwriter","/wiki/Actor","/wiki/Film","/wiki/Television","/wiki/Amos_%27n_Andy_Show","/wiki/Jack_Benny","/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction","#cite_note-amg-1","#cite_note-soulwalking-2","/wiki/Doo-wop","/w/index.php?title=The_Dootones&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/The_Coasters","/wiki/Parody","/wiki/Marty_Robbins","/wiki/El_Paso_(song)","/wiki/Chart-topper","/wiki/Instrumental","/wiki/B._Bumble_and_the_Stingers","/wiki/Album","#cite_note-amg-1","#cite_note-soulwalking-2","/wiki/Goodwin_Knight","/wiki/Johnny_Mercer","/wiki/Goody_Goody","/wiki/Lou_Rawls","/wiki/Count_Basie","/wiki/O.C._Smith","/wiki/Frank_Sinatra","/wiki/The_Supremes","/wiki/Aretha_Franklin","/wiki/Little_Richard","/wiki/Gladys_Knight","/wiki/Al_Wilson_(singer)","/wiki/Pump_Girls","#cite_note-amg-1","#cite_note-soulwalking-2","/wiki/Rappin%27_Duke","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-amg_1-0","#cite_ref-amg_1-1","#cite_ref-amg_1-2","http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p54446/biography","#cite_ref-soulwalking_2-0","#cite_ref-soulwalking_2-1","#cite_ref-soulwalking_2-2","http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/H.B.Barnum.html","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/12514410","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&oldid=561991005","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1936_births","/wiki/Category:American_child_actors","/wiki/Category:American_pianists","/wiki/Category:Songwriters_from_Texas","/wiki/Category:Actors_from_Houston,_Texas","/wiki/Category:RCA_Victor_artists","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:American_record_producers","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_September_2009","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=H.+B.+Barnum&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=H.+B.+Barnum","/wiki/H._B._Barnum","/wiki/Talk:H._B._Barnum","#","/wiki/H._B._Barnum","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/H._B._Barnum","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/H._B._Barnum","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&oldid=561991005","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1562542","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=H._B._Barnum&id=561991005","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=H.+B.+Barnum","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=H.+B.+Barnum&oldid=561991005&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=H._B._Barnum&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._B._Barnum","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1562542#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.
