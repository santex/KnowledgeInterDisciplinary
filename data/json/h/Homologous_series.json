{"cursor":"5237","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, a 'homologous series' is a series of compounds with a similar\ngeneral formula, usually varying by a single parameter such as the length of a\ncarbon chain. Examples of such series are the straight-chained alkanes\n(paraffins), and some of their derivatives (such as the primary alcohols,\naldehydes, and (mono)carboxylic acids). The single-ring unbranched cycloalkanes\nform another such series.\n\nCompounds within a homologous series typically have a fixed set of functional\ngroups that gives them similar chemical and physical properties. (For example,\nthe series of primary straight-chained alchools has an hydroxyl at the end of\nthe carbon chain.) These properties typically change gradually along the\nseries, and the changes can often be explained by mere differences in molecular\nsize and mass.\n\nThe name \"homologous series\" is also often used for any collection of compounds\nthat have similar structures or include the same functional group, such as the\ngeneral alkanes (straight and branched), the alkenes (olefins), the\ncarbohydrates, etc. However, if the members cannot be arranged in a linear order\nby a single parameter, the collection may be better called a \"chemical family\"\nor \"class of homologous compounds\" than a \"series\".\n","linknr":155,"url":"Homologous_series","recorded":1362543680,"links":35,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic chemistry"],"headings":["Example: straight-chained alkanes","Examples","Inorganic Homologous Series"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","General_formula","Carbon","Alkane","Alcohol","Aldehyde","Carboxylic_acid","Cycloalkane","Functional_group","Hydroxyl","Functional_group","Alkane","Alkene","Carbohydrate","Methane","Ethane","Propane","Butane","Pentane","Methylene_bridge","Molecular_mass","Atomic_mass","Boiling_point","Dipole","Alcohol","Methanol","Ethanol","1-propanol","1-butanol","Alkanes","Methylene_bridge","Methyl_group","Perfluoroalkane","Difluoromethylene_bridge","Trifluoromethyl","Alkyl","Alkenes","Methylene_group","Alkanes","Alkynes","Methylidyne_group","Polyacetylene","Vinylene_group","Alcohols","Carboxylic_acid","Homologation_reaction","Chemical_process","Organic_chemistry","Titanium","Vanadium","Molybdenum","Oxides"]}
