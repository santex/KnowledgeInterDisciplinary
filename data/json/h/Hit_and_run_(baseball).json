{"cursor":"6631","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'hit and run' is a high risk/high reward offensive strategy used in baseball.\nIt uses a stolen base attempt to try to place the defending infielders out of\nposition for an attempted base hit.\n\nThe hit and run relies on the positioning of the defensive players in the\ninfield. The 1st and 3rd basemen normally stand close to the lines, generally\nnear their bases but slightly closer to home plate. The 2nd baseman and\nshortstop stand on either side of 2nd base, covering the areas between 1st and\n2nd, and 2nd and 3rd, respectively. 2nd base itself is not directly covered, the\npitcher can field hits in this direction.\n\nIn normal play, if the ball is hit in the infield one of the players will run\ntowards the ball while another will run towards the base that is no longer\ncovered. For instance, if the ball is hit toward the 2nd baseman he will run\ntowards the ball, and the shortstop will run towards 2nd base. This allows the\nfielding player to toss the ball to the player on the base to attempt the \"out\".\n\nHowever, during a stolen base attempt this normal turn of events and positioning\nmay be upset. In the typical case, a baserunner on first base will start running\ntowards second, causing the infielders to move towards the base in an attempt to\ntag the runner when the ball is thrown to them from the pitcher or catcher. This\nreaction places the infielders out-of-position for a hit ball, with holes\nopening mid-way between 1st and 2nd and 2nd and 3rd.\n\nThe hit and run takes advantage of this by having the baserunner attempt to\nsteal as soon as the pitch is thrown. The batter then attempts to hit the ball\ninto the developing holes in the field. Ideally, the ball will be hit into a\ngap, and travel into the outfield allowing the runners lots of time to reach\nthe bases.\n\nDepending on the timing, the fielder may not have moved very far from their\nnormal position by the time the ball is hit towards them. But even in this case,\nthe fielder may have turned to run towards the base in order to cover the\nbaserunner. In normal play the fielders would face the batter, allowing them to\nreact in any direction, but after they have turned towards the base this becomes\nmuch more difficult. Their momentum in this direction adds to this problem.\n\nThe hit and run also has defensive qualities. In normal play the baserunner\nwould start towards second base when the ball was hit. If the defensive\nplayers react fast enough, they may be able to throw the ball to 2nd and 1st\nbefore either runner has reached their base, causing a double play. In the\ncase of the hit and run, the baserunner has a huge head start, so the chance\nof them reaching 2nd base after the ball is reduced. The timing may force the\nfielders to attempt the out only at 1st, thereby advancing the runner. It may\nalso allow the runner to advance more bases on a hit than he might otherwise\ndue to that running head start. Although a line drive can easily turn into a\ndouble play, line drives are rare so the risk to getting doubled off from a\nline drive is minimal.\n\nThe risk in the hit and run is that if the batter fails to make contact with the\nball the runner is vulnerable to being thrown out (technically caught stealing)\nat second base. A runner trying to advance on a failed hit-and-\nrun is more likely to be thrown out than a runner attempting a \"straight steal\"\nof second, because the runner is not waiting for the best pitch to steal on, and\ndoes not get the best head start on the way there because he waits a bit longer\nat the original base to preserve the deception a while longer. The\ndefensive team can improve their odds in this case by using a pitchout, having\nthe pitcher throw the ball far outside the strike zone so the fielder can easily\ncatch it and attempt to pick off the runner.\n\nThe batter may choose to take a bad swing at a bad pitch to make it harder for\nthe catcher to handle the incoming pitch, or so the ball goes foul. In each case\nthe runner is allowed to return to 1st, so the attempt protects the runner from\nbeing caught stealing. Either way, this can cause the batter to fall behind in\nthe count, making it harder for him to get a hit. And if he does hit a bad pitch\nhe really can't handle, it could result in poor contact leading directly to the\nbatter being put out, so he may end up giving his at-bat away with no advantage\nto the offense.\n\nThe hit-and-run has the best chance to be successful when the batter is someone\nwho does not frequently swing and miss, at a time when the count won't\ndisadvantage a hitter if he takes a bad swing, with a runner fast enough to take\nsecond base even if the batter does swing and miss.\n\nOften the precise circumstance to call for a hit-and-run occurs with a two\nballs, one strike count on a hitter, as this situation may meet all of the above\ncriteria, depending on who is at bat and who is on base, but it can occur at\nother times. An alert defense understands the probability that the offense will\ncall the play at a specific moment, and thus it may choose to call for a\npitchout at that moment to defend it. An alert offense, in turn, understands the\nprobability of a forthcoming pitchout, and use the hit-and-run opportunity as a\ndecoy, causing the pitchout to become another ball in the count in the hitter's\nfavor, increasing his chances of reaching base by walk or hit.\n\nThe hit-and-run is a very old baseball strategy, dating back to the 19th century\ngame. The terminology is confusing because the \"run\" starts before\nthe \"hit\". And a variant of the hit-and-run is the run-and-hit, in which the\nrunner takes off on a steal attempt of second and the batter has the option of\nwhether or not to swing at the pitch.\n\nThe hit and run is so effective that defence against it is now an automatic part\nof fielding. Generally the 2nd baseman and shortstop will cover the hit and run\npossibility by having the fielder closest to the batter's strong arm be in\ncharge of covering the base. For instance, if the batter is right-handed, the\n2nd baseman will be in charge of covering stolen bases, as the batter will\nlikely send the ball towards the shortstop. Likewise, the shortstop is in charge\nof covering stolen bases when a lefty is on plate.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Hit_and_run_(baseball)","recorded":1375076697,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hit_and_run_(baseball)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hit_and_run_(baseball)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources","/wiki/Talk:Hit_and_run_(baseball)#.23","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hit_and_run_(baseball)&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Base_hit","/wiki/Home_plate","/wiki/Shortstop","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Baserunner","/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)","/wiki/Batter_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_play","/wiki/Line_drive","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Pitchout","/wiki/Strike_zone","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Hit_and_run_(baseball)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Hit_and_run_(baseball)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Baseball_(crop).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1e/Baseball_%28crop%29.jpg/29px-Baseball_%28crop%29.jpg","/wiki/Portal:Baseball","#cite_ref-2","http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Hit-and-run","/wiki/Template:Baseball","/wiki/Template_talk:Baseball","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baseball&action=edit","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Baseball_field","/wiki/Backstop_(baseball)","/wiki/Baseball_field","/wiki/Batter%27s_box","/wiki/Batter%27s_eye","/wiki/Bullpen","/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)","/wiki/Foul_territory","/wiki/Foul_pole","/wiki/Infield","/wiki/On-deck","/wiki/Outfield","/wiki/Strike_zone","/wiki/Warning_track","/wiki/Baseball_clothing_and_equipment","/wiki/Baseball_bat","/wiki/Baseball_(ball)","/wiki/Baseball_glove","/wiki/Batting_glove","/wiki/Batting_helmet","/wiki/Baseball_cap","/wiki/Baseball_doughnut","/wiki/Baseball_stirrups","/wiki/Baseball_uniform","/wiki/Uniform_number_(Major_League_Baseball)","/wiki/Shin_guard","/wiki/Jockstrap#Protective_cup","/wiki/Batting_cage","/wiki/Pitching_machine","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Extra_innings","/wiki/Out_(baseball)","/wiki/Seventh-inning_stretch","/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/On-deck","/wiki/Batting_(baseball)","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Plate_appearance","/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt","/wiki/Sacrifice_fly","/wiki/Slap_bunt","/wiki/Baltimore_chop","/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/Foul_ball","/wiki/Foul_tip","/wiki/Checked_swing","/wiki/Ground_rule_double","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Infield_hit","/wiki/Hit_by_pitch","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Single_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)","/wiki/Inside-the-park_home_run","/wiki/Walk-off_home_run","/wiki/Lefty-righty_switch","/wiki/Double_switch_(baseball)","/wiki/Line_drive","/wiki/Count_(baseball)","/wiki/Sweet_spot_(sports)","/wiki/Pull_hitter","/wiki/Hitting_for_the_cycle","/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)","/wiki/Balk","/wiki/Beanball","/wiki/Breaking_ball","/wiki/Brushback_pitch","/wiki/Changeup","/wiki/Curveball","/wiki/Fastball","/wiki/Full_count","/wiki/Inside_pitching","/wiki/Knuckleball","/wiki/Passed_ball","/wiki/Pitch_count","/wiki/Pitchout","/wiki/Quick_pitch","/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball","/wiki/Slider","/wiki/Spitball","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Striking_out_the_side","/wiki/Wild_pitch","/wiki/Time_of_pitch","/wiki/No-hitter","/wiki/Perfect_game","/wiki/Baserunning","/wiki/Balk","/wiki/Bases_loaded","/wiki/Caught_stealing","/wiki/Left_on_base","/wiki/Safe_(baseball)","/wiki/Scoring_position","/wiki/Small_ball","/wiki/Squeeze_play_(baseball)","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Tag_up","/wiki/Base_on_balls","/wiki/Contact_play","/wiki/Double_play","/wiki/Force_play","/wiki/Hidden_ball_trick","/wiki/In-between_hop","/wiki/Triple_play","/wiki/Unassisted_triple_play","/wiki/Pickoff","/wiki/Wheel_play","/wiki/Catch_(baseball)","/wiki/Fourth_out","/wiki/Rundown","/wiki/Tag_out","/wiki/Appeal_play","/wiki/Assist_(baseball)","/wiki/Infield_shift","/wiki/Wall_climb","/wiki/Fielder%27s_choice","/wiki/Defensive_indifference","/wiki/In_flight","/wiki/Infield_fly_rule","/wiki/Bench-clearing_brawl","/wiki/Pepper_(baseball)","/wiki/Shagging_(baseball)","/wiki/Uncaught_third_stri
