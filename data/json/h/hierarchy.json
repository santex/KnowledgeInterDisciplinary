Abstractly, a hierarchy can be modelled mathematically as a\nrooted tree: the root of the tree forms the top level, and the children of a\ngiven vertex are at the same level, below their common parent.\n\nA hierarchy (sometimes abbreviated HR) can link entities either directly or\nindirectly, and either vertically or horizontally. The only direct links in a\nhierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or\nto one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can\nalso incorporate alternative hierarchies. Indirect hierarchical links can extend\n\"vertically\" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction,\nfollowing a path. All parts of the hierarchy which are not linked vertically to\none another nevertheless can be \"horizontally\" linked through a path by\ntraveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and\nthen down again. This is akin to two co-workers or colleagues; each reports to a\ncommon superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority.\nOrganizational forms exist that are both alternative and complimentary to\nhierarchy. Heterarchy (sometimes abbreviated HT) is one such form.\n","title":"hierarchy","headings":["Nomenclature","History of the term","Visualization","Visual hierarchy","Informal
