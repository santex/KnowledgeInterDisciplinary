These epics lie at the beginning of the Western canon of literature,\nand have had an enormous influence on the history of literature.\n\nWhen he lived is unknown. Herodotus estimates that Homer lived 400 years before\nhis own time, which would place him at around 850 BC,<ref>Herodotus 2.53.</ref>\nwhile other ancient sources claim that he lived much nearer to the supposed time\nof the Trojan War, in the early 12th century BC.<ref></ref> Most modern\nresearchers place Homer in the 7th or 8th centuries BC.\n\nThe formative influence of the Homeric epics in shaping Greek culture was widely\nrecognized, and Homer was described as the teacher of Greece.<ref></ref> Homer's\nworks, which are about fifty percent speeches, provided models in persuasive\nspeaking and writing that were emulated throughout the ancient and medieval\nGreek worlds. Fragments of Homer account for nearly half of all identifiable\nGreek literary papyrus finds.<ref>; Finley's figures are based upon the corpus\nof literary papyri published before 1963.</ref>\n",
