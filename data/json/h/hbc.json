A fur trading business for much of its existence, today\nHudson's Bay Company owns and operates retail stores throughout Canada and the\nUnited States including Hudson's Bay (formerly The Bay), Zellers, Home\nOutfitters and Lord & Taylor. The company head office is in the Simpson Tower in\nToronto, Ontario.<ref>\"[http://www.hbc.com/hbc/about/contacts/ Contacts].\"\nHudson's Bay Company. Retrieved on 7 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe company was incorporated by English royal charter in 1670 as 'The Governor\nand Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay' and functioned\nas the de facto government in parts of North America before European states and\nlater the United States laid claim to those territories. It was at one time the\nlargest landowner in the world, with Rupert's Land having 15% of North American\nacreage. From its long-time headquarters at York Factory on Hudson Bay, the\ncompany controlled the fur trade throughout much of British-controlled North\nAmerica for several centuries. Undertaking early exploration, its traders and\ntrappers forged early relationships with many groups of First Nations/Native\nAmericans. Its network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official\nauthority in many areas of Western Canada and the United States. In the late\n19th century, its vast territory became the largest component in the newly\nformed Dominion of Canada, in which the company was the largest private\nlandowner.\n\nWith the decline of the fur trade, the company evolved into a mercantile\nbusiness selling vital goods to settlers in the Canadian West. The Hudson's Bay\nCompany Archives, a collection of the company's many records and maps, are\nlocated in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nIn July 2008, the company after a series of change of ownership was eventually\nacquired by the American private equity firm, NRDC Equity Partners, which also\nowned department store chain Lord & Taylor.<ref name=GT-DEX-2008-19/> From 2008\nto 2012, HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC, Hudson's Bay Trading\nCompany, which was dissolved on 23 January 2012.<ref name=\"Hudson’s Bay Trading\nCompany dissolved\"/> HBC is now directly managed by NRDC and
