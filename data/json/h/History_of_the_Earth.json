Nearly all branches of\nnatural science have contributed to the understanding of the main events of the\nEarth's past. The age of Earth is approximately one-third of the age of the\nuniverse. An immense amount of biological and geological change has occurred in\nthat time span.\n\nEarth formed around 4.54 billion () years ago by accretion from the solar\nnebula. Volcanic outgassing likely created the primordial atmosphere, but it\ncontained almost no oxygen and would have been toxic to humans and most modern\nlife. Much of the Earth was molten because of extreme volcanism and frequent\ncollisions with other bodies. One very large collision is thought to have been\nresponsible for tilting the Earth at an angle and forming the Moon. Over time,\nthe planet cooled and formed a solid crust, allowing liquid water to exist on\nthe surface. The first life forms appeared between 3.8 and 3.5 billion years\nago. Photosynthetic life appeared around 2 billion years ago, enriching the\natmosphere with oxygen. Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about\n580 million years ago, when complex multicellular life arose. During the\nCambrian period it experienced a rapid diversification into most major phyla.\n\nBiological and geological change has been constantly occurring on our planet\nsince the time of its formation. Organisms continuously evolve, taking on new\nforms or going extinct in response to an ever-changing planet. The process of\nplate tectonics has played a major role in the shaping of Earth's oceans and\ncontinents, as well as the life they harbor. The biosphere, in turn, has had a\nsignificant effect on the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions on the planet,\nsuch as the formation of the ozone layer, the proliferation of oxygen, and the\ncreation of soil. Though humans are unable to perceive it due to their\nrelatively brief life spans, this change is ongoing and will continue for the\nnext few billion years.\n","linknr":2100,"url":"History_of_the_Earth","recorded":1362371952,"links":99,"instances":["biology","geology","astrophysics","journal","continent","biology","biology","planet","geology","journal","geology","cosmology","evolution","astronomy","geology","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/webdav/site/GSL/shared/pdfs/Geoscientist/Download%20PDF%20copy%20of%20Geoscientist%2019.9%20September%202009.pdf","http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/webdav/site/GSL/shared/pdfs/Geoscientist/Download%20PDF%20copy%20of%20Geoscientist%2019.9%20September%202009.pdf","http://www3.geosc.psu.edu/~jfk4/PersonalPage/Pdf/Phl_Trans_B%20(Kasting&Howard)_06.pdf","http://www3.geosc.psu.edu/~jfk4/PersonalPage/Pdf/Phl_Trans_B%20(Kasting&Howard)_06.pdf","http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf","http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf","http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2003/vol4-2//pdf/gmr0070.pdf","http://ool.weizmann.ac.il/Segre_Lipid_World.pdf","http://ool.weizmann.ac.il/Segre_Lipid_World.pdf","http://www.biology-direct.com/content/pdf/1745-6150-1-8.pdf","http://www.biology-direct.com/content/pdf/1745-6150-1-8.pdf","http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/nysgs/resources/images/geologicaltimescale.pdf","http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/nysgs/resources/images/geologicaltimescale.pdf"],"categories":["Geochronology","Geology
