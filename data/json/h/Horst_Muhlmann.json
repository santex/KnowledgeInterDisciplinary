He was a placekicker\nin the American Football League and the National Football League for nine\nseasons. He played for the Kansas City Chiefs (1969), the Cincinnati Bengals\n(from 1969 to 1974) and the Philadelphia Eagles (from 1975 to 1977).\n\nMuhlmann (German spelling \"MÃ¼hlmann\") was born in Dortmund, Germany. After high\nschool, he worked as a bricklayer and part-time soccer player. He played as a\ngoalkeeper for Schalke 04 from 1962 to 1966, including the first ever\nBundesliga (German soccer's top league) season in 1963â64. In 1968, he played\nsoccer in the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the Kansas City Spurs.\n\nHis professional career in American football began in 1969 with the Kansas City\nChiefs when he was 29 years old. Muhlmann quickly established a reputation as\none of the longest kickers in the game. On September 4, 1971, in a pre-season\nencounter with the Green Bay Packers, he launched each of his six kickoffs over\nthe crossbar into the endzone denying the Packers a single kickoff return yard.\nMuhlmann was the first kicker since the AFL-NFL merger to connect on field goals\nof 50 yards or more in three consecutive games. This record has only been\nmatched by three other players: Tom Dempsey (1971), Chris Bahr (1981) and Jason\nElam (1996). Muhlmann held the Bengals team record for consecutive extra points\n(101) until it was broken by Doug Pelfrey in 1997. Muhlmann still holds or\nshares several Bengals regular season and post season\nindividual kicking records.\n\nThe money Muhlmann earned during his time in the U.S. he invested in an\napartment house in Selm where he lived with his family until he died from a long\nchronic disease. The Horst Muhlmann Bars are located in the North and South\nendzones on the Plaza level of Cincinnati's Paul Brown Stadium.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Horst_Muhlmann","recorded":1375056820,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Dortmund,_Germany","/wiki/Selm","/wiki/American_football_positions","/wiki/Placekicker","/wiki/College_football","http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/MuhlHo20.htm","http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=MUHLMHOR01","/wiki/1969_AFL_season","/wiki/1970_NFL_season","/wiki/1974_NFL_season","/wiki/1975_NFL_season","/wiki/1977_NFL_season","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Placekicker","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals","/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles","/wiki/Dortmund,_Germany","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/High_school","/wiki/Bricklayer","/wiki/Soccer","/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)","/wiki/Schalke_04","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Bundesliga","/wiki/North_American_Soccer_League_(1968%E2%80%931984)","/wiki/Kansas_City_Spurs","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/Kickoff_(American_football)","/wiki/Tom_Dempsey","/wiki/Chris_Bahr","/wiki/Jason_Elam","/wiki/Doug_Pelfrey","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Cincinnati","/wiki/Paul_Brown_Stadium","/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/muehlmannhorst/1967/","#cite_ref-2","http://assets.bengals.com/assets/default/mediaguide07_271-288.pdf","#cite_ref-3","http://assets.bengals.com/assets/default/postseason_individual.pdf","/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_American_Football_League_players","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Football_Template_USA.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Football_Template_USA.svg/32px-Football_Template_USA.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Amfoot-kicker-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Amfoot-kicker-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Amfoot-kicker-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/50px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","/wiki/File:Soccerball_mask.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/Soccerball_mask.svg/50px-Soccerball_mask.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&action=edit","/wiki/Template:US-footy-goalkeeper-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:US-footy-goalkeeper-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:US-footy-goalkeeper-stub&action=edit","/wiki/Germany","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/67px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Soccerball_mask2.svg/40px-Soccerball_mask2.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Germany-footy-goalkeeper-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Germany-footy-goalkeeper-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Germany-footy-goalkeeper-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horst_Muhlmann&oldid=561128683","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1940_births","/wiki/Category:1991_deaths","/wiki/Category:German_footballers","/wiki/Category:FC_Schalke_04_players","/wiki/Category:American_soccer_players","/wiki/Category:North_American_Soccer_League_(1968%E2%80%9384)_players","/wiki/Category:Kansas_City_Spurs_players","/wiki/Category:Association_football_goalkeepers","/wiki/Category:American_football_placekickers","/wiki/Category:Cincinnati_Bengals_(AFL)_players","/wiki/Category:Cincinnati_Bengals_players","/wiki/Category:Philadelphia_Eagles_players","/wiki/Category:German_players_of_American_football","/wiki/Category:Bundesliga_players","/wiki/Category:Bricklayers","/wiki/Category:American_football_placekicker_stubs","/wiki/Category:American_soccer_goalkeeper
