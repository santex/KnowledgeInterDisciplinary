{"cursor":"5676","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\"'Hot Rod Lincoln'\" was recorded in 1955 as an answer song to \"Hot Rod Race\", a\n1951 hit for Arkie Shibley and his Mountain Dew Boys. Hot Rod Race tells the\nstory of a late-model Ford and Mercury who end up racing along the highway,\nneither driver gaining an advantage, and staying \"neck and neck\" until they are\nboth overtaken (to their amazement) by a kid in \"a hopped-up Model A\".\n\n\"Hot Rod Lincoln\" was written by Charlie Ryan, who had also recorded a version\nof \"Hot Rod Race\", and W. S. Stevenson. It begins with a direct reference to\nShibley's earlier ballad, stating \"You heard the story of the hot rod race that\nfatal day, when the Ford and the Mercury went out to play. Well, this is the\ninside story and I'm here to say, I'm the kid that was a-drivin' that Model A.\"\n\nRyan owned a real hot rod that was built from a 1948 12-cylinder Lincoln chassis\nshortened two feet and with a 1930 Ford Model A body fitted to it. Thus the song\nexplains how in \"Hot Rod Race\" a kid in a Model A could have outrun late-model\nFord and Mercury sedans. Ryan actually raced his hot rod against a Cadillac\nsedan driven by a friend in Lewiston, Idaho, driving up the Spiral Highway\n(former U.S. 95) to the top of Lewiston Hill. His song, however, keeps the same\nlocation as \"Hot Rod Race\", namely Grapevine Hill, which is an old-time local\nsouthern California nickname for the long, nearly straight grade up Grapevine\nCanyon to Tejon Pass, near the town of Gorman, California, between Los Angeles\nand Bakersfield.\n\nThe first, 1955, release of \"Hot Rod Lincoln\" was recorded by co-writer Ryan,\nrecording as Charlie Ryan and The Livingston Brothers. Gotham Records issue\n412 Ryan's 1959 version, on 4 Star, as Charlie Ryan and The Timberline\nRiders, is probably better known.\n\nThe 1960 version by Johnny Bond was a hit for Republic Records. Bond's Lincoln\nhas eight cylinders (\"and uses them all\"), rather than the 12 cylinders pulling\nRyan's Model A.\n\nThe 1972 release by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen went to #9 on the\nBillboard charts and #7 in Canada. Cody's version opens with the spoken lines,\n\"My Pappy said: Son, you're going to drive me to drinkin' if you don't stop\ndrivin' that hot rod Lincoln.\" Cody's version also uses a slightly different\nguitar riff at the beginning, and adopts parts of Johnny Bond's version,\nincluding the reference to eight cylinders. Cody's version is largely true to\nthe original with changes that most people don't notice. However, the first line\n\"You've heard the story of the hot rod race when the Fords and the Lincolns were\nsetting the pace ...\" completely misses telling the listener that this song is\nthe story of the kid and his Model A that outran the fellows in the late-model\nFord and Mercury in the earlier song, Hot Rod Race.\n\nHot Rod Lincoln and Hot Rod Race are defining anthems of the hot rod community.\n\nArkie Shibley, who recorded a series of Hot Rod Race songs, died in 1975.\nCharlie Ryan died in Spokane, Washington, on February 16, 2008, at age 92. He\nwas a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.\n\nThe actual \"hot rod Lincoln\" was auctioned off at the 2013 Barrett Jackson\nAuto Auction.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Hot_Rod_Lincoln","recorded":1375054397,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Answer_song","/wiki/Hot_Rod_Race","/wiki/Arkie_Shibley","/wiki/Charlie_Ryan","/wiki/Hot_Rod_Race","/wiki/Lincoln-Zephyr_V12_engine","/wiki/Ford_Model_A_(1927%E2%80%931931)","/wiki/Lewiston,_Idaho","/wiki/U.S._Route_95_in_Idaho","/wiki/Hot_Rod_Race","/wiki/Tejon_Pass","/wiki/Gorman,_California","/wiki/Los_Angeles","/wiki/Bakersfield,_California","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Johnny_Bond","/wiki/Republic_Records","/wiki/Commander_Cody_and_His_Lost_Planet_Airmen","/wiki/Billboard_charts","/wiki/Hot_Rod_Race","/wiki/Anthem","/wiki/Hot_rod","/wiki/Rockabilly_Hall_of_Fame","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Texas","/wiki/Western_swing","/wiki/Asleep_at_the_Wheel","/wiki/Bill_Kirchen","/wiki/Pat_Travers","/wiki/Polydor_Records","/wiki/ALL_(band)","/wiki/San_Pedro,_California","/wiki/Jim_Varney","/wiki/The_Beverly_Hillbillies_(film)","/wiki/Jed_Clampett","/wiki/Liquor_in_the_Front","/wiki/Reverend_Horton_Heat","/wiki/Les_Claypool","/wiki/NASCAR_on_Fox","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=edit&section=3","http://www.rockabillyhall.com/HotRodLncln1.html","http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/arkie_shibley.htm","/wiki/Hot_Rod_Race","http://www.hot-rod-lincoln.com/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&oldid=565001091","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Rockabilly_songs","/wiki/Category:1972_songs","/wiki/Category:1950_songs","/wiki/Category:1955_songs","/wiki/Category:Charlie_Ryan_songs","/wiki/Category:Commander_Cody_and_His_Lost_Planet_Airmen_songs","/wiki/Category:Johnny_Bond_songs","/wiki/Category:Songs_about_automobiles","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hot+Rod+Lincoln&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Hot+Rod+Lincoln","/wiki/Hot_Rod_Lincoln","/wiki/Talk:Hot_Rod_Lincoln","#","/wiki/Hot_Rod_Lincoln","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Hot_Rod_Lincoln","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Hot_Rod_Lincoln","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&oldid=565001091","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5910315","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&id=565001091","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Hot+Rod+Lincoln","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Hot+Rod+Lincoln&oldid=565001091&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Hot_Rod_Lincoln&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5910315#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Rod_Lincoln","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org
