In the schematic diagram, the signal\ninto W splits between X and Z, and no signal passes to Y. Similarly, signals\ninto X split to W and Y with none to Z, etc.\n\nCorrect operation requires matched characteristic impedance at all four ports.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Hybrid_coil","recorded":1362543121,"links":18,"instances":["electricity","radio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transformers (electrical)","Telecommunications equipment"],"headings":["Explanation","Applications","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/HybridConjugate.jpg/120px-HybridConjugate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/TwoWireRepeater.jpg/150px-TwoWireRepeater.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5b/DoubleTransformerHybrid.jpg/180px-DoubleTransformerHybrid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a3/SingleTransformerHybrid.jpg/180px-SingleTransformerHybrid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ground","electricity"],["ground","electricity"],["antenna","radio"]],"members":["ground","antenna"],"related":["Transformer","Coil","Electrical_network","Characteristic_impedance","Voiceband","Coil","Two-wire_circuit","Four-wire_circuit","Information_transfer","Four-wire_terminating_set","Repeater","Telephony","Line_card","Transformer","Ground_(electricity)","Balanced_circuit","Two-wire_circuit","Repeater","Ground_(electricity)","Two-wire_circuit","Four-wire_circuit","Balanced_circuit","Telephone","Telephone_hybrid","Sidetone","Impedance_matching","Carbon_microphone","Integrated_circuit","Antenna_(radio)","Hybrid_coupler","Magic_Tee","Rat-race_coupler"]}
