Two molecules of each of the\nfour core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer, around which\napproximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called nucleosomes.\nThe linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and\nfunctions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene\nis intronless and encodes a member of the histone H4 family. Transcripts from\nthis gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination\nelement. This gene is found in the small histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22-\np21.3.
