In many of the body's tissues,\nholocarboxylase synthetase activates other specific enzymes (called biotin-\ndependent carboxylases) by attaching biotin to them. These carboxylases are\ninvolved in many critical cellular functions, including the production and\nbreakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.\n\nHolocarboxylase synthetase may also play a role in regulating the activity of\ngenes. In the nucleus, the enzyme likely attaches biotin molecules to histones,\nwhich are structural proteins that bind to DNA and give chromosomes their shape.\nChanging the shape of histones may help determine whether certain genes are\nturned on or off; however, it is not known how adding biotin affects gene\nregulation.\n\nThe HLCS gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 21 at position 22.1,\nfrom base pair 37,045,059 to base pair 37,284,372.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Holocarboxylase_synthetase","recorded":1362503036,"links":14,"instances":["human"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genes"],"headings":["Related conditions","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chromosome_21","human"]],"members":["chromosome_21"],"related":["Human","Gene","Biotin","Liver","Egg_yolk","Milk","Chromosome_21_(human)","Base_pair","Holocarboxylase_synthetase_deficiency","Mutation","Amino_acid","Carboxylase","Histone","Protein","Fat","Carbohydrate","Biotinylation"]}
