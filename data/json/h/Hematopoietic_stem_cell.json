The definition of hematopoietic stem cells has\nundergone considerable revision in the last two decades. The hematopoietic\ntissue contains cells with long-term and short-term regeneration capacities and\ncommitted multipotent, oligopotent, and unipotent progenitors. HSCs constitute\n1:10.000 of cells in myeloid tissue.\n\nHSCs are a heterogeneous population. Three classes of stem cells exist,\ndistinguished by their ratio of lymphoid to myeloid progeny (L/M) in blood. Myeloid-\nbiased (My-bi) HSC have low L/M ratio (>0, 10). The third category consists of the balanced (Bala)\nHSC for which 3 â¤ L/M â¤ 10. Much work is currently being undertaken to\ninvestigate the properties of these different classes of HSCs, but it appears\nthat only the myeloid-biased and -balanced HSCs have durable self-renewal\nproperties. In addition, serial transplantation experiments have shown that each\nsubtype preferentially re-creates its blood cell type distribution, suggesting\nan inherited epigenetic program for each subtype.\n","linknr":739,"url":"Hematopoietic_stem_cell","recorded":1362512806,"links":37,"instances":["biology","protein","immunology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hematopoietic stem cells","Stem cells","Blood cells","Leukocytes"],"headings":["Source","Functional characteristics","Physical characteristics","Markers","Nomenclature of hematopoietic colonies and lineages","Colony-forming units","HSC repopulation kinetics","See also","References","Additional images","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Blood_cells_differentiation_chart.jpg/250px-Blood_cells_differentiation_chart.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Gray72-en.svg/220px-Gray72-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/1/6f16f2a9319c36e091c325965fccfe39.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Hematopoiesis_%28human%29_diagram.png/120px-Hematopoiesis_%28human%29_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sdf-1","biology"],["cd3","immunology"],["cd5","protein"]],"members":["cd5","cd3"],"related":["Progenitor_cell","Lymphoblast","Lymphocyte","Monoblast","Monocyte","Myeloblast","Promyelocyte","Myelocyte","Metamyelocyte","Neutrophil","Eosinophil","Basophil","Proerythroblast","Basophilic_erythroblast","Polychromatic_erythroblast","Orthochromatic_erythroblast","Erythrocyte","Promegakaryocyte","Megakaryocyte","Platelet","Stem_cell","Myeloid","Monocytes","Macrophages","Neutrophils","Basophils","Eosinophils","Erythrocytes","Megakaryocytes","Platelets","Dendritic_cells","Lymphoid","T-cells","B-cells","NK-cells","Multipotent","Oligopotency","Unipotency","Myeloid_tissue","Bone_marrow","Femur","Ribs","Human_sternum","Cytokine","Umbilical_cord","Peripheral_blood","Aorta-gonad-mesonephros","Bone_marrow_transplantation","Stem_cell_niche","Interleukin_7","Side_population","Transforming_growth_factor","Assay","Feeder_layer","Emperipolesis","Thymocyte","Thymus","Nurse_cell","Nurse-like_cells","Pseudoemperipolesis","Cobblestone","CXCR4","SDF-1_(biology)","Α4β1","Integrin","Bone_marrow_barrier","Thymus","T_cells","Extramedullary_hematopoiesis","Liver","Spleen","Cluster_of_differentiation","CD34","CD38","CD90","CD133","CD105","CD45","C-kit","Stem_cell_factor","Flow_cytometry","CD13","CD33","CD71","CD19","CD61","B220","CD45","B_cells","Integrin_alpha_M","Integrin_alpha_M","CD18","Monocytes","Gr-1","Granulocyte","Ter119","Il7Ra","CD3_(immunology)","CD4","CD5_(protein)","CD8","T_cells","CD34","SCA-1","Thy1","CD38","C-kit","CD34","CD59","CD90","CD38","CD117","CD34","CD38","Severe_combined_immunodeficiency","CD133","CD34","CD34","CD133","Thy1","CD34","Signaling_lymphocyte_activation_molecule","CD48","CD150","CD244","CD150","CD48","CD244","CD150","CD48","CD244","CD150","CD48","CD244","Lin","SCA-1","C-kit","CD34","CD16/32","Lin","SCA-1","C-kit","CD34","CD16/32","Lin","SCA-1","C-kit","CD34","CD16/32","CD150","CD48","CD150","CD48","CD244","CD150","CD48","Thy1","SCA-1","C-kit","Irving_Weissman","Stanford_University","CD135","CD34","CD38","SCA-1","Thy1","C-kit","Lineage_markers","CD135","CD150","CD34","CD38","SCA-1","Thy1","C-kit","Lineage_markers","CD135","CD150","CD11b","CD34","SCA-1","Thy1","C-kit","Lineage_markers","CD135","CD150","CD11b","CD4","CD34","SCA-1","Thy1","C-kit","Lineage_markers","CD135","CD150","CD11b","CD4","Lymphoid","Myeloid","CFU-L","CFU-GEMM","CFU-E","CFU-GM","CFU-G","CFU-GM","CFU-M","CFU-Meg","Lymphocytopoiesis","Erythropoiesis","Granulocytopoiesis","Monocytopoiesis","Thrombocytopoiesis","Lymphoblast","Proerythroblast","Myeloblast","Monoblast","Megakaryoblast","Prolymphocyte","Polychromatophilic_erythrocyte","Promyelocyte","Promonocyte","Promegakaryocyte","Normoblast","Eosinophilic_myelocyte","Neutrophilic_myelocyte","Basophilic_myelocyte","Megakaryocyte","Lymphocyte","Reticulocyte","Metamyelocyte","Band_cell","Early_monocyte","Lymphocyte","Erythrocyte","Granulocytes","Eosinophil","Neutrophil","Basophil","Monocyte","Thrombocytes","Platelets","Lymphocyte","Erythrocyte","Monocyte","Megakaryocyte","Basophil","Eosinophil","Symbolic_dynamics","Hamming_distance","Haematopoiesis","Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation"]}
