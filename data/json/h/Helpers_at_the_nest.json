{"cursor":"5753","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Helpers at the nest' is a term used in behavioural ecology and evolutionary\nbiology to describe a social structure in which juveniles and sexually mature\nadolescents of either one or both sexes, remain in association with their\nparents and help them raise subsequent broods or litters, instead of dispersing\nand beginning to reproduce themselves. This phenomenon was first studied in\nbirds where it occurs most frequently, but it is also known in animals from many\ndifferent groups including mammals and insects. It is a simple form of co-\noperative breeding.\n\nIt occurs in between three and eight percent of bird species worldwide\n(estimates vary), but is much more common in Australia and Southern\nAfrica. Jetz, Walter and Rubenstein, Dustin R.; âEnvironmental Uncertainty\nand the Global Biogeography of Cooperative Breeding in Birdsâ; in Current\nBiology 21, 1â7, January 11, 2011. See also McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B.;\nGlobal Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges; ISBN\n3-923381-27-1 Bird species in which this behaviour is found include the\nCommon Moorhen, the Acorn Woodpecker, and the Apostlebird. The Sugar glider and\nhumans are examples of mammals that exhibit this behaviour. It is also seen in a\nnumber of species of bee such as Carpenter bees (note this is distinct from the\nbehaviour of the European honey bee, where the worker bees are sterile and\nincapable of reproducing).\n\nThe term \"helper\" was coined by Alexander Skutch in 1935 and defined\nmore carefully in 1961 in the avian context as \"a bird which assists in the\nnesting of an individual other than its mate, or feeds or otherwise attends a\nbird of whatever age which is neither its mate nor its dependent offspring.\" The\nterm has been criticised as being anthropomorphic, but continues to remain in\nuse.\n\nThree explanations for the occurrence of helpers at the nest have been put\nforward; they are not mutually exclusive, and in any particular species an\ninvestigation of the exact benefits and costs will be needed to see what\ncombination of these factors may have driven the evolution of\nhelping.

Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-53099-\n6 *Advantage to the helpers, who may be protected from predation, or gain\nskills that they will need when they subsequently reproduce, as a result of\nstaying in the parental nest. *Kin selection: since subsequent litters or\nbroods from the same parents will be full siblings to the helpers, they are as\nclosely related genetically as their own offspring would be. Helping their\nparents is therefore as productive for the juveniles as reproducing themselves\nwould be, and if their parents are better able to reproduce, the balance of\nadvantage may be greater. *Delayed advantage to the helpers, in particular\nbecause they stand to inherit their parents' territory; this explanation is\nparticularly compelling if suitable territories are in short supply, but\nrequires specific quantitative conditions to be met, favouring a stable queue\nof potential heirs. Wiley, R. H.; Rabenold, K. N. (1984). \"The evolution of\ncooperative breeding by delayed reciprocity and queuing for favorable social\npositions\". Evolution 38:609-621\n\nAlthough it is frequently assumed that helpers are non-breeders, molecular\nevidence suggests that this may happen, and the term \"secondary helper\" is\nsometimes used in this case to indicate helpers that mate with or are not\nrelated offspring of the pair being assisted. The term \"primary helper\" being\nused for the commoner case of the helper being offspring of the pair and not\ninvolved in mating. Ligon, J. D.; Burt, D. B. (2004) \"Evolutionary origins\"\nin Ecology and evolution of cooperative breeding in birds by Walter D. Koenig,\nJanis L. Dickinson. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 978-0-521-53099-6\nExtrapair mates are chosen by the females and are these then contribute to the\ncare of the young who may be sired by them.\n\nJuveniles living in association with their parents cannot automatically be\nregarded as helpers. In a number of species, such as the logrunners Frith,\nC.B., Frith, D.W. & Jansen, A. 1997. âThe nesting biology of the Chowchilla\nOrthonyx spaldingii (Orthonychidae)â; [[Emu (journal)|Emu]] 97, 18-30. and\nthe Siberian Jay, young remain in the parental territory, but never help feed\nnestlings. However the delayed advantage explanation for the juveniles'\nassociation with their parents can still work in the absence of effective\nhelping, whereas the kin selection explanation cannot.\n","linknr":129,"url":"Helpers_at_the_nest","recorded":1363435300,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Alloparenting","/wiki/Behavioural_ecology","/wiki/Evolutionary_biology","/wiki/Juvenile_(organism)","/wiki/Sexually_mature","/wiki/Adolescent","/wiki/Offspring","/wiki/Litter","/wiki/Bird","/wiki/Mammal","/wiki/Insect","/wiki/Co-operative_breeding","/wiki/Species","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Southern_Africa","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Common_Moorhen","/wiki/Acorn_Woodpecker","/wiki/Apostlebird","/wiki/Sugar_glider","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Human","/wiki/Carpenter_bee","/wiki/European_honey_bee","/wiki/Alexander_Skutch","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Anthropomorphic","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Kin_selection","/wiki/Territory_(animal)","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Orthonychidae","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Siberian_Jay","/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/3923381271","#cite_ref-2","http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v052n03/p0257-p0273.pdf","http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v052n03/p0257-p0273.pdf","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1146%2Fannurev.es.09.110178.001011","#cite_ref-4","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780521530996","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780521530996","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/Digital_object_identifier","http://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frspb.2007.0424","#cite_ref-8","/wiki/Emu_(journal)","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&oldid=543529828","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Behavioral_ecology","/wiki/Category:Ethology","/wiki/Category:Ornithological_terminology","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_August_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Helpers+at+the+nest&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Helpers+at+the+nest","/wiki/Helpers_at_the_nest","/wiki/Talk:Helpers_at_the_nest","#","/wiki/Helpers_at_the_nest","/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Helpers_at_the_nest","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Helpers_at_the_nest","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&oldid=543529828","/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Helpers_at_the_nest&id=543529828","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Helpers+at+the+nest","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Helpers+at+the+nest&oldid=543529828&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Helpers_at_the_nest&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col%C2%B7laboradors_al_niu","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestohelpanto","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Helpers
