{"cursor":"28805","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a flightless bird of Mauritius, became extinct during the mid-late seventeenth\ncentury after humans destroyed the forests where the birds made their homes and\nintroduced mammals that ate their eggs.]] The 'Holocene extinction', sometimes\ncalled the 'Sixth Extinction', is a name proposed to describe\nthe extinction event of species that has occurred during the present Holocene\nepoch (since around 10,000 BC). The large number of extinctions span numerous\nfamilies of plants and animals including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles\nand arthropods. Although 875 extinctions occurring between 1500 and 2009 have\nbeen documented by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and\nNatural Resources, the vast majority are undocumented. According to\nthe species-area theory and based on upper-bound estimating, the present rate of\nextinction may be up to 140,000 species per year. S.L. Pimm, G.J. Russell,\nJ.L. Gittleman and T.M. Brooks, The Future of Biodiversity, Science 269: 347â350\n(1995)\n\nThe Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large mammals known as\nmegafauna, starting between 9,000 and 13,000 years ago, the end of the last Ice\nAge. Such disappearances are considered to be results of both climate change and\nthe proliferation of modern humans. These extinctions, occurring near the\nPleistoceneâHolocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the Quaternary\nextinction event. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century.\n\nThere is no general agreement on whether to consider more recent extinctions as\na distinct event, merely part of the Quaternary extinction event, or just a\nresult of natural evolution on a non-geologic scale of time. Only during these\nmost recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses.\nOverall, the Holocene extinction can be characterised by humanity's presence.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Holocene_extinction_event","recorded":1372152347,"links":[],"instances":["journal","geology","ecology","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Holocene extinctions|","Extinction","Holocene","Humans","Environmental impact by effect"],"headings":["Prehistoric extinctions","Ongoing Holocene extinction","Human influence on extinction","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["epoch","geology"],["science","journal"],["endemic","ecology"],["transmission","medicine"],["epoch","geology"],["science","journal"],["science","journal"],["science","journal"]],"members":["science","epoch","endemic","transmission"],"related":["Bird","Mauritius","Humans","Forest","Extinction_event","Species","Holocene","Epoch_(geology)","Plant","Animal","Mammal","Bird","Amphibian","Reptile","Arthropod","International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature_and_Natural_Resources","Species-area_curve","Science_(journal)","Mammal","Megafauna","Last_Ice_Age","Climate_change","Overpopulation","Modern_human","Pleistocene","Quaternary_extinction_event","Quaternary_extinction_event","Plant","Human_impact_on_the_environment","Megafauna","Glacial_period","Settlement_of_the_Americas","Mammoths","Industrial_revolution","Glacial_period","Woolly_mammoth","Clovis_people","Polynesia","Moa","Ratite","Haast's_Eagle","Adzebill","Archeology","Paleontology","Bismarck_Archipelago","Solomon_Islands","Moa-nalo","Hawaii","Nēnē-nui","Megapode","New_Caledonia","Mekosuchine_crocodiles","Fiji","Samoa","Elephant_Bird","Ratite","Subfossil_lemur","Giant_Aye-aye","Sloth_lemur","Koala_lemur","Monkey_lemur","Baboon","Macaque","Ruffed_lemur","Giant_Fossa","Malagasy_Hippopotamus","Giant_tortoise","Seychelles","Mascarene_Islands","List_of_extinct_birds","Dodo","Rodrigues_Solitaire","Réunion_Sacred_Ibis","Background_extinction_rate","Oxford_University_Press","Stuart_Pimm","Père_David's_Deer","Giant_Panda","Sumatran_Rhinoceros","Black-Footed_Ferret","Arthropod","Aurochs","Equus_ferus_ferus","Thylacine","Quagga","Steller's_Sea_Cow","Bluebuck","Pyrenean_Ibex","Falkland_Islands_Wolf","Atlas_Bear","Caribbean_Monk_Seal","Bali_Tiger","Javan_Tiger","Eastern_Cougar","Western_Black_Rhinoceros","Endemic_(ecology)","List_of_extinct_birds","Dodo","Pigeon","Mauritius","Indian_Ocean","Great_Auk","Passenger_Pigeon","Moa","Carolina_Parakeet","American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","El_Niño","Convention_on_Biological_Diversity","Biodiversity_Action_Plan","Endangered_species","USA_Today","LA_Times","Reuters","Scientific_American","Pleistocene","Human_overpopulation","Greenhouse_gas","Overfishing","Deforestation","Hunting","Pollution","Introduced_species","Globalization_and_disease","Transmission_(medicine)","Infectious_disease","Anthropocene","E.O._Wilson","Earth","American_Museum_of_Natural_History","MSNBC","IUCN","Red_List","Nomenclature","Anthropocene","Holocene","Epoch_(geology)","Industrial_revolution","Megafauna","Late_Pleistocene","Smithsonian_Institution_Press","Geological_Society_of_America","Yale_University_Press","Biodiversity","Effects_of_global_warming","Extinction_risk_from_global_warming","List_of_extinct_animals","List_of_extinct_plants","Timeline_of_extinctions","Postmedia_News","Science_(journal)","The_Christian_Science_Monitor","Science_(journal)","Science_(journal)"]}
