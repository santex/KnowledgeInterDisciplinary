Harmonic frequencies are\nequally spaced by the width of the fundamental frequency and can be found by\nrepeatedly adding that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency\n(first harmonic) is 25 Hz, the frequencies of the next harmonics are: 50&nbsp;Hz\n(2nd harmonic), 75&nbsp;Hz (3rd harmonic), 100&nbsp;Hz (4th harmonic) etc.\n","title":"harmonic","headings":["Characteristics","Harmonics and overtones","Harmonics on stringed instruments","Other information","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Timbre","2: Fundamental_frequency","2: Octave","2: Ogg","1: Wave","1: Frequency","1: Integer","1: Hertz","1: Oscillator","1: Human_voice","1: Violin","1: Cepheid_variable_star","1: Periodic_function","1: Inharmonicity","1: Cymbals","1: Piano","1: Pizzicato","1: Singing_bowl","1: Multiphonics","1: Overtone","1: Music","1: Fundamental_tone","1: Musical_instruments","1: Wind_instruments","1: Extended_technique","1: Multiphonic","1: String_instruments","1: Unison","1: Cello","1: Overtone_singing","1: Guitar","1: Guitar_harmonics","1: Orchestration","1: Stop_note","1: Perfect_fifth","1: Just_major_third","1: Minor_third","1: Harmonic_seventh","1: Septimal_major_second","1: Pythagorean_interval","1: Whole_tone","1: Neutral_second","1: Tritone","1: Neutral_sixth","1: Septimal_minor_third","1: Diatonic_semitone","1: Major_seventh","1: Just_intonation","1: Arnold_Dreyblatt","1: Double_bass","1: Lawrence_Ball","1: Aristoxenus","1: Artificial_harmonic","1: Electronic_tuner","1: Formant","1: Fourier_series","1: Harmonic_oscillator","1: Harmony","1: Pinch_harmonic","1: Pure_tone","1: Pythagorean_tuning","1: Scale_of_harmonics","1: Spherical_harmonics","1: Stretched_octave","1: Subharmonic","1: Tap_harmonic","1: Xenharmonic","1: Sciarrino"]}
