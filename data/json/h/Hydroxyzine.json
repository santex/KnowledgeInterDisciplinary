It was first\nsynthesized by Union Chimique Belge in 1956 and was marketed by Pfizer in the\nUnited States later the same year, and is\nstill in widespread use today.\n\nDue to its antagonistic effects on several receptor systems in the brain,\nhydroxyzine has strong anxiolytic and mild antiobsessive as well as\nantipsychotic properties. Schram, WS: \"Use of hydroxyzine in psychosis\".\nDis Nerv Syst 20:126 (1959) Today it is used primarily for the\nsymptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and\nas an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested.\nBecause of its antihistamine effects it can also be used for the treatment of\nsevere cases of itching, hyperalgesia and motion sickness-induced\nnausea. FDA DrugInfo: http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDr-\nugInfo.cfm?archiveid=51459 Even though it is an effective sedative,\nhypnotic, analgesic, and tranquilizer, it allegedly shares virtually none of\nthe abuse, dependence, addiction, and toxicity potential of other drugs used\nfor the same range of therapeutic reasons.\n\nHydroxyzine has been used in medical practice with opioid analgesics to increase\nthe analgesic efficacy of opioids, and by recreational drug users to maximise\nthe effects of opiates, and/or preempt some side effects of opioids like\nitching, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nHydroxyzine preparations usually require a doctor's prescription. The drug is\navailable in two formulations, the pamoate and the dihydrochloride or\nhydrochloride salts. 'Vistaril', 'Equipose', 'Masmoran', and 'Paxistil' are\npreparations of the pamoate salt, while 'Atarax', 'Alamon', 'Aterax', 'Durrax',\n'Tran-Q', 'Orgatrax', 'Quiess', and 'Tranquizine' are of the hydrochloride salt.\n\nOther drugs related to hydroxyzine are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and\nthey share all or most of the benefits, indications, contraindications,\ncautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine. The second-generation antihistamine\ncetirizine is in fact one of the metabolites of hydroxyzine produced in the\nhuman body. Unlike Hydroxyzine, cetirizine is not able to cross the blood-brain-\nbarrier. Therefore it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective\nantihistamine but removing some or all of the anxiolytic and analgesic-sparing\nproperties.\n","linknr":3898,"url":"Hydroxyzine","recorded":1362552666,"links":57,"instances":["biochemistry","pharmacology","pharmacology"],"pdf":["http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n11/v63n1112.pdf","http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n11/v63n1112.pdf","http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_vistaril.pdf","http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/rld/11795s16.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/rld/11795s16.pdf","http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_vistaril.pdf","http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_vistaril.pdf"],"categories":["Analgesics","Antiemetics","Anxiolytics","H1 receptor antagonists","Muscarinic antagonists","Sedatives","Piperazines","Organochlorides","Ethers","Alcohols","Belgian inventions"],"headings":["Prescription and use","Clinical description","Pharmacology","Chemistry","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Hydroxyzine.svg/220px-Hydroxyzine.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Hydroxyzine-3d-sticks.png/220px-Hydroxyzine-3d-sticks.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Hydroxyzine_synthesis.png/500px-Hydroxyzine_synthesis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["potency","pharmacology"],["affinity","pharmacology"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","affinity","potency"],"related":["Mouth","Intramuscular_injection","In_vivo","Renal","Urine","Feces","First-generation_antihistamine","Diphenylmethane","Piperazine","Union_Chimique_Belge","Pfizer","United_States","Receptor_antagonist","Obsessive–compulsive_disorder","Antipsychotic","Psychoneurosis","Anxiety","Antihistamine","Itch","Hyperalgesia","Motion_sickness","Nausea","Sedative","Hypnotic","Analgesic","Tranquilizer","Drug_abuse","Drug_dependence","Drug_addiction","Toxicity","Drug_form","Physician","Medical_prescription","Formulation","Pamoate","Dihydrochloride","Hydrochloride","Salt","Cyclizine","Buclizine","Meclizine","Cetirizine","Metabolite","Blood-brain-barrier","Antihistamine","Anxiolytic","Tranquilizer","General_anxiety_disorder","Neurosis","Benzodiazepine","Bromazepam","Allergy","Urticaria","Atopic_dermatitis","Contact_dermatitis","Histamine","Pruritus","Premedication","Atropine","Pethidine","Barbiturate","Benzodiazepines","Scopolamine","Learned_helplessness","Pharmacokinetics","Cetirizine","Dialysis","Food_and_drug_administration","Hypersensitivity","Tardive_dyskinesia","Athetoid","Phenothiazine","Tinnitus","Gastro-intestinal","Antimuscarinic","Formatio_reticularis","Central_nervous_system","Lithium_pharmacology","Alcohol","Lorazepam","Somnolence","Anxiolytic","Sedative","Sleep_onset_latency","Alprazolam","Diazepam","Mechanism_of_action","Potency_(pharmacology)","H1_receptor","Inverse_agonist","Affinity_(pharmacology)","Muscarinic_acetylcholine_receptor","Anticholinergic","5-HT2A_receptor","D2_receptor","Alpha-1_adrenergic","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Receptor_antagonist","Antiserotonergic"]}
