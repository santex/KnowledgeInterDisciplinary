It is used to\nmanage frequently-updated Web content. With a little tweaking (mainly to skins),\nit might be considered http://www.mitchelaneous.com/2008/12/05/wordpress-suck-try-\nnucleus-cms/ a lightweight content management system. http://cmsreport.com/category/nucleus-\ncms\n\nNucleus makes use of a callback function which has led to a plugin system that\nhas inspired somewhere in the order of 50 to 100 distinct\nplugins. http://wakka.xiffy.nl/plugin The general drive within the\ndevelopment community is that functionality should exist as plugins as totally\nas possible. This philosophy has led to a relatively light and uncluttered\nbase install.\n\nNucleus is included in Fantastico, available via many domains' cPanel as well as\nvia a number of \"easy install\" services such as Simple Scripts. http://www.-\nsimplescripts.com/script_details/install:NucleusCMS\n","linknr":213,"url":"Nucleus_CMS","recorded":1362685296,"links":17,"instances":["computer_programming","web_hosting"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Free content management systems","Free software programmed in PHP","Blog software","2001 software"],"headings":["History","Development Community","Methodologies","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg/28px-Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fantastico","web_hosting"],["callback","computer_programming"]],"members":["callback","fantastico"],"related":["PHP","Blog","GNU_General_Public_License","Open-source","Blog","PHP","MySQL","Wouter_Demuynck","Content_management_system","Callback_function","Fantastico_(web_hosting)","CPanel","Blogger.com","JavaScript","Movable_Type","PMachine","Pivotlog","XML","MySQL","Open_Source_CMS","Callback_(computer_programming)","Web_template","API","XML-RPC","Movable_Type","MetaWeblog","Blogger.com","XML-RPC","XML-RPC_for_PHP","Useful_Inc","PhpBB","List_of_content_management_systems"]}
