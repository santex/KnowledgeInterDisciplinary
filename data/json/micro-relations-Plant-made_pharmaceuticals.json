{"cursor":"36858","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":For pharming in [[internet]], see [[pharming]]. For pharming in drug abuse, see\n[[pharming parties]].\n\n'Pharming' is a portmanteau of farming and \"pharmaceutical\" and refers to the\nuse of genetic engineering to insert genes that code for useful pharmaceuticals\ninto host animals or plants that would otherwise not express those genes, thus\ncreating a genetically modified organism (GMO). Pharming is also known as 'molecular farming', 'molecular\npharming' or 'biopharming'.\n\nThe products of pharming are recombinant proteins or their metabolic products.\nRecombinant proteins are most commonly produced using bacteria or yeast in a\nbioreactor, but pharming offers the advantage to the producer that it does not\nrequire expensive infrastructure, and production capacity can be quickly scaled\nto meet demand, at greatly reduced cost.
