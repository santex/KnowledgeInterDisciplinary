The more distant\n parts of the far-field are identified with classical electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe basic reason an EM field changes in character with distance from its source\nis that Maxwell's equations prescribe different behaviors for each of the two\nsource-terms of electric fields and also the two source-terms for magnetic\nfields. Electric fields produced by charge distributions have a different\ncharacter than those produced by changing magnetic fields. Similarly, Maxwell's\nequations show a differing behavior for the magnetic fields produced by\n[[electric current]]s, versus magnetic fields produced by changing electric\nfields. For these reasons, in the region very close to currents and charge-\nseparations, the EM field is dominated by electric and magnetic components\nproduced directly by currents and charge-separations, and these effects together\nproduce the EM \"near field.\" However, at distances far from charge-separations\nand currents, the EM field becomes dominated by the electric and magnetic fields\nindirectly produced by the change in the other type of field, and thus the EM\nfield is no longer affected (or much affected) by the charges and currents at\nthe EM source. This more distant part of the EM field is the \"radiative\" field\nor \"far-field,\" and it is the familiar type of electromagnetic radiation seen in\n\"free space,\" far from any EM field sources (origins).\n\nThe far-field thus includes radio waves and microwaves several wavelengths from\nmost types of antennas, as well as all the shorter-wave EM radiation in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum (infrared, light, UV, X-rays, etc.). The latter types\nof EM radiation in normal experience show far-field behavior almost exclusively,\ndue to their shorter wavelength that gives them a \"far-field\" character at all\nbut extremely short distances from their sources. For example, visible light\nshows far-field behavior at all distances larger than one micrometer from its\nsource. The wavelengths of visible light is in the range 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers,\nso the near field for light is in the expected range.\n\nIn practical mathematical terms, the dominance of far-field behavior with\nsufficient distance from the source appears because both currents and the\noscillating charge-distributions in antennas (and other radiators) produce\n'[[dipole]]' type field behavior. While these dipole near-field intensities may\nbe very powerful near the source, they decay very rapidly with distance in\ncomparison to EM radiation (the far-field). Radiative far-field intensity decays\nmore slowly with distance, following the inverse square law for total EM power\nthat is typical of all electromagnetic radiation. For this reason, the far-field\ncomponent of the EM field wins out in intensity with increasing distance. Thus,\nfor objects such as transmitting antennas, electrical or electronic equipment,\ndielectric materials, or where radiation is scattering from an object, the non-\nradiative 'near field' components of electromagnetic fields dominate the EM\nfield close to the object, while electromagnetic radiation or 'far field'\nbehaviors dominate at greater distances. The near-field does not suddenly end\nwhere the far-field beginsârather, there is a transition zone between these\ntypes where both types of EM field-effects may be significant.\n","linknr":297,"url":"Near_and_far_field","recorded":1362890168,"links":20,"instances":["electromagnetism","waves","waves","physics","physics","radio"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antennas","Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics)"],"headings":["Regions and their cause","Definitions","Near-field characteristics","Classical EM modelling","Quantum field theory view","See also","References","Patents"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg/300px-FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Field_regions_for_typical_antennas_vector.svg/494px-Field_regions_for_typical_antennas_vector.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/8/36807062748a45c2c2608b54b75c53da.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/e/e/fee9544e309180104a85e90d76d24161.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/8/5/585e0bf65262507873438c914ab1f2cc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/FarNearFields-USP-4998112.svg/494px-FarNearFields-USP-4998112.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg/300px-FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/FarNearFields-USP-4998112-2.svg/300px-FarNearFields-USP-4998112-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/a/bfa59387d0713597da45ab4d5af66f77.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/3/5/c3554657eba018d507d1201a753e0e8b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/6/0/d60f58b88eba40847c006a29d34a1a2a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/a/a3a61ed9180c73cd339984388c193e2c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["antenna","radio"],["field","physics"],["antenna","radio"],["field","physics"],["antenna","radio"],["polarization","waves"],["phase","waves"],["homogeneity","physics"],["reciprocity","electromagnetism"]],"members":["reciprocity","phase","polarization","homogeneity","field","antenna"],"related":["Fresnel_diffraction","Electromagnetic_field","Electromagnetic_radiation","Maxwell's_equations","Electric_field","Magnetic_fields","Electromagnetic_radiation","Micrometer","Antenna_(radio)","Electromagnetic_radiation","Wavelength","Electromagnetic_induction","Transformer","Magnetic_monopole","Electric_field","Field_(physics)","Free_space","Near-field_communication","Telecommunications","Antenna_(radio)","Field_(physics)","Optical_fiber","Telecommunication","Aperture","Radio_frequency","Wavelength","Fraunhofer_distance","Joseph_von_Fraunhofer","Radiator","Diameter","Antenna_(radio)","Wavelength","Wave","Light_beam","Electromagnetic_radiation","Electric_field","Magnetic_field","Diffraction","Electromagnetic_wave","Polarization_(waves)","Rules_of_thumb","Fresnel_diffraction","Power_density","Phase_(waves)","Energy","Electrostatic","Self-capacitance","Electromagnetic_induction","Electromagnetic_induction","Transformer","Transformer","Metal_detector","Inductive_coupling","Maxwell's_equations","Electric_field","Magnetic_field","Vacuum","Air","Homogeneity_(physics)","Isotropic","Transmission_medium","Multipole_expansion","Spherical_harmonic","Spherical_Bessel_function","Evanescent_field","Electrical_conductor","Radio","Aperture","Microwave","Optical_device","Antenna_pattern","Reciprocity_(electromagnetism)","Fourier_transform","Hankel_transform","Impedance_of_free_space","Speed_of_light","Free_space","Virtual_particle","Fresnel_diffraction","Fraunhofer_diffraction","Near_field_communication","Near-field_magnetic_induction_communication","RFID","Resonant_inductive_coupling","Wireless_energy_transfer","MRI_scanner","Antenna_measurement","Fraunhofer_distance","Ground_wave","Sky_wave","Inverse-square_law","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration"]}
