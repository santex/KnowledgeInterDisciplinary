Uncovering the molecular secret of the gene in question â that for the\ncapsular polysaccharide of pneumococcal bacteria â led the way to studying\nheredity not only through genetics but also through chemistry, and initiated the\ndawn of the age of molecular biology. McCarty was the youngest and longest\nsurviving member of the research team responsible for this feat (known as the\nAvery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment), which also included Oswald T. Avery and Colin\nMacLeod; he died on January 2, 2005, from congestive heart failure.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Maclyn_McCarty","recorded":1362374062,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1911 births","2005 deaths","American geneticists","Molecular biologists","Wolf Prize in Medicine laureates","Rockefeller University people"],"headings":["Life","References","Source","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Maclyn_McCarty_with_Francis_Crick_and_James_D_Watson_-_10.1371_journal.pbio.0030341.g001-O.jpg/220px-Maclyn_McCarty_with_Francis_Crick_and_James_D_Watson_-_10.1371_journal.pbio.0030341.g001-O.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["DNA","Gene","South_Bend,_Indiana","United_States","Geneticist","DNA","Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment","Oswald_T._Avery","Colin_MacLeod","South_Bend,_Indiana","Johns_Hopkins_University","Stanford_University","Biochemistry","New_York_University","United_States_National_Research_Council","Rockefeller_University","Frederick_Griffith","Streptococcus_pneumoniae","Genotype","Phenotype","Serotype","Protein","Nucleic_acid","RNA","DNA","Journal_of_Experimental_Medicine","Oligonucleotides","Streptococci","Rheumatic_fever","Rebecca_Lancefield","Streptococcal_pharyngitis","Electron_microscope","Polysaccharide","Peptidoglycan","Hexosamine","Antigen","Helen_Hay_Whitney_Foundation","Institute_of_Medicine","Journal_of_Experimental_Medicine","United_States","Geneticist","South_Bend,_Indiana"]}
