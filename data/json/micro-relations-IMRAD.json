{"cursor":"8916","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'IMRAD' structure is the most prominent norm for the structure of a\nscientific paper. 'IMRAD' is an acronym for 'I'ntroduction, 'M'ethods, 'R'esults\n'a'nd 'D'iscussion. Scientific papers are typically structured in this basic\norder: *'Introduction' - Why was the study undertaken? What was the research\nquestion, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research? *'Methods' -\nWhen, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was\nincluded in the study groups (patients, etc.)? *'Results' - What answer was\nfound to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested\nhypothesis true? *'and' *'Discussion' - What might the answer infer and why does\nit matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are\nthe perspectives for future research?\n\nThis particular format of scientific writing has been adopted by a steadily\nincreasing number of academic journals since the first half of the last century.\nThe IMRAD structure has come to dominate academic writing in the sciences, most\nnotably in empirical biomedicine. Although the\nIMRAD structure originates in the empirical sciences, it now also regularly\nappears in academic journals across a wide range of disciplines. Many scientific\njournals now not only prefer this structure, but also use the IMRaD acronym as\nan instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the\nuse of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly\nrecommended in the \"Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical\nJournals\" issued by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors\n(previously called the [[Vancouver guidelines]]):  The text of\nobservational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) divided\ninto the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.\nThis so-called âIMRADâ structure is not an arbitrary publication format but\nrather a direct reflection of the process of scientific discovery. Long articles\nmay need subheadings within some sections (especially Results and Discussion) to\nclarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case reports, reviews,\nand editorials, probably need to be formatted\ndifferently. The IMRAD structure is also recommended for\nempirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the American\nPsychological Association (APA style). The APA publication manual is\nwidely used by journals in the social, educational and behavioral sciences.\n\nThe IMRAD structure has proved successful because it facilitates literature\nreview, allowing readers to navigate articles more quickly to locate material\nrelevant to their purpose. But the neat order of IMRAD rarely\ncorresponds to the actual sequence of events or ideas of the research\npresented; the IMRAD structure effectively supports a reordering that\neliminates unnecessary detail, and allow the reader to assess a well-ordered\nand noise free presentation of the relevant and significant information. It\nallows the most relevant information to be presented clearly and logically to\nthe readership, by summarizing the research process in an ideal sequence and\nwithout unnecessary detail.\n\nThe idealised sequence of the IMRAD structure has on occasion been criticised\nfor being too rigid and simplistic. In a radio talk in 1964 the Nobel laureate\nPeter Medawar even criticised this instructive text structure for not giving a\nrealistic representation of the thought processes of the writing scientist: \"...\nthe scientific paper paper may be a fraud because it misrepresents the processes\nof thought that accompanied or gave rise to the work that is described in the\npaper\". Medawar's criticism was discussed at the XIXth General\nAssembly of the World Medical Association in 1965.\n\nIt seems that neither the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors nor\nPeter Medawar even considered that it may be a bit too much to ask from such a\nsimple instruction device to carry the burden of representing the entire process\nof scientific discovery. They both, however, give eloquent testimony both to the\nimportance and to the limitations of the device.\n\nIn addition to the scientific article itself a brief abstract is usually\nrequired for publication. The abstract should, however, be composed to function\nas an autonomous text, even if some authors and readers may think of it as an\nalmost integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed\nautonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the increasing use of\nsearchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will\ndramatically increase the probability for an article to be found by its optimal\nreadership. Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward\ndeveloping formal requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD\npattern, and often with strict additional specifications of topical content\nitems that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract. Such\nabstracts are often referred to as \"structured abstracts\".\n","linknr":167,"url":"IMRAD","recorded":1362570879,"links":24,"instances":["summary"],"pdf":["http://www.amwa.org/default/publications/journal/scanned/v04.2.pdf","http://www.amwa.org/default/publications/journal/scanned/v04.2.pdf","http://www.icmje.org/urm_full.pdf","http://www.icmje.org/urm_full.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/868.full.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/868.full.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/870.full.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/2/5466/870.full.pdf"],"categories":["Medical research","Academic literature","Scientific documents","Technical communication","Style guides for technical and scientific writing"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["abstract","summary"]],"members":["abstract"],"related":["Scientific_papers","Acronym","Scientific_papers","Research_question","Hypothesis","Empirical","Academic_journals","Academic_disciplines","Scientific_journals","Uniform_Requirements_for_Manuscripts_Submitted_to_Biomedical_Journals","International_Committee_of_Medical_Journal_Editors","American_Psychological_Association","APA_style","Social_science","Educational_research","Behavioral_science","List_of_Nobel_laureates","Peter_Medawar","World_Medical_Association","International_Committee_of_Medical_Journal_Editors","Peter_Medawar","Abstract_(summary)","EASE_Guidelines_for_Authors_and_Translators_of_Scientific_Articles"]}
