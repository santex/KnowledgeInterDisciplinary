The cells produced by meiosis are gametes or spores.\nIn many organisms, including all animals and land plants (but not some other\ngroups such as fungi), gametes are called sperm and egg cells.\n\nWhilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the 'life-\ncycle' cell division process of mitosis, it differs in two important respects:\n\n* the chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes\n  producing a different genetic combination in each gamete, compared with the\n  co-existence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome (one\n  received from each parent) in each cell which results from mitosis.\n\n* the outcome of meiosis is potentially four (genetically unique) haploid\n  cells, compared with the two (genetically identical) diploid cells produced\n  from mitosis.\n\nMeiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each\nchromosomeâone from the organism's mother and one from its father. The cell\ndivides twice, potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one\ncopy of each chromosome. (\"Potentially\" because in some cases, such as the\nformation of oocytes in mammals, only one of the possible four haploid cells\nsurvives.) In animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or\nfemale gamete. Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a\nunique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA, resulting in offspring that are\ngenetically distinct from either parent. This gives rise to genetic diversity\nin sexually reproducing populations. This genetic diversity can provide the\nvariation of physical and behavioural attributes (phenotypes) upon which\nnatural selection can act, but, as described below in Section 6, Origin and\nfunction of meiosis, the genetic diversity may be largely a by-product of the\nhomologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function\nduring meiosis.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that during meiosis, specific genes are more highly\ntranscribed, and these are called the 'meiome', the term used in functional\ngenomics for the meiotic transcriptome. http://www.horticulture.umn.edu/Cha-\nngbin_Chen.html http://www.agwine.adelaide.edu.au/plant/pbg/gm/\nMeiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which\nhomologous chromosome pairing, synapse and recombination occur. In addition to\nstrong meiotic stage-specific expression of mRNA (the meiome), however, there\nare also pervasive translational controls (e.g. selective usage of preformed\nmRNA), regulating the ultimate meiotic stage-specific protein expression of\ngenes during meiosis. Thus, both the meiome and\ntranslational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed\nto carry out meiosis.\n\nPrior to the meiosis process the cell's chromosomes are duplicated by a round of\nDNA replication, creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each\nchromosome (homologs) two exact copies, sister chromatids, attached at the\ncentromere region. In the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal\nhomologs pair to each other. Then they typically exchange parts by homologous\nrecombination leading to crossovers of DNA between the maternal and paternal\nversions of the chromosome. Spindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair\nof homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equator. Then the fibers pull\nthe recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cell. As the chromosomes move\naway from the center the cell divides into two daughter cells, each containing a\nhaploid number of chromosomes composed of two chromatids.\n\nAfter the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two\ndaughter cells, a second round of cell division occurs. There meiosis ends as\nthe two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one\nof the four resulting gamete cells. Upon fertilization, for example when a sperm\nenters an egg cell, two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuse. The gamete from\nthe mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half of the set of\nchromosomes that make up the new offspring's genome.\n\nMeiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis, a type of cell division\nused by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical\ndaughter cells. In all plants and in many protists meiosis results in the\nformation of spores: haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without\nundergoing fertilization. Some eukaryotes, like Bdelloid rotifers, do not have\nthe ability to carry out meiosis and have acquired the ability to reproduce by\nparthenogenesis. Meiosis does not occur in archaea or bacteria, which generally\nreproduce via asexual processes such as binary fission. However, a similar\n\"sexual\" process, known as bacterial transformation, involves transfer of DNA\nfrom one bacterium to another and recombination of these DNA molecules of\ndifferent parental origin.\n","linknr":714,"url":"Meiosis","recorded":1362483555,"links":74,"instances":["biology","genetics","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular processes","Cell cycle","Molecular genetics"],"headings":["History","Occurrence in eukaryotic life cycles","Process","Phases","Origin and function","Meiosis facilitates stable sexual reproduction","Nondisjunction","Meiosis in mammals","Meiosis in plants and animals","Meiosis vs. mitosis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Meiosis_Overview.svg/300px-Meiosis_Overview.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg/11px-Speakerlink-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Gametic_meiosis.png/350px-Gametic_meiosis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Zygotic_meiosis.png/350px-Zygotic_meiosis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/MitosisAndMeiosis_en.png/330px-MitosisAndMeiosis_en.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Meiosis_diagram.jpg/300px-Meiosis_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["chiasma","genetics"],["chiasma","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["synizesis","biology"]],"members":["synizesis","chiasma","transcription","egg"],"related":["Cell_division","Sexual_reproduction","Eukaryote","Gamete","Spore","Animal","Embryophyte","Fungi","Sperm","Ovum","Mitosis","Genetic_recombination","Haploid","Chromosome","Oocyte","Gamete","Genetic_diversity","Phenotype","Natural_selection","Homologous_recombination","Functional_genomics","Transcriptome","Eukaryote","Homologous_chromosome","MRNA","DNA_replication","Homologous_chromosome","Sister_chromatids","Centromere","Homologous_recombination","Chromosomal_crossover","Spindle_apparatus","Fertilization","Genome","Mitosis","Eukaryote","Protist","Spore","Bdelloid_rotifers","Parthenogenesis","Archaea","Bacteria","Binary_fission","Sea_urchin","Egg_(biology)","Oscar_Hertwig","Chromosome","Edouard_Van_Beneden","August_Weismann","United_States","Thomas_Hunt_Morgan","Chromosomal_crossover","Sexual_reproduction","Mitosis","Germ_cell","Somatic_cell","Death","Zygote","Spermatozoa","Ovum","Mitosis","Gamete","Mitosis","Fungus","Protozoa","Alternation_of_generations","Cell_cycle","Interphase","Centromere","Chromatid","Homologous_chromosome","Chromatid","Prophase","Metaphase","Anaphase","Telophase","Homologous_chromosomes","Homologous_recombination","Chromosomal_crossover","Genetic_variation","Alleles","Chromatids","Homologous_chromosomes","Synapsis","Chiasma_(genetics)","Synaptonemal_complex","Synaptonemal_complex","Chromosomal_crossover","Sex_chromosomes","Chiasma_(genetics)","Synaptonemal_complex","Transcription_(genetics)","Oogenesis","Dictyotene","Puberty","Prometaphase","Nucleoli","Nuclear_membrane","Spindle_apparatus","Centrosomes","Centrioles","Microtubule","Kinetochore","Interkinesis","Nuclear_envelope","Ploidy","Polyploidy","Klinefelter's_syndrome","Trisomy","Monosomy","Mitosis","Down_Syndrome","Patau_Syndrome","Edward_Syndrome","Klinefelter_Syndrome","Turner_Syndrome","Triple_X_syndrome","XYY_syndrome","Oogonia","Ovarian_follicle","Folliculogenesis","Menstrual_cycle","Oogenesis","Dictyate","Centrosomes","Spermatogenesis","Seminiferous_tubule","Testicles","Spermatocytes","Spermatozoa","Female_mammals","Protist","Mitotic_crossover","Coefficient_of_coincidence","DNA_repair","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Fertilization","Genetic_recombination","Mitosis","Multigene_family","Oxidative_stress","Synizesis_(biology)"]}
