The causes of\ncardiovascular disease are diverse but atherosclerosis and/or hypertension are\nthe most common. Additionally, with aging come a number of physiological and\nmorphological changes that alter cardiovascular function and lead to\nsubsequently increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even in healthy\nasymptomatic individuals.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths worldwide, though since\nthe 1970s, cardiovascular mortality rates have declined in many high-income\ncountries.  At the same time, cardiovascular deaths and disease have\nincreased at a fast rate in low- and middle-income countries.\nAlthough cardiovascular disease usually affects older adults, the antecedents of\ncardiovascular disease, notably atherosclerosis, begin in early life, making\nprimary prevention efforts necessary from childhood. There is\ntherefore increased emphasis on preventing atherosclerosis by modifying risk\nfactors, such as healthy eating, exercise, and avoidance of smoking.\n","linknr":1181,"url":"Cardiovascular_disease","recorded":1362485035,"links":43,"instances":["psychological","nutrition","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.escardio.org/guidelines-surveys/esc-guidelines/GuidelinesDocuments/guidelines-CVD-prevention.pdf"],"categories":["Heart diseases|"],"headings":["Types","Risk factors","Pathophysiology","Screening","Prevention","Management","Mortality","Research","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Cardiac_amyloidosis_very_high_mag_movat.jpg/230px-Cardiac_amyloidosis_very_high_mag_movat.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Inflammatory_heart_diseases_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg/220px-Inflammatory_heart_diseases_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Calcified_Heart.jpg/220px-Calcified_Heart.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Cardiovascular_diseases_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg/250px-Cardiovascular_diseases_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["biomarker","medicine"],["diet","nutrition"],["stress","psychological"]],"members":["stress","diet","biomarker"],"related":["Micrograph","Fibrosis","AL_amyloidosis","Movat's_stain","Heart","Blood_vessel","Artery","Capillary","Vein","Cardiovascular_system","Kidney","Atherosclerosis","Hypertension","World_Bank_high-income_economy","Healthy_diet","Physical_exercise","Tobacco_smoking","Coronary_heart_disease","Ischaemic_heart_disease","Coronary_artery_disease","Cardiomyopathy","Hypertensive_heart_disease","Heart_failure","Cor_pulmonale","Cardiac_dysrhythmias","Endocarditis","Inflammation","Endocardium","Heart_valve","Cardiomegaly","Myocarditis","Myocardium","Valvular_heart_disease","Cerebrovascular_disease","Stroke","Peripheral_arterial_disease","Congenital_heart_disease","Rheumatic_heart_disease","Epidemiology","Cholesterol","Obesity","Air_pollution","Menopause","World_Health_Organization","Estrogen","Endothelial","High-density_lipoprotein","Particulate_matter","Carotid_artery","Diabetes_mellitus","Kidney_disease","Hypercholesterolaemia","ECG","Biomarker_(medicine)","Calcification","Plaque","Fibrinogen","Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1","Homocysteine","Asymmetric_dimethylarginine","C-reactive_protein","Brain_natriuretic_peptide","Diet_(nutrition)","Tobacco","Effects_of_alcohol_on_the_human_body","Antihypertensive","Body_mass_index","Stress_(psychological)","Mediterranean_diet","University_of_Barcelona","New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Heart_disease","DASH_diet","Metabolic_syndrome","Saturated_fat","Saturated_fat_and_cardiovascular_disease_controversy","Polyunsaturated_fats","Carbohydrates","Trans_fatty_acids","Low_salt_diet","Congestive_heart_failure","Omega-3_fatty_acid","Antioxidant","Vitamin","Aspirin","Statins","Jerry_Morris","Biomedical_research","Harvard_University","McDonald's","Osteoprotegerin","NF-ÎºB","Infection"]}
