{"cursor":"51768","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, designed by Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir John Fowler, opened in 1890, and now\nowned by Network Rail, is designated as a Category A listed building by Historic\nScotland.]]\n\nA 'listed building', in the United Kingdom, is a building that has been placed\non the 'Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic\nInterest'. It is a widely used status, applied to around half a million\nbuildings. The statutory body maintaining the list in England is English\nHeritage; Cadw (The Historic Environment Service of the Welsh Government) in\nWales; Historic Scotland in Scotland; and the Northern Ireland Environment\nAgency (NIEA) in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe term has also been used in the Republic of Ireland, where buildings are\nsurveyed for the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage in accordance with\nthe country's obligations under the Granada Convention. However, the preferred\nterm in Ireland is protected structure.\n\nA listed building may not be demolished, extended, or altered without special\npermission from the local planning authority (which typically consults the\nrelevant central government agency, particularly for significant alterations to\nthe more notable listed buildings). Exemption from secular listed building\ncontrol is provided for some buildings in current use for worship, but only in\ncases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent\npermissions procedure. Owners of listed buildings are, in some circumstances,\ncompelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they\nfail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations. The listing procedure\nallows for buildings to be removed from the list if the listing is shown to be\nin error.\n\nAlthough most structures appearing on the lists are buildings, other structures\nsuch as bridges, monuments, sculptures, war memorials, and even milestones and\nmileposts and The Beatles' Abbey Road pedestrian crossing are also\nlisted. Ancient, military and uninhabited structures, such as Stonehenge, are\nsometimes instead classified as Scheduled Ancient Monuments and protected by\nmuch older legislation whilst cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are\ncurrently \"listed\" on a non-statutory basis. Slightly different systems operate\nin each area of the United Kingdom, though the basic principles of the listing\nremain the same.\n","linknr":873,"url":"Listed_building","recorded":1362557285,"links":65,"instances":["listed_buildings_and_conservation_areas_act_1990","engineer","company","england","amusement_park","belfast","northern_ireland"],"pdf":["http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/power-of-place/powerofplacecover1.pdf","http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/power-of-place/powerofplacecover1.pdf","http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm73/7349/7349.pdf","http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm73/7349/7349.pdf","http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Principles_Selection_Listing.pdf","http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Principles_Selection_Listing.pdf","http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/har-2010-report/HAR-report-2010.pdf","http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/har-2010-report/HAR-report-2010.pdf","http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Principles_Selection_Listing.pdf","http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Principles_Selection_Listing.pdf","http://www.ni-environment.gov.uk/criteria_for_listing_consultation_2010.pdf","http://www.ni-environment.gov.uk/criteria_for_listing_consultation_2010.pdf","http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/policy_publications/planning_statements/pps06-archaeology-built-heritage.pdf","http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/policy_publications/planning_statements/pps06-archaeology-built-heritage.pdf","http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/policy_publications/planning_statements/pps06-archaeology-built-heritage.pdf","http://www.planningni.gov.uk/index/policy/policy_publications/planning_statements/pps06-archaeology-built-heritage.pdf","http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/shep.pdf","http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/shep.pdf","http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/scotlands-listed-buildings.pdf","http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/scotlands-listed-buildings.pdf"],"categories":["Archaeology
