Belge Geol. Pal. Hydr, VII:164-166. by French-born Belgian\npaleontologist Louis Dollo which states that evolution is not reversible. This\nhypothesis was first stated by Dollo in this way: \"An organism is unable to\nreturn, even partially, to a previous stage already realized in the ranks of its\nancestors.\" Dollo, quoted in \"Evolution: Ammonites Indicate Reversal,\" in\n[[Nature (journal)|Nature]], March 21, 1970 According to this hypothesis a\nstructure or organ that has been lost or discarded through the process of\nevolution will not reappear in exactly the same form in that line of\norganisms. {{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x pmid = 18764918 volume = 62 issue =\n| 11 pages = 2727â2741 last = Goldberg first = Emma E coauthors = Boris IgiÄ\n| title = On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution journal = Evolution\n| year = 2008\n}} {{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 pmid = 18814933 volume = 23 issue = 11 pages\n| = 602â609 last = Collin first = Rachel coauthors = Maria Pia Miglietta title\n| = Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law journal = Trends in Ecology & Evolution\n| year = 2008\n}} According to Richard Dawkins, the law is \"really just a statement about\nthe statistical improbability of following exactly the same evolutionary\ntrajectory twice (or, indeed, any particular trajectory), in either\ndirection.\" Stephen Gould viewed the idea less strictly, suggesting\nthat \"irreversibility\" forecloses certain evolutionary pathways once broad forms\nhave emerged: \"[For example], once you adopt the ordinary body plan of a\nreptile, hundreds of options are forever closed, and future possibilities must\nunfold within the limits of inherited design.\" Gould, Stephen J.
