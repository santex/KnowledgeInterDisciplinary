The term column applies especially to a large round support with a\ncapital and base<ref></ref> and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small\nwooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a\nrectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the\npurpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist\nlateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \"columns\" because of\nthe similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or\narches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture,\n\"column\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional\nand decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed\nfor structural purposes; many columns are \"engaged\", that is to say form part\nof a wall.\n","title":"column","headings":["History","Structure","Classical orders","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Architecture","2: Relief","2: Parthenon","2: Doric_order","2: Rococo","2: Entasis","2: Stylobate","2: Buckling","2: Vitruvius","2: St_Peter's,_Rome","2: St._Peter's_baldachin","1: Washington,_D.C.","1: Kairouan","1: Tunisia","1: Structural_engineering","1: Wind_engineering","1: Earthquake_engineering","1: Compression_member","1: Arch","1: Iron_Age","1: Near_East","1: Mediterranean","1: Ancient_Egyptian_architecture","1: Imhotep","1: Iran","1: Persia","1: Persepolis","1: Apadana","1: Achaemenid","1: Darius_the_Great_of_Persia","1: Middle_Ages","1: Byzantine_architecture","1: Romanesque_architecture","1: Gothic_architecture","1: Renaissance_architecture","1: Baroque_architecture","1: Neo-classical_architecture","1: Plinth","1: Finial","1: Temple_of_Bel","1: Elastic_modulus","1: Radius","1: Sine","1: Tangent_modulus","1: Warsaw","1: Reinforced_concrete_column","1: Reggio_Emilia","1: Italy","1: Ancient_Rome","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Hellenic_civilization","1: Frustum","1: Colosseum","1: Tuscan_order","1: Ionic_order","1: Volute","1: City-state","1: Corinth,_Greece","1: Athens","1: Bassae","1: Composite_order","1: Solomonic_column","1: Barley_sugar","1: Constantine_I","1: Temple_of_Jerusalem","1: Bernini","1: Baroque","1: Latin_America","1: Woodturning","1: Colonnade","1: Huabiao","1: Marian_and_Holy_Trinity_columns","1: Persian_column","1: Pilaster","1: Stanchion"]}
