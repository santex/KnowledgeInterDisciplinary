It is an extremely radioactive synthetic\nelement (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in\nnature); the most stable known isotope, ununtrium-286, has a half-life of\n20&nbsp;seconds. Ununtrium was first created in 2003 by the Joint Institute for\nNuclear Research in Dubna, Russia.\n\nIn the periodic table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It is a member of\nthe 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although no chemical\nexperiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier\nhomologue to thallium in the boron group. Ununtrium is calculated to have some\nsimilar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium,\nand thallium, although it should also show several major differences from them.\nUnlike all the other p-block elements, it is even predicted to show some\ntransition metal character.\n","title":"Ununtrium","headings":["History","Naming","Nucleosynthesis","Isotopes","Predicted properties","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["4: Atomic_number","3: Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Research","3: Dubnium","3: IUPAC/IUPAP_Joint_Working_Party","2: Half-life","2: Dubna","2: Boron_group","2: Thallium","2: Boron","2: Aluminium","2: Gallium","2: Indium","2: Transition_metal","2: Ununpentium","2: Daughter_isotope","2: RIKEN","2: Electronvolt","2: Ununseptium","2: Flerovium","2: Island_of_stability","2: Superheavy_element","2: Azimuthal_quantum_number","1: Chemical_element","1: Radioactive","1: Synthetic_element","1: Periodic_table","1: P-block","1: Transactinide_element","1: Period_7_element","1: Alpha_decay","1: Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory","1: Decay_product","1: Spontaneous_fission","1: Group_5_element","1: Group_4_element","1: Bismuth-209","1: Zinc-70","1: Isotope","1: Bohrium","1: Metastable_state","1: Alpha_particle","1: Isotopes_of_dubnium","1: Mathematical_coincidence","1: Mendeleev's_predicted_elements","1: Systematic_element_name","1: Placeholder_name","1: Nihon_Keizai_Shimbun","1: Yoshio_Nishina","1: Super-heavy_element","1: Particle_accelerator","1: Fusion_reaction","1: Actinide","1: Ground_state","1: Cold_fusion","1: Gesellschaft_für_Schwerionenforschung","1: Darmstadt","1: Neptunium","1: Calcium-48","1: Neutron_number","1: Order_of_magnitude","1: Alpha-decay","1: Beta_decay","1: Plutonium","1: Primordial_element","1: Mendelevium","1: Radioactive_decay","1: Lead","1: Darmstadtium","1: University_of_California,_Berkeley","1: Glenn_Seaborg","1: Spin–orbit_interaction","1: Speed_of_light","1: Inert_pair_effect","1: Quantum_number","1: Periodic_trends","1: Electronegativity","1: Hydrogen","1: Binding_energy","1: Fluorine","1: Chlorine","1: T-shaped_molecular_geometry","1: Trigonal_planar_molecular_geometry","1: Silver","1: Isotopes_of_ununtrium"]}
