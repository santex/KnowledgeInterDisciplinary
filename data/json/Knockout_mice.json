{"cursor":"13880","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'knockout mouse' is a genetically engineered mouse in which researchers have\ninactivated, or \"knocked out,\" an existing gene by replacing it or disrupting it\nwith an artificial piece of DNA. The loss of gene activity often causes changes\nin a mouse's phenotype, which includes appearance, behavior and other observable\nphysical and biochemical characteristics.\n\nKnockout mice are important animal models for studying the role of genes which\nhave been sequenced but whose functions have not been determined. By causing a\nspecific gene to be inactive in the mouse, and observing any differences from\nnormal behaviour or physiology, researchers can infer its probable function.\n\nMice are currently the most closely related laboratory animal species to humans\nfor which the knockout technique can easily be applied. They are widely used in\nknockout experiments, especially those investigating genetic questions that\nrelate to human physiology. Gene knockout in rats is much harder and has only\nbeen possible since 2003.
