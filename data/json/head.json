Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally\nsymmetric forms do. Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as\ncephalization. In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nerve tissues concentrate at\nthe anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing.\nThrough biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also\nconcentrate into the anterior region, which collectively form the head.\n",
