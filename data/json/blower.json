The slang came from the Royal Naval ships prior to telephones.\n  Communication was direct, through a voice pipe. The pipe had a whistle\n  inserted at each end. When a message was to be passed, the caller would remove\n  the whistle at his end, place his mouth into the cavity, sealing it. He would\n  then blow hard. The whistle at the other end would attract the man on watch.\n  He would remove his whistle and call into the pipe. Conversations over, both\n  whistles were replaced.\n* [[Party horn|Party blower]] a device for making noises at a party.\n* [[Leaf blower]], a gardening tool\n* [[Heterodon platirhinos]], a.k.a. the eastern hog-nosed snake, a non-venomous\n  snake found in North America\n* Blower (surname) *Henry Blofeld (born 1939), British sports journalist\n  nicknamed \"Blowers\"\n* a braggart, or loud talker.
