For example, the study of environment, animals and plants\naround the Chernobyl disaster area has revealed an unexpected survival of many\nspecies, despite the high radiation levels. A Brazilian study in a hill in the\nstate of Minas Gerais which has high natural radiation levels from uranium\ndeposits, has also shown many radioresistant insects, worms and\nplants. Certain extremophiles, such as the bacteria\n[[Deinococcus radiodurans]] and the tardigrades can withstand acute doses of\nionizing radiation on the order of 5,000 Gy.
