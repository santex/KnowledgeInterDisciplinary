{"cursor":"5497","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn a 'substitution reaction', a functional group in a particular chemical\ncompound is replaced by another group. In organic\nchemistry, the electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution reactions are of\nprime importance. Organic substitution reactions are classified in several main\norganic reaction types depending on whether the reagent that brings about the\nsubstitution is considered an electrophile or a nucleophile, whether a reactive\nintermediate involved in the reaction is a carbocation, a carbanion or a free\nradical or whether the substrate is aliphatic or aromatic. Detailed\nunderstanding of a reaction type helps to predict the product outcome in a\nreaction. It also is helpful for optimizing a reaction with regard to variables\nsuch as temperature and choice of solvent.\n\nA good example of a substitution reaction is the photochemical chlorination of\nmethane forming methyl chloride.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n||\n\n|- align=\"center\"\n!chlorination of methane by chlorine\n|}\n","linknr":239,"url":"substituted","recorded":1362559113,"links":47,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Substitution reactions|"],"headings":["Nucleophilic substitution","Electrophilic substitution","Radical substitution","Organometallic substitution","Substituted compounds","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/SubstitutionReaction.svg/420px-SubstitutionReaction.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Electrophilic_aromatic_substitution.svg/640px-Electrophilic_aromatic_substitution.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Benz4.png/70px-Benz4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Toluol.svg/40px-Toluol.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/O-xylene.png/60px-O-xylene.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Mesitylene-2D-skeletal.png/70px-Mesitylene-2D-skeletal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Phenol-2D-skeletal.png/50px-Phenol-2D-skeletal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radical","chemistry"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","radical"],"related":["Functional_group","Chemical_compound","Organic_chemistry","Electrophile","Nucleophile","Organic_reaction","Reagent","Electrophile","Nucleophile","Reactive_intermediate","Carbocation","Carbanion","Radical_(chemistry)","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Aliphatic","Aromatic","Solvent","Photochemical","Chlorination","Methane","Methyl_chloride","Nucleophile","Aliphatic","Nucleophilic_substitution","Racemization","Aromatic","Nucleophilic_aromatic_substitution","Carboxylic_acid","Nucleophilic_acyl_substitution","Electrophile","Electrophilic_substitution","Electrophilic_aromatic_substitution","Arene","Electrophilic_addition","Radical_substitution","Radical_(chemistry)","Hunsdiecker_reaction","Coupling_reaction","Carbon-carbon_bond","Heck_reaction","Ullmann_reaction","Chemical_compound","Hydrogen","Atom","Functional_group","Alkyl","Hydroxyl","Halogen","Benzene","Simple_aromatic_ring","Heterogeneous","Benzene","Toluene","O-Xylene","Mesitylene","Phenol"]}
