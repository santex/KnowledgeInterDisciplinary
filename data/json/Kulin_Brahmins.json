{"cursor":"5731","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Kulin Brahmins' are those Brahmins in Bengal who can trace themselves to the\nfive families of Kanauj (Kanyakubja), Uttar Pradesh who migrated to Bengal.They\nwere given immense power during the reign of the Sena/Sen kings who were staunch\nHindus and did not encourage the practice of any other religion. The five\nBrahmin families were differentiated by their gotras. The Kanaujiya/kanyakubj\nBrahmins who settled in Bengal had the following gotras: (Shandilya, Bhardwaj,\nKashyap, Swavarna and Vatsav/Vatsya); these gotras denote the Rishis whose\nfollowers the Brahmins were.\n\nSome of these kuleen families settled in Barendrabhoom and some in Rarhbhoom in\nwhat is present day Bangladesh. The descendants of these families became known\nas Rarhi and Barendra Brahmins as per their settlement.\n\nThe common surnames of Rarhi Brahmin family are (ranked equally): *Mukherjee /\nMukhopadhyay (Bharadwaja) *Banerjee / Bandyopadhyay (Shandilya) *Chatterjee /\nChattopadhyay (Kashyap) *Ganguly / Gangopadhyay(Saavarna) *Ghoshal (Vaatsya)\n\nThe common surnames of Barendra Brahmin family are (ranked equally):\n*Sanyal (Vatsav/Vatsya) *Lahiri (Shandilya) *Bagchi (Shandilya) *Moitra\n(Kashyap) *Bhaduri\n\nTitles like Chakroborty, Bhattacharya, Roy, Roy Choudhury, are titles conferred\non families from among the above mentioned surnames, and could also be Kulin if\nthey are Rarhi Brahmins.\n\nKhan and Chowdhury are titles awarded to many kuleen Brahmin families because of\ntheir ancestral rule or profession.\n\nThe connection between the saraswat Brahmins and kanaujiya/kanyakubj Brahmins is\nthis that during the Aryan migration the saraswat Brahmins, called thus because\nthey lived along the banks of the river saraswati, which began to disappear\nunderground during Parushurama's time. These Brahmins migrated to south, north\nand northwestern parts of the subcontinent.\n\n'Gaud Saraswat Brahmins' The kashmiri pandits are of the same lineage as these\nsaraswats and consider themselves to be pure Aryan because their descendants\ndidn't mingle with the indigenous people. Those that settled in north India also\nwent to what is present day Uttar Pradesh, where Kannauj is located From here\nthey migrated to Gaud or Gour. From Gour, a small community comprising about\nseven families migrated to the South of the subcontinent.They were known as Gaud\nSaraswat Brahmins.\n\n\n'Kulin Pratha' (Kulin System) was initiated by the Sena kings in Bengal whereby\nthe kings gave land and power to the Brahmins to promote vedic principles in\nthe society, leading to a strict and disciplined lifestyle. Simultaneously they\nalso enforced strict rules on family and marriage rules on Brahmins, leading to\nthe birth of 'Kulin Brahmins', an apex section/class/caste of the society. It\nwas said that a person is Kulin if and only if all the 14 generations on his\nfather's and mother's side were Kulin. This created a very problematic divide\nin the society. This was also opposed by many Brahmins. Yet it became a norm,\nprobably because the kulin Brahmins got lured by the newly acquired power in\nthe society.\n\n'Kulin Pratha' was a very strict practice leading to many problems in Bengali\nsociety. If a daughter of a Kulin family doesn't wed in a Kulin family then the\nparent family loses their Kulin identity. These led to several problems like\nyoung girls getting married to old Kulin married men out of desperation of\nfinding a Kulin groom. It was not uncommon for Kulin grooms to have several\nwives, most of which stayed at their parents home, just to be wed (for the sake\nof the ritual) to a Kulin and hence maintain their Kulin status.\n\nNowadays many Brahmins have shunned their Kulin identity and have mixed equally\nwith all the Brahmins and non Brahmins in Bengal and other parts of India. It is\nhard to state the current stand of these families on Kulin Pratha. It may\nsurface during the marriage process, but the young are not concerned.\n\n\n","linknr":97,"url":"Kulin_Brahmins","recorded":1364036229,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Merging","/wiki/Bengali_Brahmins","/wiki/Talk:Bengali_Brahmins","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/Brahmin","/wiki/Bengal","/wiki/Kanauj","/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh","/wiki/Gotra","/wiki/Rishis","/wiki/Sena_dynasty","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Flag_of_India.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/25px-Flag_of_India.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=edit","/wiki/Template:India-ethno-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:India-ethno-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:India-ethno-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&oldid=536930504","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Brahmin_communities","/wiki/Category:Social_groups_of_West_Bengal","/wiki/Category:Indian_ethnic_group_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_to_be_merged_from_December_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_to_be_merged","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_October_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kulin+Brahmins&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Kulin+Brahmins","/wiki/Kulin_Brahmins","/wiki/Talk:Kulin_Brahmins","#","/wiki/Kulin_Brahmins","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Kulin_Brahmins","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Kulin_Brahmins","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&oldid=536930504","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Kulin_Brahmins&id=536930504","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Kulin+Brahmins","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Kulin+Brahmins&oldid=536930504&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Kulin_Brahmins&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulin_Brahmins","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Brahmin
