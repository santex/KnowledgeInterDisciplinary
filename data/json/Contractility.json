{"cursor":"2914","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Myocardial 'contractility' represents the intrinsic ability of the\nheart/myocardium to contract. Changes in the ability to produce force during\ncontraction result from incremental degrees of binding between myosin (thick)\nand actin (thin) filaments. The degree of binding that occurs depends on\nconcentration of calcium ions in the cell. Within an in vivo intact heart, it is\ngenerally the action/response of the sympathetic nervous system driven by\nprecisely time released catecholamine that determines the concentration of\ncalcium ions in the cytosol of cardiac muscle cells. All factors that cause an\nincrease in contractility work by causing an increase in intracellular\n[Ca ++ ] during contraction.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Contractility","recorded":1362897212,"links":12,"instances":["cardiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiovascular physiology"],"headings":["Inotropy","Model as a contributing factor","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["preload","cardiology"]],"members":["preload"],"related":["Myocardial","Intrinsic","Force","Myosin","Actin","Calcium","In_vivo","Catecholamine","Cytosol","Norepinephrine","Epinephrine","Digitalis","Chronotropic","Heart_rate","Preload_(cardiology)","Afterload","Starling's_law_of_the_heart","Anrep_effect","Bowditch_effect"]}
