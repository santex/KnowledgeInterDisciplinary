According to this\ndefinition noble gas atoms are considered molecules despite the fact that\nthey are composed of a single non-bonded atom. {{cite book\n|title=Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry |last=Chandra|first=Sulekh\n|publisher=New Age Publishers|isbn=81-224-1512-1}}\n\nA molecule may consist of atoms of a single chemical element, as with oxygen\n(O 2), or of different elements, as with water (H 2O). Atoms\nand complexes connected by non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds or ionic\nbonds are generally not considered single\nmolecules. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/388236/molecule\nMolecule], Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line\n\nMolecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and\ntherefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere.\nHowever, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of\nthe minerals that make up the crust, mantle, and core of the Earth, contain many\nchemical bonds, but are not made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical\nmolecule can be defined for ionic crystals (salts) and covalent crystals\n(network solids), although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that\nextend either in a plane (such as in graphene) or three-dimensionally (such as\nin diamond, quartz, or sodium chloride). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-\nstructure also holds for most condensed phases with metallic bonding, which\nmeans that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In glasses (solids that\nexist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by\nchemical bonds without presence of any definable molecule, but also without any\nof the regularity of repeating units that characterises crystals.\n","linknr":617,"url":"Molecular","recorded":1362486540,"links":125,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","electromagnetic_radiation","mathematics","unit","molecule","chemistry","chemistry","geology","geology","geology","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Matter","Chemistry","Molecular physics|","Molecules|"],"headings":["Molecular science","History and etymology","Molecular size","Molecular formula","Molecular geometry","Molecular spectroscopy","Theoretical aspects","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Atisane3.png/400px-Atisane3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Dalton_John_desk.jpg/130px-Dalton_John_desk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["water","molecule"],["crust","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["salt","chemistry"],["plane","mathematics"],["reactivity","chemistry"],["resonance","chemistry"],["radical","chemistry"],["mole","unit"],["rock","geology"],["salt","chemistry"],["reactivity","chemistry"],["emission","electromagnetic_radiation"],["dimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","salt","emission","plane","mole","water","resonance","reactivity","crust","mantle","rock","radical"],"related":["2D_geometric_model","Terpenoid","Atom","Covalent_bond","Chemical_bond","Ion","Quantum_physics","Organic_chemistry","Biochemistry","Polyatomic_ion","Kinetic_theory","Gas","Noble_gas","Chemical_element","Oxygen","Periodic_table","Water_(molecule)","Hydrogen_bond","Ionic_bond","Crust_(geology)","Mantle_(geology)","Earth_core","Chemical_bond","Ionic_crystal","Salt_(chemistry)","Network_solid","Unit_cell","Plane_(mathematics)","Graphene","Diamond","Quartz","Sodium_chloride","Metallic_bond","Glass","Chemical_bond","Bound_state","Atom","Polyatomic_ion","Reactivity_(chemistry)","Resonance_(chemistry)","Atomic_nucleus","Radical_(chemistry)","Ion","Rydberg_molecule","Transition_state","Van_der_Waals_bonding","Bose-Einstein_condensate","Merriam-Webster","Online_Etymology_Dictionary","Latin","Mole_(unit)","René_Descartes","John_Dalton","Law_of_definite_proportions","Law_of_multiple_proportions","Avogadro's_law","Logical_positivism","Ernst_Mach","Ludwig_Boltzmann","James_Clerk_Maxwell","Willard_Gibbs","Jean_Perrin","Chemical_substance","Chemical_compound","Frostburg_State_University","Rock_(geology)","Salt_(chemistry)","Metal","Chemical_bond","Ion","DNA","Macromolecule","Macroscopic","Polymers","Angstrom","Small_molecule","Atomic_force_microscope","Macromolecule","Supermolecule","Diatomic","Hydrogen","Mesoporous_silica","Table_of_permselectivity_for_different_substances","Empirical_formula","Integer","Ratio","Chemical_element","Water","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Alcohol","Ethanol","Carbon","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Dimethyl_ether","Atom","Isomer","Molecular_formula","Acetylene","Molecular_mass","Chemical_formula","Atomic_mass_unit","Carbon","Isotope","Network_solid","Formula_unit","Stoichiometric","Mechanical_equilibrium","Average","Reactivity_(chemistry)","Isomers","Stereoisomer","Biochemistry","Frequency_spectrum","Energy","Frequency","Planck's_constant","Absorbance","Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Diffraction","Neutrons","Electrons","X-ray","Molecular_physics","Theoretical_chemistry","Quantum_mechanic","Chemical_bond","Hydrogen_molecule-ion","One-electron_bond","Proton","Electron","Schrödinger_equation","Computational_chemistry","Potential_energy_surface","Helium","Dimer_(chemistry)","Bound_state","Atom","Van_der_Waals_molecule","Diatomic_molecule","Small_molecule","Chemical_polarity","Molecular_geometry","Covalent_bond","Noncovalent_bonding","List_of_compounds","List_of_molecules_in_interstellar_space","List_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling","Molecular_Hamiltonian","Molecular_ion","Molecular_orbital","Molecular_modelling","Molecular_design_software","WorldWide_Molecular_Matrix","Periodic_Systems_of_Small_Molecules"]}
