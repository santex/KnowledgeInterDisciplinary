{"cursor":"66422","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'antibacterial' is an agent that inhibits bacterial growth or kills\nbacteria. The term is\noften used synonymously with the term antibiotic(s). Today, however, with\nincreased knowledge of the causative agents of various infectious diseases,\nantibiotic(s) has come to denote a broader range of antimicrobial compounds,\nincluding anti-fungal and other compounds.\n\nThe term antibiotic was first used in 1942 by Selman Waksman and his\ncollaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a\nmicroorganism that is to the growth of other microorganisms in high\ndilution. This definition excluded substances that kill\nbacteria, but are not produced by microorganisms (such as gastric juices and\nhydrogen peroxide). It also excluded synthetic antibacterial compounds such as\nthe sulfonamides. Many antibacterial compounds are relatively small molecules\nwith a molecular weight of less than 2000 atomic mass units.\n\nWith advances in medicinal chemistry, most of today's antibacterials chemically\nare semisynthetic modifications of various natural compounds. These\ninclude, for example, the beta-lactam antibacterials, which include the\npenicillins (produced by fungi in the genus [[Penicillium]]), the\ncephalosporins, and the carbapenems. Compounds that are still isolated from\nliving organisms are the aminoglycosides, whereas other antibacterialsâfor\nexample, the sulfonamides, the quinolones, and the oxazolidinonesâare produced\nsolely by chemical synthesis. In accordance with this, many antibacterial\ncompounds are classified on the basis of chemical/biosynthetic origin into\nnatural, semisynthetic, and synthetic. Another classification system is based on\nbiological activity; in this classification, antibacterials are divided into two\nbroad groups according to their biological effect on microorganisms:\nbactericidal agents kill bacteria, and bacteriostatic agents slow down or stall\nbacterial growth.\n","linknr":1797,"url":"Antibacterial","recorded":1362481881,"links":107,"instances":["microbiology","country","medicine","ecology"],"pdf":["http://medind.nic.in/ibi/t02/i6/ibit02i6p390.pdf","http://www.acpm.org/2003051H.pdf","http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/media/149689/pr811-chilean-subway-installs-antimicrobial-copper.pdf","http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/media/149689/pr811-chilean-subway-installs-antimicrobial-copper.pdf"],"categories":["Antibiotics","Bactericides"],"headings":["History","Medical
