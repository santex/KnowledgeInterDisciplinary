{"cursor":"1971","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'permissible exposure limit' ('PEL' or 'OSHA PEL') is a legal limit in the\nUnited States for exposure of an employee to a chemical substance or physical\nagent. For chemicals, the chemical regulation is usually expressed in parts per\nmillion (ppm), or sometimes in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3).\nUnits of measure for physical agents such as noise are specific to the agent.\nPermissible exposure limits are established by the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA).\n\nA PEL is usually given as a time-weighted average (TWA), although some are short-\nterm exposure limits (STEL) or ceiling limits. A TWA is the average exposure\nover a specified period of time, usually a nominal eight hours. This means that,\nfor limited periods, a worker may be exposed to concentrations higher than the\nPEL, so long as the average concentration over eight hours remains lower.\n\nA short-term exposure limit is one that addresses the average exposure over a\n15-30 minute period of maximum exposure during a single work shift. A ceiling\nlimit is one that may not be exceeded for any period of time, and is applied to\nirritants and other materials that have immediate effects.\n","linknr":101,"url":"STEL","recorded":1362665217,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Health standards","Industry","Occupational Safety and Health Administration","Chemical safety","National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Nuvola_apps_kruler.png/35px-Nuvola_apps_kruler.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Law","United_States","Chemical_substance","Regulation_of_chemicals","Parts_per_million","Milligram","Cubic_meter","Noise","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Short-term_exposure_limit","Ceiling_limit","National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Recommended_exposure_limit"]}
