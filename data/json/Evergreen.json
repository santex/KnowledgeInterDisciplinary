There are many different kinds of evergreen plants,\nboth trees and shrubs. Evergreens include: *most species of conifers (e.g.,\nhemlock, blue spruce, red cedar, and white/scots/jack pine) *live oak, holly,\nand \"ancient\" gymnosperms such as cycads *most angiosperms from frost-free\nclimates, such as eucalypts and rainforest trees\n\nThe Latin binomial term sempervirens (literally, \"always green\") refers to the\nevergreen nature of the plant, for instance:-\n:[[Acer sempervirens]] (a maple) [[Cupressus sempervirens]] (a cypress)\n:[[Lonicera sempervirens]] (a honeysuckle) [[Sequoia sempervirens]] (a sequoia)\n:[[Ulmus parvifolia]] 'Sempervirens' (an elm)\n\nAn additional special case exists in [[Welwitschia]], an African gymnosperm\nplant that produces only two leaves which grow continuously throughout the\nplant's life but gradually wear away at the apex. Welwitschia can live for over\n1000 years.\n\nLeaf persistence in evergreen plants varies from a few months (with new leaves\nconstantly being grown as old ones are shed) to several decades (over thirty\nyears in the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine Ewers, F. W. & Schmid, R. (1981).\nLongevity of needle fascicles of Pinus longaeva (Bristlecone Pine) and other\nNorth American pines.
