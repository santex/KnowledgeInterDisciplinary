{"cursor":"4983","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Elution' is a term used in analytical and organic chemistry to describe the\nprocess of extracting one material from another by washing with a solvent (as in\nwashing of loaded ion-exchange resins to remove captured ions).\n\nIn a liquid chromatography experiment, for example, an analyte is generally\nadsorbed, or \"bound to\", an adsorbent in a liquid chromatography column. The\nadsorbent, a solid phase (stationary phase), is a powder which is coated onto a\nsolid support. Based on an adsorbent's composition, it can have varying\naffinities to \"hold\" onto other moleculesâforming a thin film on its outside\nsurface (or on its internal surface if there are cavities within the compound).\nElution then is the process of removing analytes from the adsorbent by running a\nsolvent, called an \"eluent\", past the adsorbent/analyte complex. As the solvent\nmolecules \"elute\", or travel down through the chromatography column, they can\neither pass by the adsorbent/analyte complex or they can displace the analyte by\nbinding to the adsorbent in its place. After the solvent molecules displace the\nanalyte, the analyte can be carried out of the column for analysis. This is why\nas the mobile phase passes out of the column, it typically flows into a detector\nor is collected for compositional analysis.\n\nPredicting and controlling the order of elution is a key aspect of column\nchromatographic methods.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Mobile_phase","recorded":1362540675,"links":19,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry","Chromatography"],"headings":["Eluotropic Series","Eluent","Eluate","Elution Time and Elution Volume","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Chromatography.png/220px-Chromatography.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stationary_phase","chemistry"]],"members":["stationary_phase"],"related":["Analytical_chemistry","Organic_chemistry","Chromatography","Analyte","Adsorbent","Chemical_affinity","Mobile_phase","Detector","Adsorbent","Solvent","Analyte","Eluent","Chromatography","N-hexane","Methanol","Water","Stationary_phase_(chemistry)","Chromatography","Liquid_chromatography","Gas_chromatography","Analyte","Chromatography","Amino_acid","Ion-exchange_chromatography","CRC_Press","Desorption","Gradient_elution","Leaching"]}
