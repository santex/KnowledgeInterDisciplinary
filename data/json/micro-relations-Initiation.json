It could also be a formal admission to adulthood in a\ncommunity or one of its formal components. In an extended sense it can also\nsignify a transformation in which the initiate is 'reborn' into a new role.\n\nExamples of initiation ceremonies might include Hindu diksha, Christian baptism\nor confirmation, Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, acceptance into a fraternal\norganization, secret society or religious order, or graduation from school or\nrecruit training.\n\nA person taking the initiation ceremony in traditional rites, such as those\ndepicted in these pictures, is called an initiate or initiand.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Initiation","recorded":1362903311,"links":36,"instances":["christian_sacrament","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rites of passage"],"headings":["Etymology","Religious and other spiritual initiations","Trade union initiations","Naval and military initiations","Gang initiations","Tribal initiations","Mircea Eliade","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Sepik_River_initiation_PNG_1975.JPG/220px-Sepik_River_initiation_PNG_1975.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Freimaurer_Initiation.jpg/350px-Freimaurer_Initiation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Sepik_River_initiations_1975.JPG/220px-Sepik_River_initiations_1975.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["confirmation","christian_sacrament"],["action","philosophy"]],"members":["confirmation","action"],"related":["Rite_of_passage","Ceremony","Diksha","Baptism","Confirmation_(Christian_sacrament)","B'nai_Mitzvah","Fraternal_organization","Secret_society","Religious_order","Graduation","Recruit_training","Latin","Action_(philosophy)","Circumstance","Happening","Initiation_rite","Eleusinian_Mysteries","Mycenae","Bronze_age","Ritual_magic","Esotericism","Apostolic_succession","Vaishnavism","Sant_Mat","Surat_Shabd_Yoga","Wicca","Gnosis","Guru","Trade_union","Organization","Collective_bargaining","Contract","Person","Hazing","Crossing_the_equator","Cruise_liner","Gang","Bapedi","Circumcision","Genital_mutilation","Female_genital_cutting","Genital_mutilation","Australian_Aboriginal","Scarification","Central_Australian","Subincision","Min_peoples","New_Guinea_Highlands","Urapmin_people","Urapmin_language","Mircea_Eliade","Puberty","Secret_Society","Mystical","Vocation","Shaman","Puberty","Cognitive_dissonance","Interpersonal_attraction","Rewards","Conformity","Affiliation","Hazing","Mircea_Eliade"]}
