All measurements consist of three parts:\n magnitude, dimensions (units) and uncertainty. They are used to make definitive\n comparisons between observations and reduce confusion. Even in cases of clear\n qualitative similarity or difference, increased precision through quantitative\n measurement is often preferred in order to aid in replication. For example,\n different colours may be reported based on wavelengths of light, instead of\n vague (qualitative) terms such as \"green\" and \"blue\" which are often\n interpreted differently by different people. The science of measurement is\n called metrology.\n\nMeasurements are most commonly made in the SI system, which contains seven\nfundamental units: kilogram, metre, candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and mole.\nSix of these units are artifact-free (defined without reference to a particular\nphysical object which serves as a standard); the definition of one remaining\nunit, the kilogram is still embodied in an artifact which rests at the BIPM\noutside Paris. Eventually, it is hoped that new SI definitions will be uniformly\nartifact-free.\n\nArtifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a\nphysical constant or other invariable phenomenon in nature, in contrast to\nstandard artifacts which can be damaged or otherwise change slowly over time.\nInstead, the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in\ndetermining the value of the constant it is tied to.\n\n[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|right|250px|The seven base units in the SI system.\nArrows point from units to those that depend on them; as the accuracy of the\nformer increase, so will the accuracy of the latter. ]] The first proposal to\ntie an SI base unit to an experimental standard independent of fiat was by\nCharles Sanders Peirce (1839â1914), who proposed to define the metre\nin terms of the wavelength of a spectral line. C.S. Peirce (July 1879) \"Note\non the Progress of Experiments for Comparing a Wave-length with a Metre\"\nAmerican Journal of Science, as referenced by  This directly influenced\nthe Michelson-Morley experiment; Michelson and Morley cite Peirce, and improve\non his method.\n","recorded":1362123732,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"414","instances":["metrology","imperial_mass","mathematics","unit","united_kingdom","mass","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf","http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf"],"categories":["Measurement|","Metrology"],"headings":["Standards","Units
