{"cursor":"11832","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn genetics, 'epistasis' is a phenomenon in which the expression of one gene\ndepends on the presence of one or more \"'modifier genes'.\" A gene whose\nphenotype is expressed is called epistatic, while one whose phenotype is altered\nor suppressed is called hypostatic. If two epistatic genes A and B are mutated,\nand each mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype but the two mutations\ntogether show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is\nepistatic to gene B. Epistasis can be contrasted with dominance, which is an\ninteraction between alleles at the same gene locus. Epistasis is often studied\nin relation to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and polygenic inheritance.\n\nIn general, the expression of any one allele depends in a complicated way on\nmany other alleles; but, because of the way that the science of population\ngenetics was developed, evolutionary scientists tend to think of epistasis as\nthe exception to the rule. In the first models of natural selection devised in\nthe early 20th century, each gene was considered to make its own characteristic\ncontribution to fitness, against an average background of other genes. Some\nintroductory college courses still teach population genetics this way.\n\nEpistasis and 'genetic interaction' refer to different aspects of the same\nphenomenon. The term epistasis is widely used in population genetics and refers\nespecially to the statistical properties of the phenomenon, and does not\nnecessarily imply biochemical interaction between gene products. However, in\ngeneral epistasis is used to denote the departure from 'independence' of the\neffects of different genetic loci. Confusion often arises due to the varied\ninterpretation of 'independence' between different branches of\nbiology. {{Cite journal\n | journal = Human Molecular Genetics year = 2002 volume = 11 issue = 20 pages =\n | 2463â8 title = Epistasis: what it means, what it doesn't mean, and\n | statistical methods to detect it in humans author = Cordell, Heather J. doi =\n | 10.1093/hmg/11.20.2463 pmid=12351582\n}}\n\nExamples of tightly linked genes having epistatic effects on fitness are found\nin supergenes and the human major histocompatibility complex genes. The effect\ncan occur directly at the genomic level, where one gene could code for a protein\npreventing transcription of the other gene. Alternatively, the effect can occur\nat the phenotypic level. For example, the gene causing albinism would hide the\ngene controlling color of a person's hair. In another example, a gene coding for\na widow's peak would be hidden by a gene causing baldness. Fitness epistasis\n(where the affected trait is fitness) is one cause of linkage disequilibrium.\n\nStudying genetic interactions can reveal gene function, the nature of the\nmutations, functional redundancy, and protein interactions. Because protein\ncomplexes are responsible for most biological functions, genetic interactions\nare a powerful tool.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Epistasis","recorded":1362669658,"links":36,"instances":["chemistry","genetics","genetics","genetics","journal","genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics"],"headings":["Classification by fitness or trait value","Sex","Functional or mechanistic classification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Synergistic_versus_antagonistic_epistasis.svg/200px-Synergistic_versus_antagonistic_epistasis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dominance","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["fitness","biology"],["locus","genetics"],["nature","journal"],["complementation","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["transvection","genetics"],["dimer","chemistry"]],"members":["dimer","transvection","transcription","locus","nature","dominance","fitness","complementation"],"related":["Genetics","Dominance_(genetics)","Interaction","Gene","Locus_(genetics)","Quantitative_Trait_Locus","Polygenic_inheritance","Population_genetics","Natural_selection","Population_genetics","Population_genetics","Statistics","Human_Molecular_Genetics","Supergene","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Protein","Transcription_(genetics)","Albinism","Widow's_peak","Fitness_(biology)","Linkage_disequilibrium","Haploid","Locus_(genetics)","Evolution_of_sex","Alexey_Kondrashov","Nature_(journal)","Gene_regulatory_network","Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_U_S_A","Complementation_(genetics)","Locus_(genetics)","Genetic_map","Locus_(genetics)","Transvection_(genetics)","Dimer_(chemistry)","Co-adaptation","Epistasis_and_functional_genomics","Mutation","Quantitative_trait_locus","Interactome"]}
