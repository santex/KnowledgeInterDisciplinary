UIC Leaflet 650.\nStandard designation of axle arrangement on locomotives and multiple-unit sets.\n[ Obligatory ]. 5th edition of 1.1.83. It is used in much of the world.\nThe United Kingdom used a related scheme. The United States uses the simplified\nAAR wheel arrangement for modern locomotives.\n\nIt is a more versatile system than Whyte notation, making fewer assumptions\nabout locomotive layout. Some locomotives are impossible to classify using Whyte\nnotation, but UIC classification handles them easily. The UIC classification is\nalso much more suited to diesel and electric locomotives.\n","linknr":184,"url":"UIC_classification","recorded":1362553992,"links":21,"instances":["locomotive","symbol","great_britain"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Locomotive classification systems","International Union of Railways|Classification","International rail transport","Rail transport in Europe"],"headings":["German classification","Structure","Examples","United Kingdom","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["prime","symbol"],["mallet","locomotive"],["southern_railway","great_britain"]],"members":["mallet","prime","southern_railway"],"related":["Wheel_arrangement","Locomotive","Multiple_unit","Tram","International_Union_of_Railways","United_Kingdom","United_States","AAR_wheel_arrangement","Whyte_notation","Diesel_locomotive","Electric_locomotive","Traction_motor","Prime_(symbol)","Bogie","Mallet_(locomotive)","Union_Pacific_Big_Boy","Garratt","Tank_locomotive","Tram","0-6-0","Bogie","JNR_Class_EF58","PRR_GG1","0-8-0","Leading_wheel","Trailing_wheel","2-8-2","0-10-0","Whyte_notation","Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)","Oliver_Bulleid","SR_West_Country_and_Battle_of_Britain_Classes","AAR_wheel_arrangement","Swiss_locomotive_and_railcar_classification","Wheel_arrangement","Whyte_notation","Co-Co_locomotives","International_Union_of_Railways","UIC_identification_marking_for_tractive_stock","UIC_classification_of_railway_coaches","UIC_classification_of_goods_wagons","List_of_UIC_country_codes"]}
