Soil which is\nnot part of the rhizosphere is known as bulk soil. The rhizosphere contains many\nbacteria that feed on sloughed-off plant cells, termed rhizodeposition, and the\nproteins and sugars released by roots. Protozoa and nematodes that graze on\nbacteria are also more abundant in the rhizosphere. Thus, much of the nutrient\ncycling and disease suppression needed by plants occurs immediately adjacent to\nroots.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Rhizosphere","recorded":1362505712,"links":29,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soil biology","Plant roots","Environmental soil science"],"headings":["Secretions","Biological control","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rhizosphere.svg/300px-Rhizosphere.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mutualism","biology"]],"members":["mutualism"],"related":["Bacteria","Hyphae","Nematode","Soil","Root","Microorganism","Bulk_soil","Bacteria","Protozoa","Nematode","Strigolactone","Mycorhiza","Germination","Nitrogen_fixation","Nod_factor","Root_nodule","Rice_plant","Diurnality","Allelopathy","Garlic_mustard","Mutualism_(biology)","Tree","North_America","Temperate_broadleaf_and_mixed_forest","Bulk_soil","Mucigel","Soil_respiration"]}
