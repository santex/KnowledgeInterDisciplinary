Like\nskin, hair is a stratified squamous, keratinized epithelium made of multi-\nlayered, flat cells with overlying keratin (a protein), whose rope-like\nfilaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft.\n\nHair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent\nphases: anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Each phase has specific\ncharacteristics that determine the length of the hair. All three phases occur\nsimultaneously; one strand of hair may be in the anagen phase, while another\nis in the telogen phase.\n\nThe body has different types of hair, including vellus hair and androgenic hair,\neach with its own type of cellular construction. The different construction\ngives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth\nand protection.\n","linknr":282,"url":"Hair_growth","recorded":1362897741,"links":18,"instances":["mouth"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human hair"],"headings":["Growth cycle","Growth inhibitors and disorders","Hair-growth stimulants","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lip","mouth"]],"members":["lip"],"related":["Soles_of_the_feet","Lip_(mouth)","Eyelids","Eyelashes","Stratified_squamous_epithelium","Keratinized","Keratin","Protein_filament","Anagen","Catagen","Telogen","Vellus_hair","Androgenic_hair","Hair_follicle","Dermal","Moult","Chemotherapy","Cell_division","Alopecia","Alopecia_areata","Autoimmune_disease","Anagen","Telogen","Traction_alopecia","Vellus_hair","Dieckol","Proanthocyanidin_B3","Citrullus_colocynthis","Minoxidil","Evolution_of_hair"]}
