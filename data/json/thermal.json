Thermals are created by the uneven heating\nof the Earth's surface from solar radiation, and are an example of convection,\nspecifically atmospheric convection. The Sun warms the ground, which in turn\nwarms the air directly above it.<ref></ref> Dark earth, urban areas and roadways\nare good sources of thermals.\n\nThe warmer air near the surface expands, becoming less dense than the\nsurrounding air mass. The mass of lighter air rises, and as it does, it cools\ndue to its expansion in the lower pressure of the higher altitude. It stops\nrising when it has cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding air.\nAssociated with a thermal is a downward flow surrounding the thermal column. The\ndownward moving exterior is caused by colder air being displaced at the top of\nthe thermal.\n\nThe size and strength of thermals are influenced by the properties of the lower\natmosphere (the [[troposphere]]). Generally, when the air is cold, bubbles of\nwarm air are formed by the ground heating the air above it and can rise like a\nhot air balloon. The air is then said to be unstable. If there is a warm layer\nof air higher up, an inversion can prevent thermals from rising high and the air\nis said to be stable.\n\nThermals are often indicated by the presence of visible cumulus clouds at the\napex of the thermal. When a steady wind is present, thermals and their\nrespective cumulus clouds can align in rows oriented with wind direction,\nsometimes referred to as \"cloud streets\" by soaring and glider pilots. Cumulus\nclouds are formed by the rising air in a thermal as it ascends and cools, until\nthe water vapor in the air begins to condense into visible droplets. The\ncondensing water releases latent heat energy allowing the air to rise higher.\nVery unstable air can reach the level of free convection (LFC) and thus rise to\ngreat heights condensing large quantities of water and so forming showers or\neven thunderstorms.\n\nThermals are one of the many sources of lift used by soaring birds and\ngliders to soar.\n\nThermals on the sun typically form hexagonal prisms (Bénard cells).\n","title":"thermal","headings":["Thermal detectors","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Air","1: Earth's_atmosphere","1: Solar_radiation","1: Convection","1: Atmospheric_convection","1: Sun","1: Density","1: Temperature_inversion","1: Cumulus_cloud","1: Clouds","1: Water_vapor","1: Condense","1: Latent_heat","1: Level_of_free_convection","1: Soaring_birds","1: Unpowered_aircraft","1: Gliding_flight","1: Bénard_cell","1: Atmospheric_thermodynamics"]}
