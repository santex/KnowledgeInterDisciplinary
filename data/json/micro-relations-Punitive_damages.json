{"cursor":"16133","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Punitive damages' or 'exemplary damages' are damages intended to reform or\ndeter the defendant and others from engaging in conduct similar to that which\nformed the basis of the lawsuit. Although the purpose of punitive damages is not\nto compensate the plaintiff, the plaintiff will in fact receive all or some\nportion of the punitive damage award.\n\nPunitive damages are often awarded where compensatory damages are deemed an\ninadequate remedy. The court may impose them to prevent under-compensation of\nplaintiffs, to allow redress for undetectable torts and taking some strain away\nfrom the criminal justice system. See Kemezy v. Peters, 79 F.3d 33 (7th Cir.\n1996) (Posner, J.) However, punitive damages awarded under court systems\nthat recognize them may be difficult to enforce in jurisdictions that do not\nrecognize them. For example, punitive damages awarded to one party in a US case\nwould be difficult to get recognition for in a European court, where punitive\ndamages are most likely to be considered to violate ordre public. See\n[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/26/america/damages.php Courts outside U.S.\nwary of punitive damages], International Herald Tribune 2008-03-26\n\nBecause they are usually paid in excess of the plaintiff's provable injuries,\npunitive damages are awarded only in special cases, usually under tort law,\nwhere the defendant's conduct was egregiously insidious. Punitive damages cannot\ngenerally be awarded in contract disputes. The main exception is in insurance\nbad faith cases in the United States, where the insurer's breach of contract is\nalleged to be so egregious as to amount to a breach of the \"implied covenant of\ngood faith and fair dealing,\" and is therefore considered to be a tort cause of\naction eligible for punitive damages (in excess of the value of the insurance\npolicy). The landmark cases that established this tort were Comunale v.\nTraders & General Ins. Co., [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/50C2d654.htm 50\nCal. 2d 654, 328 P.2d 198, 68 A.L.R.2d 883] (1958) (third-party liability\ninsurance), and Gruenberg v. Aetna Ins.
