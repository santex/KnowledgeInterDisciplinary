Believers may consider or believe that they can communicate with the\ndeity, who can respond supernaturally to their entreaties, and that the deity's\nmyths are true. {{cite book |title=The Sociology of\nReligion |isbn=0-807-04205-6 |year=1993 |last=Weber |first=Max |authorlink=Max\nWeber |page=1 |publisher=Beacon Press }} Some religions have one supreme\ndeity, others have multiple deities of various ranks.\n\nC. Scott Littleton's Gods, Goddesses, and Mythology defined a deity as \"a being\n   with powers greater than those of ordinary humans, but who interacts with\n   humans, positively or negatively, in ways that carry humans to new levels of\n   consciousness beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary\n   life.\"\n\nDeities are depicted in a variety of forms, but are also frequently expressed as\nhaving human form. Some faiths and traditions consider it blasphemous to imagine\nor depict the deity as having any concrete form. Deities are often thought to be\nimmortal, and are commonly assumed to have personalities and to possess\nconsciousness, intellects, desires, and emotions comparable but usually superior\nto those of humans. A male deity is a god, while a female deity is a goddess.\n\nNatural phenomena whose causes are not understood, such as lightning and\ncatastrophes such as earthquakes and floods, are sometimes attributed to them.\nThey may be thought to be able to work supernatural miracles and to be the\nauthorities and controllers of various aspects of human life (such as birth or\nan afterlife). Some deities are asserted to be the directors of time and fate\nitself, to be the givers of human law and morality, to be the ultimate judges of\nhuman worth and behavior, and to be the designers and creators of everything\n(the Earth or Universe and all contents).\n","linknr":807,"url":"Deity","recorded":1362566182,"links":77,"instances":["male_deity","philosophy","gods","hinduism","buddhism","mythology","mythology","mythology","deity","religion"],"pdf":["http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/Supernaturalizing.pdf","http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/Supernaturalizing.pdf"],"categories":["Deities|"],"headings":["Etymology","Similar
