{"cursor":"13976","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Electrostatic discharge' (ESD) is the sudden flow of electricity between two\nobjects caused by contact, an electrical short, or dielectric breakdown. ESD can\nbe caused by a buildup of static electricity by tribocharging, or by\nelectrostatic induction.\n\nESD includes spectacular electric sparks, but also less dramatic forms which may\nbe neither seen nor heard, yet still be large enough to cause damage to\nsensitive electronic devices. Electric sparks require a field strength above\nabout 4 kV/cm in air, as notably occurs in lightning strikes. Other forms of ESD\ninclude corona discharge from sharp electrodes and brush discharge from blunt\nelectrodes.\n\nESD can cause a range of harmful effects of importance in industry, including\nmethane gas and coal dust explosions, as well as failure of solid state\nelectronics components such as integrated circuits. These can suffer permanent\ndamage when subjected to high voltages. Electronics manufacturers therefore\nestablish electrostatic protective areas free of static, using measures to\nprevent charging such as avoiding highly charging materials, and measures to\nremove static such as grounding human workers, providing antistatic devices, and\ncontrolling humidity.\n\nESD simulators may be used to test electronic devices, for example with a human\nbody model or a charged device model.\n","linknr":311,"url":"Electrostatic_discharge","recorded":1362485755,"links":41,"instances":["physics","material","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.baytems.com/docs/LIT-S0017-001.pdf","http://www.baytems.com/docs/LIT-S0017-001.pdf"],"categories":["Electrical breakdown","Electrical safety","Electrostatics","Plasma physics"],"headings":["Causes of ESD","Types of ESD","Damage prevention in electronics","Simulation and testing for electronic devices","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg/190px-VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Thunder_rym.png/350px-Thunder_rym.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Hindenburg_burning.jpg/220px-Hindenburg_burning.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Static_discharger_with_plastic_guards.jpg/200px-Static_discharger_with_plastic_guards.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Electrostatic-discharge.jpg/256px-Electrostatic-discharge.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conductor","material"],["plasma","physics"],["ohm","unit"]],"members":["plasma","conductor","ohm"],"related":["Short_circuit","Dielectric_breakdown","Electronics","Integrated_circuit","Antistatic_device","Static_electricity","Triboelectricity","Friction","Electrostatic_induction","Styrofoam","Electric_field","Dielectric_strength","Electrons","Ion","Conductor_(material)","Dielectric_breakdown","Lightning","Electric_potential","Volt","Energy","Paschen's_law","Earth's_atmosphere","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Diatomic","Ozone","Nitrogen_oxide","NOx","Nitrogen_fixation","Ozonolysis","Water_purification","Fire_triangle","Hindenburg_disaster","Thermite","Hydrogen","Airship","Thunderstorm","New_Jersey","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","American_National_Standards_Institute","Conducting_wrist_strap","Antistatic_mat","Humidity","Dielectric","Static_discharger","Trailing_edge","Plasma_(physics)","Tesla_coil","ESD_Simulator","Human_body_model","Capacitor","Resistor","Device_under_test","JEDEC","Farad","Ohm_(unit)","MIL-STD-883","European_Union","JEDEC","Antistatic_device","Automotive_Electronics_Council","Dielectric_wireless_receiver","Electric_arc","Electromagnetic_pulse","Electrostatic_Discharge_Association","Electrostatic_voltmeter","Hindenburg_disaster","Latchup","Semiconductor","Spark_gap","Spark_plug","Static_electricity","Wimshurst_machine"]}
