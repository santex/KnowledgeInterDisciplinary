Although the population\nrecorded in the 2001 census is 10,406,<ref name=\"popn\"/> it has had city status\nsince 1205. It is the second smallest English city in terms of area and\npopulation after the City of London although, unlike the latter, Wells is not\npart of a larger metropolitan conurbation, and is consequently described in some\nsources as being England's smallest city.<ref></ref><ref></ref>\n\nThe name Wells derives from the three wells dedicated to Saint Andrew, one in\nthe market place and two within the grounds of the Bishop's Palace and\ncathedral.<ref></ref> There was a small Roman settlement around the wells,\nbut its importance grew under the Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a\nminster church in 704, around which the settlement grew. Wells became a\ntrading centre and involved in cloth making before its involvement in both\nthe English Civil War and the Monmouth Rebellion during the 17th century. In\nthe 19th century, transport infrastructure improved with stations on three\ndifferent railway lines.\n\nThe cathedral and the associated religious and architectural history have made\nWells a tourist destination, which provides much of the employment. The city has\na variety of sporting and cultural activities and houses several schools\nincluding The Blue School, a state coeducational comprehensive school originally\nfounded in 1641 (and became commonly known as the Blue School by 1654) and the\nindependent Wells Cathedral School, which was founded in 909 and is one of the\nfive established musical schools for school-age children in Britain. The\nhistoric architecture of the city has also been used as a location for several\nfilms and television programmes.\n",
