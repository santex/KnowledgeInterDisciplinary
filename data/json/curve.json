      "text" : "\n, a simple example of a curve]] In mathematics, a 'curve' (also called a 'curved\nline' in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but\nwhich is not required to be straight. This entails that a line is a special case\nof curve, namely a curve with null curvature.<ref> In current language, a line\nis typically required to be straight. Historically, however, lines could be\n\"curved\" or \"straight\". </ref> Often curves in two-dimensional (plane curves) or\nthree-dimensional (space curves) Euclidean space are of interest.\n\nVarious disciplines within mathematics have given the term different meanings\ndepending on the area of study, so the precise meaning depends on context.\nHowever many of these meanings are special instances of the definition which\nfollows. A curve is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to a line.\nIn everyday language, this means that a curve is a set of points which, near\neach of its points, looks like a line, up to a deformation. A simple example of\na curve is the parabola, shown to the right. A large number of other curves have\nbeen studied in multiple mathematical fields.\n\nThe term curve has several meanings in non-mathematical language as well. For\nexample, it can be almost synonymous with mathematical function (as in\n[[learning curve]]), or graph of a function (as in [[Phillips curve]]).\n\nAn arc or segment of a curve is a part of a curve that is bounded by two\ndistinct end points and contains every point on the curve between its end\npoints. Depending on how the arc is defined, either of the two end points may\nor may not be part of it. When the arc is straight, it is typically called a\nline segment.\n",
