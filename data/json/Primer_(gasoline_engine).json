{"cursor":"8574","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n petrol engine of the Bugatti Veyron]]\n\nA 'petrol engine' (known as a 'gasoline engine' in North America) is an internal\ncombustion engine with spark-ignition, designed to run on petrol (gasoline) and\nsimilar volatile fuels. It was invented in 1876 in Europe. In most petrol\nengines, the fuel and air are usually pre-mixed before compression (although\nsome modern petrol engines now use cylinder-direct petrol injection). The pre-\nmixing was formerly done in a carburetor, but now it is done by electronically\ncontrolled fuel injection, except in small engines where the cost/complication\nof electronics does not justify the added engine efficiency. The process differs\nfrom a diesel engine in the method of mixing the fuel and air, and in using\nspark plugs to initiate the combustion process. In a diesel engine, only air is\ncompressed (and therefore heated), and the fuel is injected into very hot air at\nthe end of the compression stroke, and self-ignites.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Primer_(gasoline_engine)","recorded":1362544514,"links":45,"instances":["electrical","engine","engine","engine_cooling"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Internal combustion piston engines","Gasoline engines"],"headings":["Compression ratio","Speed and efficiency","Applications","Design","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Volkswagen_W16.jpg/220px-Volkswagen_W16.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/4StrokeEngine_Ortho_3D_Small.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radiator","engine_cooling"],["magneto","electrical"],["bore","engine"],["stroke","engine"]],"members":["magneto","stroke","bore","radiator"],"related":["Bugatti_Veyron","North_America","Internal_combustion_engine","Spark-ignition_engine","Gasoline","Carburetor","Fuel_injection","Diesel_engine","Spark_plug","Automobile","Motorcycle","Aircraft","Motorboat","Small_engine","Lawn_mower","Chainsaw","Engine-generator","Diesel_engine","Bus","Truck","Locomotive","Bedford_OB","Bedford_M_series","GE_57-ton_gas-electric_boxcab","Four-stroke_cycle","Two-stroke_cycle","Wankel_engine","Straight_engine","V_engine","Flat_engine","Volkswagen","Flat-6","Porsche","Subaru","Rotary_engine","Radial_engine","Air-cooled_engine","Cylinder_head","Water_jacket","Radiator_(engine_cooling)","Antifreeze","Ethylene_glycol","Propylene_glycol","Water_pump","Boiling_point","Spark_ignition","High_voltage","Magneto_(electrical)","Ignition_coil","Ignition_timing","Engine_Control_Unit","Flywheel","Watt","Horsepower","Dynamometer","Power_steering","Air_conditioner","Radiator","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Bore_(engine)","Gasoline_direct_injection","Stroke_(engine)"]}
