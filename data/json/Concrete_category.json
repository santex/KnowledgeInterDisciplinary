{"cursor":"11021","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, a 'concrete category' is a category that is equipped with a\nfaithful functor to the category of sets. This functor makes it possible to\nthink of the objects of the category as sets with additional structure, and of\nits morphisms as structure-preserving functions. Many important categories have\nobvious interpretations as concrete categories, for example the category of\ntopological spaces and the category of groups, and trivially also the category\nof sets itself. On the other hand, the homotopy category of topological spaces\nis not 'concretizable', i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to the\ncategory of sets.\n\nA concrete category, when defined without reference to the notion of a category,\nconsists of a class of objects, each equipped with an underlying set; and for\nany two objects A and B a set of functions, called morphisms, from the\nunderlying set of A to the underlying set of B. Furthermore, for every object A,\nthe identity function on the underlying set of A must be a morphism from A to A,\nand the composition of a morphism from A to B followed by a morphism from B to C\nmust be a morphism from A to C.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Concrete_category","recorded":1362676284,"links":15,"instances":["logic","mathematics","set_theory","category_theory","operator_theory","mathematics","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://katmat.math.uni-bremen.de/acc/acc.pdf"],"categories":["Category theory"],"headings":["Definition","Remarks","Further examples","Counter-examples","Implicit structure of concrete categories","Relative concreteness","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/4/4b48ba4a12ccc80554c1f85ea525a16a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/f/b/5fbbd0d2577673454bad3b24f236be14.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/e/98e01a6712bf97f5c030b1ae3d4365b4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/9/b/99bb257fce2da1e36c3ca6fec0c1a0a4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/c/bfceebea7a72161817a7db835b9f3ee0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/4/4/d445c6f067e8fbeb64a25c41591122aa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/3/6/53694d6b55a701e51996a206ab206500.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/1/88105bef22c06edbaa4bc75577dee860.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/4/7/3474a7ef86421882e33f305a063ea8e7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/e/a/9ead371987d4ebb4d5996ccb86cd0f69.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["category","category_theory"],["class","set_theory"],["property","philosophy"],["set","mathematics"],["relation","mathematics"],["contraction","operator_theory"],["signature","logic"],["structure","mathematical_logic#many-sorted_structures"]],"members":["signature","structure","relation","class","category","contraction","set","property"],"related":["Category_(category_theory)","Faithful_functor","Category_of_sets","Mathematical_structure","Category_of_topological_spaces","Category_of_groups","Homotopy_category_of_topological_spaces","Class_(set_theory)","Faithful_functor","Forgetful_functor","Codomain","Property_(philosophy)","Identity_functor","Group_action","Permutation_group","Poset","Category_of_relations","Set_(mathematics)","Relation_(mathematics)","Complete_lattice","Complete_lattices","Yoneda_embedding","Banach_spaces","Contraction_(operator_theory)","Unit_ball","Topological_space","Homotopy","Peter_Freyd","Natural_equivalence","Cardinal_number","Subfunctor","Natural_transformation","Proper_class","Signature_(logic)","Equivalence_of_categories","Topos_theory"]}
