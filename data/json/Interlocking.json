{"cursor":"22463","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, in 1993]] In railway signalling, an 'interlocking' is an arrangement of signal\napparatus that prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of tracks\nsuch as junctions or crossings. The signalling appliances and tracks are\nsometimes collectively referred to as an interlocking plant. An interlocking is\ndesigned so that it is impossible to give clear signals to trains unless the\nroute to be used is proved to be safe.\n\nIn North America, the official railroad definition of interlocking is: \"An\narrangement of signals and signal appliances so interconnected that their\nmovements must succeed each other in proper sequence\".
