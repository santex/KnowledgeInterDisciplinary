{"cursor":"5629","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA few Church of Scotland congregations, mainly in the Western Isles, have\nregular Sunday services in Gaelic. There are Gaelic-speaking congregations of\nother denominations too, mainly in the Western Isles. These include the Roman\nCatholic Church, the Free Church of Scotland, the Free Church of Scotland\n(continuing), the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Associated\nPresbyterian Churches.\n\nThe list below is of Church of Scotland charges where it is desirable that the\nminister should be able to speak Gaelic. A few congregations are, however,\ndeemed to be âGaelic essentialâ. The number of congregations deemed âGaelic\ndesirableâ or âGaelic essentialâ has declined in recent decades. The Gaelic for\nâChurch of Scotlandâ is 'Eaglais na h-Alba'.\n\nThere is a shortage of ministers able to speak Gaelic. At Greyfriars Tolbooth &\nHighland Kirk in Edinburgh the services in Gaelic are now normally at 12:30 pm\nand led by an appointed preacher. The preacher's name is in the Saturday\nEdition of the Scotsman or telephone the office during normal business hours at\n0131 225 1900. However, Glasgow still has two weekly Gaelic services at St\nColumba's Church, Glasgow on St Vincent Street and Gardner Street Church of\nScotland in Partick.\n\n'Presbytery of Argyll'\n\n*Gigha and
