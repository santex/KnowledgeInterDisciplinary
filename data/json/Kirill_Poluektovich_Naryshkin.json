Kirill Naryshkinâs name was first mentioned in 1646, when he and Prince\nNikita Ivanovich Odoyevsky were dispatched to guard the southern borders of the\nMuscovy against possible attacks by the Crimean Tatars. In 1654, Kirill\nNaryshkin participated in Alexei Mikhailovichâs military campaign against Poland\nand Lithuania. In 1656, he joined Prince Yuri Baryatinsky in his Orsha campaign.\nIn 1658, Kirill Naryshkin served as head of a Streltsy unit in Smolensk. In\n1660, he was sent to the Terek region as a commander to repel the attacks of the\nrebellious Nogais. In 1662, Kirill Naryshkin was sent to Kazan to serve as a\nsecond voyevoda of Prince M.P. Shuleshov.\n\nThe tsarâs marriage to Naryshkinâs daughter Natalia Kirillovna in 1671 greatly\naffected the lives of the Naryshkins. Summoned to Moscow, Kirill Naryshkin\nattended the wedding of his daughter and then received numerous gifts and\nawards. That same year, he was conferred the title of a dumniy [[dvoryanin]]\n(3rd rank in Boyar Duma after boyars and okolnichys), only to become an\nokolnichy a year later (together with Artamon Matveev) on the day tsarevich\nPeter was born. Around the same time, Kirill Naryshkin was granted large estates\nand a very substantial salary.\n\nAgain in 1671, Naryshkin (under the command of Yuri Alexeyevich Dolgorukov)\nparticipated in the pacifying of the Nizhny Novgorod region after the Razin\nrebellion. After his raise to the rank of a boyar on November 27, 1672, Kirill\nNaryshkin never really played any significant role at the royal court or in\npolitical life of the Tsardom of Russia, only occasionally overseeing Moscow\nduring the tsarâs pilgrimages to different monasteries or trips to the\nsurrounding countryside. Naryshkin, however, held the post of a chief magistrate\nat the Grand Palace Prikaz (ÐÑÐ¸ÐºÐ°Ð· Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð´Ð²Ð¾ÑÑÐ°).\n\nDuring the reign of Feodor III of Russia, Kirill Naryshkin seems to have stopped\ntaking part in the life of the royal court (possibly, due to the intrigues of\nthe Miloslavskys), because we do not see him among guests at formal dinners or\nreceptions of foreign ambassadors. He attended, however, the Sobor of 1682,\nconvocated for the purpose of abolishing the mestnichestvo, and was among the\nones who signed its final resolution (ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾Ðµ Ð´ÐµÑÐ½Ð¸Ðµ). During the Streltsy\nUprising of 1682, Kirill Naryshkin had to suffer through several personal\ntragedies. His sons were killed during the rebellion and then he himself was\nforced by the Streltsy to take monastic vows under the name of Kiprian (Cyprian)\nand banished to Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery.\n\nUpon the enthronement of his grandson Peter I, Kirill Naryshkin could have\nreturned to the royal court, but chose to remain within the monastery walls due\nto his venerable age. He died at the monastery on April 30, 1691. His wife â\nAnna Leontyevna Naryshkina â died on July 2, 1706, and was interred at\nVysokopetrovsky Monastery.\n\n\n\n{{Persondata \n| NAME = Naryshkin, Kirill Poluektovich ALTERNATIVE NAMES =
