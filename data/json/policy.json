A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a\nprocedure<ref>Anderson, Chris. [http://www.bizmanualz.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-policies-and-\nprocedures.html What's the Difference Between Policies and Procedures?],\nBizmanualz, April 4, 2005.</ref> or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by\nthe Board of or senior governance body within an organization whereas procedures\nor protocols would be developed and adopted by senior executive officers.\nPolicies can assist in both 'subjective' and 'objective' decision making.\nPolicies to assist in subjective decision making would usually assist senior\nmanagement with decisions that must consider the relative merits of a number of\nfactors before making decisions and as a result are often hard to objectively\ntest e.g. work-life balance policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective\ndecision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested\ne.g. password policy.\n\nThe term may apply to government, private sector organizations and groups, and\nindividuals. Presidential executive orders, corporate privacy policies, and\nparliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy. Policy differs from\nrules or law. While law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring\nthe payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that\nare most likely to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nPolicy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important\norganizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives\nsuch as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of\nthe impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, management,\nfinancial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In\npublic corporate finance, a critical accounting policy is a policy for a\nfirm/company or an industry which is considered to have a notably high\nsubjective element, and that has a material impact on the financial\nstatements.'''\n","title":"policy","headings":["Impact","Policy cycle","Content","Typologies","Types","Other uses of the term","See also","Notes and references","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Privacy_policy","2: Political_science","2: Implementation","2: Distributive_tendency","2: Policy_analysis","1: Rules_of_order","1: Law","1: Policy_study","1: Critical_accounting_policy","1: California","1: Hybrid_cars","1: HOV","1: Unintended_consequences","1: Complex_adaptive_systems","1: Capital_flight","1: Laffer_curve","1: Harold_Lasswell","1: Political_agenda","1: Glyn_Davis","1: Evaluation","1: Heuristic","1: Iterative","1: Predictive","1: Postmodern","1: Overseas_Development_Institute","1: Mass_media","1: Intellectuals","1: Think_tanks","1: Policy_research_institutes","1: Promulgation","1: Ex_post_facto_law","1: Regulation","1: Governance","1: Intent","1: Public_education","1: Highways","1: Company_Policy","1: Communications_and_Information_Policy","1: Human_resource_policies","1: Public_policy","1: Defense_policy","1: Domestic_policy","1: Economic_policy","1: Education_policy","1: Energy_policy","1: Environmental_Policy","1: Foreign_policy","1: Forest_policy","1: Health_policy","1: Housing_policy","1: Information_policy","1: Macroeconomic_policy","1: Monetary_policy","1: Population_policy","1: Science_policy","1: Security_policy","1: Social_policy","1: Transportation_policy","1: Urban_planning","1: Water_policy","1: Enterprise_architecture","1: Policy_appliances","1: Information_systems","1: Insurance","1: Indemnity","1: Contract","1: Insurance_contract","1: Gambling","1: Lottery","1: Numbers_game","1: Artificial_intelligence","1: Debate","1: Policy_debate","1: Overton_window","1: Policy_alienation","1: Policy_Governance","1: Policy_studies","1: Program_evaluation","1: Public_administration","1: Public_health","1: Public_policy_schools","1: Public_services","1: Social_contract","1: Social_welfare","1: Social_work","1: Think_tank"]}
