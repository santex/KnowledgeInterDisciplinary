It was introduced by Scottish\nExecutive minister Wendy Alexander.\n\nThe Act was most notable for its repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government\nAct 1988 in Scotland, which had prevented local authorities from \"the teaching\nof the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.\" This\nrepeal was highly controversial, and Stagecoach Group founder Brian Souter led a\ncampaign against it. The bill did require that councils would, in their dealings\nwith children, have to regard the value of a stable family relationship, and\nthat any education about family life would be appropriate to the child's age and\ndevelopment.\n\nIt passed on 21 June 2000 with 99 votes for and 17 against, with 2 abstentions,\nand received Royal Assent on 4 July 2000. The Local Government Act 2003 repealed\nSection 28 in England and Wales three years later.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000","recorded":1375055877,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Government_in_Scotland%29.svg/140px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28Government_in_Scotland%29.svg.png","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Long_title","/wiki/Section_28","/wiki/Citation_of_United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/Wendy_Alexander","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1988","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id?title=Ethical+Standards+in+Public+Life+etc.+%28Scotland%29+Act+2000","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","#cite_note-1","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/wiki/Wendy_Alexander","/wiki/Section_28","/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1988","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Stagecoach_Group","/wiki/Brian_Souter","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Local_Government_Act_2003","/wiki/England_and_Wales","#Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_framework","#Standards_Commission_for_Scotland","#Chief_Investigating_Officer","#Restricted_applicability","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Code_of_Conduct","/wiki/Local_government_in_Scotland","/wiki/Councillor","/wiki/Scottish_public_body","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Non-departmental_public_body","/wiki/NHS_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Water","/wiki/Further_education","/wiki/College","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Standards_Commission_for_Scotland","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Scottish_Public_Services_Ombudsman","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-6","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Scottish_Ministers","/wiki/Scottish_Government","/w/index.php?title=Scottish_Parliamentary_Standards_Commissioner&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Public_Services_Ombudsman","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Community_council","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/wiki/Standards_Board_for_England","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-1","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2000/plain/asp_20000007_en","/wiki/Office_of_Public_Sector_Information","#cite_ref-2","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards","#cite_ref-3","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards/public-bodies","#cite_ref-4","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards/commission","#cite_ref-5","http://www.standardscommissionscotland.org.uk/protocol_ombudsman.html","#cite_ref-6","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards/cio","#cite_ref-7","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards/further-complaints","#cite_ref-8","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards/faq2","#cite_ref-9","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/local-government/ethical-standards/faq1","/w/index.php?title=Ethical_Standards_in_Public_Life_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=7","http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/7","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","/wiki/Template:UK_legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:UK_legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK_legislation&action=edit","/wiki/United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/List_of_English_statutes","/wiki/Act_of_Parliamen
