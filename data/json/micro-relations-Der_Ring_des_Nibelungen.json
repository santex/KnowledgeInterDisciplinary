{"cursor":"34868","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'' (The Ring of the Nibelung) is a cycle of four epic operas by the German\ncomposer Richard Wagner (1813â83). The works are based loosely on characters\nfrom the Norse sagas and the {{Lang|de|[[Nibelungenlied]]}}. The operas, which\nthe composer described as a trilogy with a\n{{Lang|de|[[Wikt:Vorabend|Vorabend]]}} (\"ante-evening\"), are often referred to\nas the Ring Cycle, Wagner's Ring, or simply the Ring.\n\nWagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years,\nfrom 1848 to 1874. The four operas that constitute the Ring cycle are, in\nsequence: *[[Das Rheingold]] (The Rhine Gold) *[[Die WalkÃ¼re]] (The Valkyrie)\n*[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]] *[[GÃ¶tterdÃ¤mmerung]] (Twilight of the Gods)\nAlthough individual operas of the sequence are sometimes performed separately,\nWagner intended them to be performed in series.\n","linknr":578,"url":"Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen","recorded":1362687898,"links":57,"instances":["director","voice_type","legend","music","music","music","music","director","mythology","mythology","instrument"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1876
