Historically the term comes from the Greek\nphilosophical term nous, which was translated into Latin as\n[[wikt:intellectus|intellectus]] (derived from the verb intelligere) and into\nFrench (and then English) as [[wikt:intelligence#French|intelligence]].\n\nDiscussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas. In both of\nthese areas, the terms \"intellect\" and \"intelligence\" have continued to be used\nas related words.\n\n*Intellect and [[Nous]] in philosophy. In philosophy, especially in classical\nand medieval philosophy the intellect or [[nous]] is an important subject\nconnected to the question of how humans can know things. Especially during late\nantiquity and the middle ages, the intellect was often proposed as a concept\nwhich could reconcile philosophical and scientific understandings of nature with\nmonotheistic religious understandings, by making the intellect a link between\neach human soul, and the divine intellect (or intellects) of the cosmos itself.\n(During the Latin Middle Ages a distinction developed whereby the term\n\"intelligence\" was typically used to refer to the incorporeal beings which\ngoverned the celestial spheres in many of these accounts.<ref name=Davidson>\npage 6.</ref>) Also see: passive intellect and active intellect.\n\n*Intellect and [[Intelligence]] in psychology. In modern psychology and\nneuroscience, intelligence and intellect are used as terms describing mental\nability (or abilities) that allow people to understand. A distinction is\nsometimes made whereby intellect is considered to be related to \"facts\" in\ncontrast to intelligence concerning \"feelings\".<ref>http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-consciousness-\nquestion/201205/intellect-and-intelligence</ref> Intellect refers to the\ncognition and rational mental processes gained through external input rather\nthan internal.\n\nA person who uses intelligence (thought and reason) and critical or analytical\nreasoning in either a professional or a personal capacity is often referred to\nas an intellectual.\n",
