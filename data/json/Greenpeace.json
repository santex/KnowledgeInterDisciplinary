Greenpeace\nuses direct action, lobbying and research to achieve its goals. The global\norganization does not accept funding from governments, corporations or political\nparties, relying on 2.9 million individual supporters and foundation grants. [http://www.greenpeace.org/inte-\nrnational/Global/international/publications/greenpeace/2012/AnnualReport2011.pdf\nGreenpeace, Annual Report 2011] (pdf) Greenpeace has a general\nconsultative status in the United Nations Economic and Social Council and is a founding member of the INGO\nAccountability Charter; an international non-governmental organization that\nintends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental\norganizations.\n\nGreenpeace evolved in the late 1960s from the peace movement and anti-nuclear\nprotests of the yachts Golden Rule and Phoenix of Hiroshima against the Hardtack\nseries of American nuclear tests in the Pacific in 1958. See \"Resurrecting the\nGolden Rule,\" http://www.latitude38.com/eBooks/2013/L38201303.pdf, March 2013,\npages 100-102. On September 15, 1971, the newly founded Don't Make a Wave\nCommittee sent a chartered ship, Phyllis Cormack, renamed Greenpeace for the\nprotest, from Vancouver to oppose United States testing of nuclear devices in\nAmchitka, Alaska. The Don't Make a Wave Committee subsequently adopted the name\nGreenpeace. Robert Hunter: Greenpeace to Amchitka, An\nEnvironmental Odyssey\n\nIn a few years, Greenpeace spread to several countries and started to campaign\non other environmental issues such as commercial whaling and toxic waste. In the\nlate 1970s, the different regional Greenpeace groups formed Greenpeace\nInternational to oversee the goals and operations of the regional organizations\nglobally.\nGreenpeace received international attention during the 1980s when the French\nintelligence agency bombed the [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]] in\nAuckland's Waitemata Harbour, one of the most well-known vessels operated by\nGreenpeace, killing one individual. In the following years,\nGreenpeace evolved into one of the largest environmental organizations in the\nworld.
