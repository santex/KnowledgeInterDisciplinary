The series, whose full name is the\n'Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana', consists of\ncritical editions by leading scholars (now always with a full critical apparatus\non each page, although during the nineteenth century some editiones minores were\npublished either without critical apparatuses or with abbreviated textual\nappendices).\n\n'Teubneriana' is an abbreviation used to denote mainly a single volume of the\nseries (fully: editio Teubneriana), rarely the whole collection;\ncorrespondingly, Oxoniensis is used with reference to the Scriptorum Classicorum\nBibliotheca Oxoniensis, mentioned above as Oxford Classical Texts.\n\nToday, the only comparable publishing ventures, producing authoritative\nscholarly reference editions of numerous ancient authors, are the Oxford\nClassical Texts and the Collection Budé (whose volumes also include facing-page\nFrench translations with notes). (The Loeb Classical Library, with facing-page\nEnglish translations and notes, aims at a more general audience.)\n","title":"Bibliotheca%20Teubneriana","headings":["History of the series","Greek Type in Teubner Editions","Notes","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Ancient_Greek_literature","1: Latin_literature","1: Textual_criticism","1: Critical_apparatus","1: Oxford_Classical_Texts","1: Collection_Budé","1: Loeb_Classical_Library","1: Leipzig","1: World_War_II","1: German_reunification","1: East_Germany","1: Stuttgart","1: Federal_Republic_of_Germany","1: Wiesbaden","1: Munich","1: Walter_de_Gruyter","1: Typography","1: Italic_type","1: Typesetting#Digital_era","1: Euripides","1: Orpheus#Orphic_poems_and_rites","1: Lunate_sigma","1: Alfred_Rahlfs","1: Septuaginta","1: Martin_Litchfield_West","1: Iliad"]}
