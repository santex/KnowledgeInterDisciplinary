The use of the term\ncorollary, rather than [[proposition]] or theorem, is intrinsically subjective.\nProposition B is a corollary of proposition A if B can readily be deduced from A\nor is self-evident from its proof, but the meaning of readily or self-evident\nvaries depending upon the author and context. The importance of the corollary is\noften considered secondary to that of the initial theorem; B is unlikely to be\ntermed a corollary if its mathematical consequences are as significant as those\nof A.
