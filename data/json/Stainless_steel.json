{"cursor":"30930","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn metallurgy, 'stainless steel', also known as 'inox steel' or 'inox' from\nFrench \"inoxydable\", is defined as a steel alloy with a minimum of\n10.5% to 11% chromium content by mass.\n\nStainless steel does not readily corrode, rust or stain with water as ordinary\nsteel does, but despite the name it is not fully stain-proof, most notably under\nlow oxygen, high salinity, or poor circulation environments. It is\nalso called 'corrosion-resistant steel' or 'CRES' when the alloy type and grade\nare not detailed, particularly in the aviation industry. There are different\ngrades and surface finishes of stainless steel to suit the environment the alloy\nmust endure. Stainless steel is used where both the properties of steel and\nresistance to corrosion are required.\n\nStainless steel differs from carbon steel by the amount of chromium present.\nUnprotected carbon steel rusts readily when exposed to air and moisture. This\niron oxide film (the rust) is active and accelerates corrosion by forming more\niron oxide, and due to the greater volume of the iron oxide this tends to\nflake and fall away. Stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to form a\npassive film of chromium oxide, which prevents further surface corrosion and\nblocks corrosion from spreading into the metal's internal structure, and due\nto the similar size of the steel and oxide ions they bond very strongly and\nremain attached to the surface.
