One reason is that the word \"cult\" (as\nused in the pejorative sense) is considered a subjective term, used as an ad\nhominem attack against groups with simply differing doctrines or practices, and\nwithout a clear or consistent definition.<ref>Dr. Chuck Shaw -\n[http://shawcss.tripod.com/REL101/society/sects.htm Sects and Cults] -\nGreenville Technical College - Retrieved 21 March 2013.</ref>\n\nThe word originally denoted a system of ritual practices.

In the 1970s the anticult\nmovement arose, partly motivated by acts of violence and other crimes committed\nby members of some cults. Some of the claims of the anti-cult movement have been\ndisputed by other scholars, leading to further controversies.\n\nDiscrimination against cult members has been an ongoing issue in some nations,\nas well as concerns about doomsday cults and destructive cults. Governments have\nundertaken various policies towards cults, ranging from tolerance to hostility,\nand this has also been a source of controversy.\n","title":"cult","headings":["Origins of concept in
