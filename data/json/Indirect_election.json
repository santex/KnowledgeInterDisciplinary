{"cursor":"5545","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Indirect election' is a process in which voters in an election do not choose\nbetween candidates for an office but rather elect persons who will then make the\nchoice. It is one of the oldest form of elections and is still used today for\nmany upper houses and presidents. This process is also used in many union\nelections and sometimes in professional, civic, and fraternal organizations.\n\nSome examples of indirectly elected bodies and individuals include: *the\nelection of the US President is an indirect election. Voters elect the electoral\ncollege, which then elects the President. The President of Germany is similarly\nelected by a Federal Convention convened for that purpose. India and several\nother countries have a President or other largely ceremonial head of state\nelected by their parliament. *the Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of\nEurope, OSCE, the WEU and NATO - in all of these cases, voters elect national\nparliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly\n*the German Bundesrat, where voters elect the Landtag members, who then elect\nthe state government, which then appoints its members to the Bundesrat *most\nbodies formed of representatives of national governments, e.g. the United\nNations General Assembly, can be considered indirectly elected (assuming the\nnational governments are democratically elected in the first place) *the Indian\nRajya Sabha (upper house of parliament) is indirectly elected, largely by state\nlegislatures; Manmohan Singh was a member of the Rajya Sabha but chosen by the\nmajority party in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) as the Prime\nMinister (2004- ); as such, Singh as Prime Minister had never won a direct or\npopular election; introduced as a \"technocrat\" *the United States Senate was\nindirectly elected by state legislatures until, after a number of attempts over\nthe previous century, the 17th amendment to the constitution was ratified in\n1913. *the election of the government in most parliamentary systems - the voters\nelect the parliamentarians, who then elect the government including most\nprominently the prime minister from among themselves\n\nMany countries with parliamentary systems elect their president indirectly\n(Germany, Italy, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, India, Israel).\n\nIn a Westminster system, the leader of the majority party in the parliament\nalmost always becomes the prime minister. Therefore, it could be said that the\nprime minister is elected indirectly. *in the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister\nusually is a member of the House of Commons, the lower, elected house of\nParliament\n\nIn Spain, the Congress of Deputies votes on a motion of confidence of the king's\nnominee (customarily the party leader whose party controls the Congress) and the\nnominee's political manifesto, an example of an indirect election of the Prime\nMinister of Spain.\n\nIndirect political elections have been used for lesser national offices, as\nwell. In the United States, most members of the Senate were elected by the\nlegislatures of the states until 1913, when the Seventeenth Amendment instituted\ndirect elections for those office-holders. In France, election to the upper\nhouse of Parliament, the SÃ©nat, is indirect, with the electors (called \"grands\nÃ©lecteurs\") being local elected representatives.\n\nThe Electoral College of the United States, whose task is to elect a president,\nis a form of indirect election. However, electors rarely change their actual\nvote from their pledged vote, and this factor has never made the difference in\nan election.\n","linknr":190,"url":"Indirect_election","recorded":1375082361,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Indirect_election&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_election&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Category:Politics","/wiki/Election","/wiki/Sortition","/wiki/By-election","/wiki/Electoral_fraud","/wiki/Show_election","/wiki/Fixed-term_election","/wiki/General_election","/wiki/Midterm_election","/wiki/Primary_election","/wiki/Open_primary","/wiki/Closed_primary","/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary","/wiki/Two-round_system","/wiki/Direct_election","/wiki/Local_election","/wiki/Referendum","/wiki/Initiative","/wiki/Recall_election","/wiki/Criticisms_of_electoralism","/wiki/Anonymous_elector","/wiki/Apportionment_(politics)","/wiki/Boundary_delimitation","/wiki/Crossover_voting","/wiki/Gerrymandering","/wiki/Election_silence","/wiki/Majority-minority_district","/wiki/Nesting_(voting_districts)","/wiki/Secret_ballot","/wiki/Suffrage","/wiki/Political_party","/wiki/Voting","/wiki/Voting_system","/wiki/Elections_by_country","/wiki/List_of_the_most_recent_elections_by_country","/wiki/Supranational_electoral_calendar_2013","/wiki/National_electoral_calendar_2013","/wiki/Local_electoral_calendar_2013","/wiki/Portal:Politics","/wiki/Template:Elections","/wiki/Template_talk:Elections","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Elections&action=edit","/wiki/Election","/wiki/Candidate","/wiki/Upper_house","/wiki/Trade_union","/wiki/United_States_presidential_election","/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)","/wiki/President_of_Germany","/wiki/Federal_Convention_(Germany)","/wiki/President_of_India","/wiki/Head_of_state","/wiki/Council_of_Europe","/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe","/wiki/Western_European_Union","/wiki/NATO","/wiki/Bundesrat_(Germany)","/wiki/Landtag","/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly","/wiki/Democratically_elected","/wiki/Rajya_Sabha","/wiki/Manmohan_Singh","/wiki/Manmohan_Singh#14th_Lok_Sabha","/wiki/Technocracy","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","/wiki/Parliamentary_system","/wiki/Prime_minister","/wiki/President_of_Germany","/wiki/President_of_Italy","/wiki/President_of_Estonia","/wiki/President_of_Latvia","/wiki/President_of_Hungary","/wiki/President_of_India","/wiki/President_of_Israel","/wiki/Westminster_system","/wiki/Prime_minister","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Spain","/wiki/Congress_of_Deputies","/wiki/Motion_of_confidence","/wiki/Monarchy_of_Spain","/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)","/wiki/Political_manifesto","/wiki/Spanish_Prime_Minister","/wiki/United_States_Senate","/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","/wiki/France","/wiki/French_Senate","/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Faithless_elector","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_election&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_democracy_and_elections-related_topics","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_election&action=edit&section=2","http://www.idea.int/publications/esd/","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/91-85391-18-2","http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/es","http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf","/wiki/Federal_Elections_Commission","http://works.bepress.com/josep_colomer/3","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indirect_election&oldid=539709994","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Elections_by_type","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indirect+election&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Indirect+election","/wiki/Indirect_election","/wiki/Talk:Indirect_election","#","/wiki/Indirect_election","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_election&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Indirect_election&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Specia
