This process provides an excellent\nbonding surface for repair material and new coating applications. First\ndeveloped in Europe in the 1970s, this technology has become widely accepted for\nconcrete removal and surface preparation throughout Europe and North America.\n\nHydrodemolition is not used as much for demolition as it is for surface\nrestoration and protection projects. When concrete has deteriorated or the\nreinforcing steel has begun to corrode, it is necessary to remove any unsound\nconcrete and reinforcing bars (rebar) in order to replace it with new concrete\nand maintain the integrity of the structure. This process has also been used to\nremove sound concrete that is not compromised in any way. This may be done to\ninstall a preventive cathodic protection system, or to remove concrete in\nstructures in which vibration is a concern. Unlike jackhammers, hydrodemolition\ndoes not produce vibrations throughout a structure and therefore does not\nintroduce micro fractures.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Hydrodemolition","recorded":1362372152,"links":23,"instances":["bridge"],"pdf":["http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP_RES/docs/Reports/LatexandMicrosilica.pdf","http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP_RES/docs/Reports/LatexandMicrosilica.pdf"],"categories":["Concrete","Bridges","Building engineering"],"headings":["Applications","Structures","Safety","Related processes","See also","References","Related reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Partial-depth-removal.jpg/300px-Partial-depth-removal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2c/Hydro_column_detail.jpg/220px-Hydro_column_detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/Scarification_2_Portland.JPG/220px-Scarification_2_Portland.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aqueduct","bridge"]],"members":["aqueduct"],"related":["Concrete","Asphalt","Grout","Demolition","Rebar","Cathodic_protection","Jackhammer","Rebar","Parking_structures","Dams","Spillways","Water_treatment","Tunnels","Aqueduct_(bridge)","Nuclear_power_plant","Stadiums","Retaining_wall","Hard_hat","Bulletproof_vest","Runway","Hydraulic_mining"]}
