Recognizing hypotonia, even in early infancy, is\nusually relatively straightforward, but diagnosing the underlying cause can be\ndifficult and often unsuccessful. The long-term effects of hypotonia on a\nchild's development and later life depend primarily on the severity of the\nmuscle weakness and the nature of the cause. Some disorders have a specific\ntreatment but the principal treatment for most hypotonia of idiopathic or\nneurologic cause is physical therapy, occupational therapy for remediation,\nand/or music therapy.\n\nHypotonia is thought to be associated with the disruption of afferent input\nfrom stretch receptors and/or lack of the cerebellumâs facilitatory efferent\ninfluence on the fusimotor system, the system that innervates intrafusal\nmuscle fibers thereby controlling muscle spindle sensitivity.

On examination a diminished\nresistance to passive movement will be noted and muscles may feel abnormally\nsoft and limp on palpation. Diminished deep tendon\nreflexes also may be noted.\n\nHypotonia is a condition that can be helped with early intervention.\n","linknr":467,"url":"Hypotonia","recorded":1362503057,"links":24,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cerebral palsy types","Symptoms and signs"],"headings":["Etiology of hypotonia","Signs and objective manifestations","Diagnosis","Prognosis and treatment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chronic","medicine"]],"members":["chronic"],"related":["Muscle_tone","Motor_nerve","Brain","Infancy","Medical_diagnosis","Physical_therapy","Occupational_therapy","Genetic_disorder","Down_syndrome","22q13_deletion_syndrome","3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA_carboxylase_deficiency","Achondroplasia","Aicardi_syndrome","Canavan_disease","Centronuclear_myopathy","Central_core_disease","Cohen_Syndrome","Dejerine_Sottas_syndrome","Familial_dysautonomia","FG_syndrome","Fragile_X_syndrome","Griscelli_syndrome","Infantile_spinal_muscular_atrophy","Werdnig-Hoffman_disease","Krabbe_disease","Leigh's_disease","Marfan's_syndrome","Menkes_syndrome","Methylmalonic_acidemia","Myotonic_dystrophy","Niemann-Pick_disease","Nonketotic_hyperglycinemia","Glycine_encephalopathy","Prader-Willi_syndrome","Rett_syndrome","Septo-optic_dysplasia","Spinal_Muscular_Atrophy","Succinic_semialdehyde_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Tay-Sachs_disease","Trisomy_13","Williams_syndrome","Developmental_disability","Ataxia","Sensory_integration_dysfunction","Developmental_dyspraxia","Hypothyroidism","Cerebral_palsy","Teratogenesis","Benzodiazepines","Muscular_dystrophy","Myotonic_dystrophy","Metachromatic_leukodystrophy","Rett_Syndrome","Spinal_Muscular_Atrophy","Infection","Encephalitis","Guillain-Barré_syndrome","Infant_botulism","Meningitis","Poliomyelitis","Sepsis","Toxins","Acrodynia","Mercury_poisoning","Autoimmunity","Myasthenia_gravis","Celiac_Disease","Metabolic_disorder","Hypervitaminosis","Kernicterus","Rickets","Neurological","Traumatic_brain_injury","Shaken_Baby_Syndrome","Lower_motor_neuron_lesion","Upper_motor_neuron_lesion","Central_nervous_system","Cerebral_palsy","Hypothyroidism","Sandifer_syndrome","Ligament","Head","Chronic_(medicine)","Ataxia","Breastfeeding","Motor_skills","Gross_motor_skills","Fine_motor_skills","Speech_delay","Mental_retardation","Body_building","Neurology","Muscle_tone","Stretching","Biceps","Muscle_contraction","Computerized_tomography","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Electroencephalogram","Blood_test","Genetic_testing","Karyotype","Lumbar_puncture","Electromyography","Biopsy","Hydrocephalus","National_Institute_of_Neurological_Disorders_and_Stroke","Electrical_Muscle_Stimulation","Sign_language","Hypertonia"]}
