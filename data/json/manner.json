The corporation, founded in 1890, produces a wide\nassortment of confectionery products. These include wafers, long-life\nconfectionery, chocolate-based confectionery, sweets, cocoa and a variety of\nseasonal products.\n\nThe company's best-known product are the \"Neapolitan wafers\", introduced in\n1898. They are sold in blocks of ten 47 x 17 x 17&nbsp;mm hazelnut-cream filled\nwafers. The hazelnuts were originally imported from the Naples region in Italy,\nhence the name. The basic recipe has remained unchanged to this day.\n\nThe company logo is a picture of St Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. This dates\nback to the 1890s, when Josef Manner opened his first shop right next to the\nCathedral. There is an agreement between the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of\nVienna and the Manner Company whereby the latter is allowed the use of the logo\nin return for paying the wages of one stonemason doing repair work on the\nCathedral.\n","title":"manner","headings":["Popular culture","See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Confectionery","1: Austria","1: Neapolitan_wafer","1: Naples","1: Stephansdom","1: Vienna","1: Archdiocese","1: Wafer","1: Cameo_appearance","1: Arnold_Schwarzenegger","1: Television_commercial","1: Central_Perk","1: Friends","1: Hubertus_Von_Hohenlohe","1: 2010_Winter_Olympics","1: St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna"]}
