Since a sequence of operations\ncan be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.\n\nConventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element,\ntypically a central processing unit (CPU) and some form of memory. The\nprocessing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing\nand control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored\ninformation. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an\nexternal source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.\n\nThe first electronic digital computers were developed between 1940 and 1945.\nOriginally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as\nseveral hundred modern personal computers (PCs).<ref>In 1946, ENIAC required an\nestimated 174&nbsp;kW. By comparison, a modern laptop computer may use around\n30&nbsp;W; nearly six thousand times less. </ref> In this era mechanical analog\ncomputers were used for military applications.\n\nModern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times\nmore capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the\nspace.<ref>Early computers such as Colossus and ENIAC were able to process\nbetween 5 and 100 operations per second. A modern “commodity” microprocessor (as\nof 2007) can process billions of operations per second, and many of these\noperations are more complicated and useful than early computer operations.\n{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/cd/channel/reseller/asmo-\nna/eng/products/mobile/processors/core2duo_m/feature/index.htm |title=Intel\nCore2 Duo Mobile Processor: Features |publisher=Intel Corporation |accessdate=20\nJune 2009}}</ref> Simple computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices,\nand mobile computers can be powered by small batteries. Personal computers in\ntheir various forms are icons of the Information Age and are what most people\nthink of as “computers.” However, the embedded computers found in many devices\nfrom MP3 players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the\nmost numerous.\n","title":"Computer","headings":["History of computing","Programs","Components","Misconceptions","Further topics","See
