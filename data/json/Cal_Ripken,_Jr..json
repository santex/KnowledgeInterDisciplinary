A 19-time All-Star and two-time\n  American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP), Ripken is perhaps best known\n  for breaking Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played, a record that\n  had stood for 56 years and many deemed unbreakable. Ripken surpassed the mark\n  on September 6, 1995 by playing his 2,131st consecutive game, which\n  fans later voted the \"Most Memorable Moment\" in MLB history. Ripken\n  voluntarily ended his 17-year streak at 2,632 games in 1998. One of\n  his position's most offensively productive players, Ripken tallied 3,184 hits,\n  431 home runs, and 1,695 runs batted in during his career, and he won two Gold\n  Glove Awards for his defense.\n\nRipken is considered one of the best shortstops and third basemen in baseball\nhistory. At (1.93 m), 225 lb. (102.27 kg), he pioneered the way\nfor taller, larger shortstops to be successful at those\npositions. When inducted into\nthe National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007, he was a first ballot inductee with\nthe third-highest voting percentage (98.53%) in Hall of Fame history, behind Tom\nSeaver (98.84%) and Nolan Ryan (98.79%).\n\nHe is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball,\nInc., whose goal is to grow the love of baseball from a more\ngrassroots level. Established in 2001, Ripken Baseball represents Cal's and his\nbrother Billy's business and philanthropy dealings and focuses on several subsidiaries: Ripken\nManagement and Design, Youth Camps and Clinics, Cal Ripken, Sr. foundation,\nRipken Professional Baseball, with three minor-league teamsâthe Aberdeen\nIronBirds (affiliated with the Orioles); the Augusta GreenJackets\n(affiliated with the San Francisco Giants); and the Charlotte Stone\nCrabs (affiliated with the Tampa Bay Rays).
