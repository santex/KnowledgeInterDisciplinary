{"cursor":"1761","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nstomp box sounds like a kick-drum and can be used as a trigger.]] A 'trigger\npad' is an electronic sensor on a drum  that produces a certain sound\nassigned from a sound module once the head has been struck. This device allows\ndrummers to play at a constant dynamic regardless of the physical force used.\n\nTriggers are also used to add more definition to drum sounds and prevent\nbleeding between sound sources, making it easier to hear clearly every drum\nhit without rumble or excessive cymbals. An example is where very rapid bass\ndrum hits become difficult to distinguish or even hear in the presence of a\nfull band.\n","linknr":96,"url":"Trigger_pad","recorded":1362560396,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drum kit components"],"headings":["Other uses","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cc/Footonstompbox.jpg/220px-Footonstompbox.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Stomp_box","Drum","Sound_module","Bass_drum","Mike_Portnoy","Tim_Waterson","Guinness_Book_of_World_Records","MIDI"]}
