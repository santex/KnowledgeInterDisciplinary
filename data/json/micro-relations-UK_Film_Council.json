It\nwas constituted as a private company limited by guarantee governed by a board of\n15 directors and was funded through sources including the National Lottery. John\nWoodward was the Chief Executive Officer of the UKFC. As at 30 June 2008, the\ncompany had 90 full-time members of staff. It distributed more than\nÂ£160m of lottery money to over 900 films. [[The Guardian]], 26\nJuly 2010, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/jul/26/uk-film-council-axed\nUK Film Council axed] Lord Puttnam described the Council as \"a layer of\nstrategic glue that's helped bind the many parts of our disparate industry\ntogether.\"\n\nOn 26 July 2010 the Conservative â Liberal Democrat coalition announced that the\ncouncil would be abolished; Woodward said that the\ndecision had been taken with \"no notice and no consultation\". UKFC closed on 31 March 2011, with many of its functions passing\nto the British Film Institute.\n","linknr":808,"url":"UK_Film_Council","recorded":1362582077,"links":24,"instances":["director","uk_film_council_funding_scheme","uk_film_council_funding_scheme","uk_film_council_funding_scheme","production_company","uk","united_kingdom","uk_film_council_funding_scheme"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cinema of the United Kingdom","Film organisations in the United Kingdom","Arts organisations based in the United Kingdom","Defunct public bodies of the United Kingdom","Department for Culture, Media and Sport","2000 establishments in the United Kingdom","Organizations established in 2000","2011 disestablishments in the United Kingdom","Organizations disestablished in 2011"],"headings":["Objectives","Activities","Response to abolition","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/UK_Film_Council_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/UKfilm.svg/100px-UKfilm.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["labour_party","uk"],["national_lottery","united_kingdom"],["united_kingdom_coalition_government","2010–present"],["the_bureau","production_company"],["the_magic_hour","uk_film_council_funding_scheme"],["blank_slate","uk_film_council_funding_scheme"],["digital_shorts","uk_film_council_funding_scheme"],["digital_nation","uk_film_council_funding_scheme"],["daniel_barber","director"]],"members":["united_kingdom_coalition_government","daniel_barber","blank_slate","digital_shorts","the_magic_hour","the_bureau","labour_party","national_lottery","digital_nation"],"related":["Stewart_Till","Non-departmental_public_body","Labour_Party_(UK)","Board_of_directors","National_Lottery_(United_Kingdom)","Lord_Puttnam","United_Kingdom_coalition_government_(2010–present)","British_Film_Institute","Jane_Campion","Andrea_Arnold","Sam_Taylor_Wood","Matt_Greenhalgh","Cinema_Extreme","The_Bureau_(production_company)","UK_Film_Council_Completion_Fund","Maya_Vision_International","The_Magic_Hour_(UK_Film_Council_funding_scheme)","104_films","Blank_Slate_(UK_Film_Council_funding_scheme)","B3_Media","Regional_screen_agencies","National_screen_agencies","Digital_Shorts_(UK_Film_Council_funding_scheme)","Digital_Nation_(UK_Film_Council_funding_scheme)","Armando_Iannucci","Mike_Leigh","Skillset","Regional_screen_agencies","Regional_Development_Agency","Scottish_Screen","Northern_Ireland_Screen","Film_Agency_for_Wales","British_Film_Institute","James_McAvoy","Emily_Blunt","Pete_Postlethwaite","Damian_Lewis","Timothy_Spall","Daniel_Barber_(director)","Ian_Holm","Clint_Eastwood","Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer","George_Osborne","Michael_Winner","Julian_Fellowes","Academy_Award","British_Film_Institute","Northern_Ireland_Screen","Scottish_Screen"]}
