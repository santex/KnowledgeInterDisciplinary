He and FranÃ§ois\nJacob showed that the living cell controls its manufacture of proteins through a\nfeedback mechanism analogous to a thermostat. Born in\nParis, he was also awarded several other honours and distinctions, among them\nthe LÃ©gion d'honneur. Monod (along with FranÃ§ois Jacob) is famous for his work\non the Lac operon. Study of the control of expression of genes in the Lac operon\nprovided the first example of a transcriptional regulation system. He also\nsuggested the existence of mRNA molecules that link the information encoded in\nDNA and proteins. Monod is widely regarded as one of the founders of molecular\nbiology.\n","linknr":328,"url":"Jacques_Monod","recorded":1362901129,"links":53,"instances":["military","biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1965/monod-lecture.pdf"],"categories":["Collège de France faculty","French microbiologists","French geneticists","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","French Nobel laureates","French atheists","French Resistance members","1910 births","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","1976 deaths","Scientists from Paris","Burials at the Cimetière du Grand Jas","Signers of the Humanist Manifesto"],"headings":["Personal life","Professional life","Bibliography","Quotations","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Jacques_Monod_nobel.jpg/200px-Jacques_Monod_nobel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["jeffries_wyman","1901-1995"],["cell","biology"],["chief_of_staff","military"]],"members":["chief_of_staff","cell","transcription","jeffries_wyman"],"related":["Paris,_France","France","Paris,_France","Biology","Molecular_biology","Lac_operon","Allosteric_regulation","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Atheist","French_people","Biology","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","François_Jacob","Andre_Lwoff","Paris","Légion_d'honneur","Lac_operon","Gene","Transcription_(genetics)","MRNA","DNA","Proteins","Molecular_biology","United_States","Milwaukee","Huguenot","Cannes","University_of_Paris","George_Teissier","André_Lwoff","Boris_Ephrussi","Enzymology","Allostery","Jeffries_Wyman_(1901-1995)","Jean-Pierre_Changeux","Diauxie","Bacterium","Lac_operon","Cell_(biology)","Lactose","Glucose","Negative_gene_regulation","Regulatory_induction","Frédéric_Monod","Adolphe_Monod","Humanist_Manifesto_II","Philosophy_of_science","Chief_of_staff_(military)","Forces_Françaises_de_l'Interieur","World_War_II","Leukemia","Cimetière_du_Grand_Jas","Cannes","French_Riviera","Francois_Jacob","France","Paris,_France","Paris,_France"]}
