{"cursor":"11115","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]]\n\n'Terpenes' ( ) are a large and diverse class of organic compounds, produced by a\nvariety of plants, particularly conifers, [http://www.m-\nw.com/dictionary/Terpene Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary] though also by\nsome insects such as termites or swallowtail butterflies, which emit terpenes\nfrom their osmeteria. They are often strong smelling and thus may have had a\nprotective function.\n\nThey are the major components of resin, and of turpentine produced from resin.\nThe name \"terpene\" is derived from the word \"turpentine\". In addition to their\nroles as end-products in many organisms, terpenes are major biosynthetic\nbuilding blocks within nearly every living creature. Steroids, for example, are\nderivatives of the triterpene squalene.\n\nWhen terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of\nthe carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as\nterpenoids. Some authors will use the term terpene to include all terpenoids.\nTerpenoids are also known as isoprenoids.\n\nTerpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential oils of\nmany types of plants and flowers. Essential oils are used widely as natural\nflavor additives for food, as fragrances in perfumery, and in traditional and\nalternative medicines such as aromatherapy. Synthetic variations and derivatives\nof natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas\nused in perfumery and flavors used in food additives. Vitamin A is an example of\na terpene.\n\nTerpenes are released by trees more actively in warmer weather, acting as a\nnatural form of cloud seeding. The clouds reflect sunlight, allowing the forest\nto regulate its temperature.\n\nThe aroma and flavor of hops, highly desirable in some beers, comes from\nterpenes. Of the terpenes in hops myrcene, b-pinene, b-caryophyllene, and a-\nhumulene are found in the largest quantities.
