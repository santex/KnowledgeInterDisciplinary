{"cursor":"54908","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Natural gas' is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting\nprimarily of methane, with other hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and\nhydrogen sulfide. Natural gas is an energy source often used for\nheating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as fuel for\nvehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other\ncommercially important organic chemicals.\n\nNatural gas is found in deep underground natural rock formations or associated\nwith other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates.\nPetroleum is also another resource found in proximity to and with natural gas.\nMost natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and\nthermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs,\nlandfills, and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature\nand pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.

The by-products of processing include ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes,\nand higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (which may be\nconverted into pure sulfur), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium\nand nitrogen.\n\nNatural gas is often informally referred to simply as 'gas', especially when\ncompared to other energy sources such as oil or coal.\n","linknr":920,"url":"Natural_gas","recorded":1362508859,"links":113,"instances":["element","unit","unit","cooking","fuel"],"pdf":["http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf","http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf","http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wwsystem.pdf","http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/wwsystem.pdf","https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iea.org%2Fweo%2Fdocs%2Fweo2011%2FWEO2011_GoldenAgeofGasReport.pdf","http://www.axens.net/upload/presentations/fichier/axens_gpagcc_2004v2.pdf","http://www.axens.net/upload/presentations/fichier/axens_gpagcc_2004v2.pdf","http://www.spe.org/specma/binary/files/5804785Syn10682.pdf","http://lnglicensing.conocophillips.com/NR/rdonlyres/B78B6727-E5F4-4505-B9C3-96CC94D7B30D/7357/AICHELNGNGLIntegrationPaper.pdf","http://www.nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/eta/PES_2011_Herberg.pdf","http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/116/6/V116.N06.A05.pdf"],"categories":["Natural
