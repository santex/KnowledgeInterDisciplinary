The\ninactive X chromosome is silenced by it being packaged in such a way that it has\na transcriptionally inactive structure called heterochromatin. As female mammals\nhave two X chromosomes, X-inactivation causes them not to have twice as many X\nchromosome gene products as males, which only possess a single copy of the X\nchromosome (see dosage compensation). The choice of which X chromosome will be\ninactivated is random in placental mammals such as mice and humans, but once an\nX chromosome is inactivated it will remain inactive throughout the lifetime of\nthe cell and its descendants in the organism. Unlike the random X-inactivation\nin placental mammals, inactivation in marsupials applies exclusively to the\npaternally derived X chromosome.\n","linknr":448,"url":"X-inactivation","recorded":1362374359,"links":32,"instances":["gene","genetics","genetics","genetics","genetics","gene"],"pdf":["http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/127/11/2283.pdf","http://dev.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/127/11/2283.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular genetics","Genetics","Epigenetics","Females","Sex"],"headings":["History","Mechanism","Uses in experimental biology","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/6-year_old_tortoise_shell_cat.jpg/220px-6-year_old_tortoise_shell_cat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Sd4hi-unten-crop.jpg/220px-Sd4hi-unten-crop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/BarrBodyBMC_Biology2-21-Fig1clip293px.jpg/220px-BarrBodyBMC_Biology2-21-Fig1clip293px.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/XistRNADNAFISH.jpg/220px-XistRNADNAFISH.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["imprinting","genetics"],["mosaic","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["jpx","gene"],["ftx","gene"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["jpx","mosaic","imprinting","translation","transcription","ftx"],"related":["Calico_cat","Alleles","DAPI","Histone","Fluorescence_in_situ_hybridization","Xist","DAPI","X_chromosome","Female","Mammal","Heterochromatin","Female_mammals","Gene_product","Male","Dosage_compensation","Eutheria","Mouse","Human","Marsupial","Susumu_Ohno","Autosomes","Mary_F._Lyon","Heterozygous","Gene","Ernest_Beutler","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase","Lyon_Law","European_Molecular_Biology_Organization","Imprinting_(genetics)","Mammalian_embryogenesis","Embryo","Extraembryonic_tissue","Placenta","Blastocyst","Tortoiseshell_cat","Heterozygous","Sex_linkage","Mosaic_(genetics)","Genotype","Epigenetics","Genotype","Skewed_X-inactivation","Skewed_X-inactivation","X-linked","Germline","Oocyte","Necessary_and_sufficient","Chromosomal_translocation","Autosome","Translation_(genetics)","RNA","Xist","Jpx_(gene)","Ftx_(gene)","Regulatory_protein","Xist","NcRNA","Gene_expression","Gene_silencing","Antisense","Transcription_(genetics)","DNA","Heterochromatin","DNA_methylation","Histone_acetylation","Histone_H3","Histone_methylation","H2AFY","Nucleosome","Euchromatin","Barr_body","Cell_nucleus","DNA_replication","Cell_cycle","Y_chromosome","Pseudoautosomal","Autosome","Pseudoautosomal_region","Turner_syndrome","Klinefelter_syndrome","Long_non-coding_RNA","Stanley_Michael_Gartler","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase","Sex-determination_system","Dosage_compensation","Barr_body","Heterochromatin","Epigenetics","Skewed_X-inactivation"]}
