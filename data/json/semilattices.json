Dually, a 'meet-semilattice' (or 'lower semilattice') is a partially\nordered set which has a meet (or greatest lower bound) for any nonempty finite\nsubset. Every join-semilattice is a meet-semilattice in the inverse order and\nvice versa.\n\nSemilattices can also be defined algebraically: join and meet are associative,\ncommutative, idempotent binary operations, and any such operation induces a\npartial order (and the respective inverse order) such that the result of the\noperation for any two elements is the least upper bound (or greatest lower\nbound) of the elements with respect to this partial order.\n\nA lattice is a partially ordered set that is both a meet- and join-semilattice\nwith respect to the same partial order.
