Part of the Church of\nScotland and located to the southeast of Tain, Ross-shire, it continues as an\nactive parish church (united with Nigg and linked with Tarbat).\n\nThe original Fearn Abbey was established in either 1221 or 1227 by\nPremonstratensian canons from Whithorn Priory. Originally founded at \"Old Fearn\"\nnear Edderton, it was moved by 1238 to \"New Fearn\" further east, perhaps to take\nadvantage of better agricultural lands. The Abbey was rebuilt between 1338 and\n1372 on the orders of William III, Earl of Ross. Following the Reformation the\nAbbey remained in use as a parish church, but disaster struck in 1742 when the\nflagstone roof collapsed during a service killing many members of the\ncongregation. A new church was then built adjacent to the old ruined church, but\nit itself had fallen into a ruinous state by the early 1770s. Accordingly, part\nof the original ruined Abbey was rebuilt in 1772 and again became the parish\nchurch as part of the Established Church of Scotland.\n\nThe current building thus substantially dates from 1772, but incorporating parts\nof the medieval structure. It was restored by Ian G. Lindsay & Partners in 1971.\nFurther restoration was carried out in 2002-3 under the auspices of Historic\nScotland. The current minister (since 2006) is the Rev. David V. Scott.\n\nThe congregation of Fearn Abbey meet at 11.30 each Sunday morning for worship\nand at other times for prayer and bible study. They take part in outreach work\nin the local area and have active links to the Church of Scotland's World\nMission projects in Ekwendeni, Malawi and Tabeetha School, Israel.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Fearn_Abbey","recorded":1375066464,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:TarbatTrip_020.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/TarbatTrip_020.jpg/250px-TarbatTrip_020.jpg","/wiki/Religious_order","/wiki/Premonstratensian","/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries","/wiki/Whithorn_Priory","/wiki/Diocese","/wiki/Diocese_of_Ross","/wiki/Fearchar,_Earl_of_Ross","/w/index.php?title=Finlay_McFaed&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/File:TarbatTrip_017.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/TarbatTrip_017.jpg/220px-TarbatTrip_017.jpg","/wiki/File:TarbatTrip_017.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Tain","/wiki/Ross-shire","/wiki/Premonstratensian","/wiki/Whithorn_Priory","/wiki/Edderton","/wiki/Uilleam_III,_Earl_of_Ross","/wiki/Earl_of_Ross","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Historic_Scotland","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Abbot_of_Fearn","/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0861532929","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=edit&section=3","http://www.geograph.org.uk/photos/04/21/042137_90705cec.jpg","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Fearn_Abbey&params=57_46_12.29_N_3_57_22.09_W_source:nlwiki_region:GB_scale:3125_type:landmark","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&oldid=566149150","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Listed_monasteries_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Premonstratensian_monasteries_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Listed_churches_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Christianity_in_medieval_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Highland_(council_area)","/wiki/Category:Churches_in_Highland_(council_area)","/wiki/Category:History_of_the_Scottish_Highlands","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland_churches_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Category_A_listed_buildings_in_Highland_(council_area)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fearn+Abbey&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Fearn+Abbey","/wiki/Fearn_Abbey","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Fearn_Abbey&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Fearn_Abbey","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Fearn_Abbey","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Fearn_Abbey","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&oldid=566149150","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2582427","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Fearn_Abbey&id=566149150","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Fearn+Abbey","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Fearn+Abbey&oldid=566149150&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Fearn_Abbey&printable=yes","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearn_Abbey","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2582427#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us",
