{"cursor":"5086","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Edward Vermilye Huntington' (April 26 1874, Clinton, New York, USANovember 25,\n1952, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) was an American mathematician.\n\nEdward Vermilye Huntington was awarded the B.A. and the M.A. by Harvard\nUniversity in 1895 and 1897, respectively. After two years' teaching at Williams\nCollege, he began a doctorate at the University of Strasbourg, which was awarded\nin 1901. He then spent his entire career at Harvard, retiring in 1941. He taught\nin the engineering school, becoming Professor of Mechanics in 1919. Although\nHuntington's research was mainly in pure mathematics, he valued teaching\nmathematics to engineering students. He advocated mechanical calculators and had\none in his office. He had an interest in statistics, unusual for the time, and\nworked on statistical problems for the USA military during World War I.\n\nHuntington's primary research interest was the foundations of mathematics. He\nwas one of the \"American postulate theorists\" (the term is Scanlan's),\nAmerican mathematicians active early in the 20th century (including E. H.\nMoore and Oswald Veblen) who proposed axiom sets for a variety of mathematical\nsystems. In so doing, they helped found what are now known as metamathematics\nand model theory.\n\nHuntington was perhaps the most prolific of the American postulate theorists,\ndevising sets of axioms (which he called \"postulates\") for groups, abelian\ngroups, geometry, the real number field, and complex numbers. His 1902\naxiomatization of the real numbers has been characterized as \"one of the first\nsuccesses of abstract mathematics\" and as having \"filled the last gap in the\nfoundations of Euclidean geometry\". Huntington\nexcelled at proving axioms independent of each other by finding a sequence of\nmodels, each one satisfying all but one of the axioms in a given set. His 1917\nbook The Continuum and Other Types of Serial Order was in its day \"...a widely\nread introduction to Cantorian set theory.\" (Scanlan 1999) Yet Huntington and\nthe other American postulate theorists played no role in the rise of axiomatic\nset theory then taking place in continental Europe.\n\nIn 1904, Huntington put Boolean algebra on a sound axiomatic foundation. He\nrevisited Boolean axiomatics in 1933, proving that Boolean algebra required but\na single binary operation (denoted below by infix '+') that commutes and\nassociates, and a single unary operation, complementation, denoted by a postfix\nprime. The only further axiom Boolean algebra requires is:\n\n:(a '+b ')'+(a '+b)' = a,\n\nnow known as 'Huntington's axiom'.\n\nRevising a method from Joseph Adna Hill, Huntington is credited with the 'Method\nof Equal Proportions' or Huntington-Hill method of apportionment of seats in the\nU.S. House of Representatives to the states, as a function of their populations\ndetermined in the U.S.\ncensus[http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/apportion2.html]. This\nmathematical algorithm has been used in the U.S. since 1941 and is currently the\nmethod used.\n\nIn 1919, Huntington was the third President of the Mathematical Association of\nAmerica, which he helped found as a charter member and its first vice-\npresident. [http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/huntington.html MAA\npresidents: E. V. Huntington] He was elected to the American Academy of\nArts and Sciences in 1913, and to the American Philosophical Society in 1933.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Edward_Vermilye_Huntington","recorded":1364060007,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Clinton,_Oneida_County,_New_York","/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Mathematician","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Williams_College","/wiki/University_of_Strasbourg","/wiki/Statistics","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics","/wiki/E._H._Moore","/wiki/Oswald_Veblen","/wiki/Metamathematics","/wiki/Model_theory","/wiki/Axiom","/wiki/Group_(mathematics)","/wiki/Abelian_group","/wiki/Geometry","/wiki/Real_number_field","/wiki/Complex_number","#cite_note-foundations-1","/wiki/Model_theory","/wiki/Georg_Cantor","/wiki/Set_theory","/wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory","/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(logic)","/wiki/Binary_operation","/wiki/Infix_notation","/wiki/Unary_operation","/wiki/Complement_(order_theory)","/wiki/Joseph_Adna_Hill","/wiki/Huntington-Hill_method","/wiki/Congressional_apportionment","/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives","/wiki/U.S._census","http://www.ams.org/featurecolumn/archive/apportion2.html","/wiki/Mathematical_Association_of_America","#cite_note-2","/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-foundations_1-0","/wiki/John_Wiley_%26_Sons","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-471-25183-6","#cite_ref-2","http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/huntington.html","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&action=edit&section=2","http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Huntington.html","http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/people/","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/37155104","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&oldid=544357985","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1874_births","/wiki/Category:1952_deaths","/wiki/Category:Harvard_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Williams_College_faculty","/wiki/Category:University_of_Strasbourg_alumni","/wiki/Category:Harvard_University_faculty","/wiki/Category:Presidents_of_the_Mathematical_Association_of_America","/wiki/Category:American_mathematicians","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edward+Vermilye+Huntington&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Edward+Vermilye+Huntington","/wiki/Edward_Vermilye_Huntington","/wiki/Talk:Edward_Vermilye_Huntington","#","/wiki/Edward_Vermilye_Huntington","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Edward_Vermilye_Huntington","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Edward_Vermilye_Huntington","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&oldid=544357985","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&id=544357985","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Edward+Vermilye+Huntington","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Edward+Vermilye+Huntington&oldid=544357985&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Vermilye_Huntington&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Vermilye_Huntington","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Ve
