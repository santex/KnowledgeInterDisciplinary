The album sees the band expanding on the\nmix of rock, blues, and world music found in their previous albums by adding\nelectronic instruments and recording techniques to their repertoire.\n\nWhile still using several exotic instruments and maintaining the \"eastern\"\ninfluence in the recording, many songs also include samples, sequencers, and\nloops alongside the traditional acoustic instruments. The result is a harder,\nindustrial sound. The album makes lyrical references to the afterlife\n(\"Psychopomp\"), dystopian works of Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Yevgeny\nZamyatin (\"Army Ants\") and Giovanni Piranesi's 'Imaginary Prisons' (\"Alarum\").\n\nTransmission continued to build on the momentum generated by [[The Edges of\nTwilight]], reaching double platinum status in Canada and receiving a 1998 Juno\nnomination for \"Blockbuster Rock Album of the Year\". An edited version of the\nsong \"Temptation\", as well as an instrumental version of \"Babylon\", can also be\nfound on the PlayStation game Road Rash 3D, from the same year.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Transmission_(album)","recorded":1362673156,"links":17,"instances":["song","the_tea_party_song","music","canadian_musician","the_tea_party_song","the_tea_party_song","song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The Tea Party albums","1997 albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Singles","Recording personnel","Art details","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Transmissionalbum.jpg/220px-Transmissionalbum.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["jeff_martin","canadian_musician"],["sampling","music"],["psychopomp","song"],["temptation","the_tea_party_song"],["babylon","the_tea_party_song"],["temptation","the_tea_party_song"],["psychopomp","song"],["gyroscope","song"],["release","the_tea_party_song"],["babylon","the_tea_party_song"],["temptation","the_tea_party_song"],["babylon","the_tea_party_song"],["release","the_tea_party_song"],["psychopomp","song"],["gyroscope","song"],["jeff_martin","canadian_musician"]],"members":["gyroscope","release","sampling","jeff_martin","babylon","temptation","psychopomp"],"related":["Album","The_Tea_Party","Montreal","Los_Angeles","Rock_music","EMI_Records","Atlantic_Records","Jeff_Martin_(Canadian_musician)","Allmusic","The_Tea_Party","1997_in_music","Rock_music","Blues","World_music","Sampling_(music)","Music_sequencer","Music_loops","Industrial_music","Psychopomp_(song)","Dystopian","Aldous_Huxley","George_Orwell","Yevgeny_Zamyatin","Giovanni_Piranesi","Platinum_album","Juno_Awards","Temptation_(The_Tea_Party_song)","Babylon_(The_Tea_Party_song)","PlayStation","Road_Rash_3D","Temptation_(The_Tea_Party_song)","Psychopomp_(song)","Gyroscope_(song)","Release_(The_Tea_Party_song)","Babylon_(The_Tea_Party_song)","Pregap","Instrumental","Temptation_(The_Tea_Party_song)","Babylon_(The_Tea_Party_song)","Release_(The_Tea_Party_song)","White_Ribbon_Campaign","Psychopomp_(song)","Gyroscope_(song)","Jeff_Martin_(Canadian_musician)","Montreal","Los_Angeles","Los_Angeles","Portland,_Maine","Stuart_Chatwood","Stuart_Chatwood"]}
