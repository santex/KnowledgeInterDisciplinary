In the medical field, it is\nsynonymous with the word \"treatment\". Among psychologists, the term may refer\nspecifically to psychotherapy or \"talk therapy\".\n\n'Preventive therapy' or 'prophylactic therapy' is a treatment that is intended\nto prevent a medical condition from occurring. For example, many vaccines\nprevent infectious diseases. An 'abortive therapy' is a treatment that is\nintended to stop a medical condition from progressing any further. A medication\ntaken at the earliest signs of a disease, such as at the very symptoms of a\nmigraine headache, is an abortive therapy.\n\nA 'supportive therapy' is one that does not treat or improve the underlying\ncondition, but instead increases the patient's comfort. Supportive\ntreatment may be used in palliative care.\n","linknr":257,"url":"therapies","recorded":1362582367,"links":58,"instances":["alternative_medicine","medicine","medical","medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Therapy|","Pharmacology","Clinical pharmacology","Therapeutics","Drug discovery","Health policy","Medicinal chemistry","Pharmaceutical sciences"],"headings":["Adverse effects","Difference between preventions, treatments, and cures","Types of therapies","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["compliance","medicine"],["electromagnetic_therapy","alternative_medicine"],["interventionism","medicine"],["prevention","medical"]],"members":["electromagnetic_therapy","compliance","prevention","interventionism"],"related":["Medical_diagnosis","Psychotherapy","Vaccine","Palliative_care","Side_effect","Medical_error","Contraindication","Risk","Compliance_(medicine)","Body_weight","Enzyme","Pathology","Food","Drug_interaction","Preventive_medicine","Polio","Chronic_diseases","Chemotherapy","Cure","Matter","Drug","Pharmacotherapy","Chemotherapy","Mesotherapy","Medical_device","Gene","Gene_therapy","Gold","Chrysotherapy","Hormone","Hormone_therapy","Organism","Biotherapy","Virus","Virotherapy","Bacteriophage","Phage_therapy","Maggot","Maggot_therapy","Ozone","Ozonotherapy","Salt","Speleotherapy","Serous_fluid","Water","Hydrotherapy","Energy","Electric_energy","Electricity","Electrotherapy","Electromagnetic_radiation","Electromagnetic_therapy_(alternative_medicine)","Magnetic_energy","Magnet_therapy","Light","Phototherapy","Mechanics","Manual_therapy","Massotherapy","Exercise","Physiotherapy","Sound","Cymatic_therapy","Music_therapy","Radiation","Radiotherapy","Temperature","Heat","Thermotherapy","Cold","Cryotherapy","Counseling","Psychotherapy","Education","Physical_therapy","Occupational_therapy","Massage","Acupuncture","Lifestyle_medicine","Junk_food","Sleep","Meditation","Side_effects","Classification_of_Pharmaco-Therapeutic_Referrals","Cure","Interventionism_(medicine)","Inverse_benefit_law","List_of_therapies","Greyhound_therapy","Mature_minor_doctrine","Medicine","Medication","Nutraceutical","Prevention_(medical)","Psychotherapy","Therapeutic_inertia","Therapeutic_nihilism"]}
