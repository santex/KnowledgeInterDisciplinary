{"cursor":"2118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'St. Andrew's Scots Church, Malta,' is a joint congregation (a \"Local Ecumenical\nPartnership\") of the Church of Scotland and the Methodist Church of Great\nBritain. For Church of Scotland purposes it is part of the Presbytery of Europe.\nIt is the only Reformed Church in Malta (the population of which is\npredominantly Roman Catholic). Apart from the Livingston Ecumenical Parish and\nGrahamston United Church in Falkirk,Scotland, it is the only joint Methodist and\nChurch of Scotland congregation anywhere.\n\nThe church buildings are situated in the centre of Valletta at 210 Old Bakery\nStreet. The Sunday service (in English) is held at 10.30am. The building was\nformerly used solely by the Church of Scotland; the former Methodist Church\nbuilding is no longer used for worship.\n\nThe links between Methodism and Scottish Presbyterianism in Malta are\nlongstanding, despite the existence of separate congregations until recently.\nThe current church building stands on the site of the first non-Roman Catholic\nchurch to be opened on the island. This was a Methodist church opened in 1824.\nThe present building was built largely through the efforts of a Church of\nScotland minister, Rev Dr George Wiseley, and was opened in 1857. Dr Wiseley was\nminister of St Andrew's and Presbyterian Chaplain to the Forces in Malta from\n1854 to 1914. The current minister (since 2009) is Rev Doug McRoberts, a Church\nof Scotland minister, who succeeded Methodist Rev David Morris, who in 2002 had\nfollowed Rev Colin Westmarland (minister from 1975 onwards) who was the first\nminister not to be a UK military chaplain.\n\nThe church buildings are also regularly used by a German-speaking Lutheran\ncongregation, the Andreas Gemeinde.\n","linknr":84,"url":"St._Andrew's_Scots_Church,_Malta","recorded":1375066473,"links":["/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","/wiki/Methodist_Church_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Presbytery_of_Europe","/wiki/Malta","/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church","/wiki/Livingston,_West_Lothian","/wiki/Valletta","/wiki/Presbyterianism","/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&action=edit&section=1","http://www.saintandrewsmalta.com/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&oldid=532974197","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Churches_in_Malta","/wiki/Category:Church_of_Scotland_churches","/w/index.php?title=Category:Methodist_churches_in_Europe&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Category:Buildings_and_structures_in_Valletta","/wiki/Category:Presbyterian_churches_in_Europe","/wiki/Category:Malta_articles_missing_geocoordinate_data","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_coordinates","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=St.+Andrew%27s+Scots+Church%2C+Malta&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=St.+Andrew%27s+Scots+Church%2C+Malta","/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta","/wiki/Talk:St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta","#","/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta","/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&oldid=532974197","/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7586902","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church%2C_Malta&id=532974197","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=St.+Andrew%27s+Scots+Church%2C+Malta","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=St.+Andrew%27s+Scots+Church%2C+Malta&oldid=532974197&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7586902#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Andrew%27s_Scots_Church,_Malta","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Churches
