It follows the Neogene\nPeriod and spans from 2.588 Â± 0.005 million years ago to the present. The\nrelatively short period is characterized by a series of glaciations, the\nappearance and expansion of anatomically modern humans. The Quaternary includes\ntwo geologic epochs: the Pleistocene and Holocene. A proposed but as yet\ninformal third epoch, the Anthropocene, has also gained credence as the time in\nwhich humans began to profoundly affect and change the global environment,\nalthough its start date is still disputed.\n","linknr":542,"url":"quaternary","recorded":1362673375,"links":69,"instances":["journal","geologist","geology","geology","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.quaternary.stratigraphy.org.uk/correlation/POSTERSTRAT_BOREAS_v2005c.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Quaternary|","Cenozoic","Physical geography","Physical oceanography"],"headings":["Research history","Geology","Climate","Quaternary glaciation","See also","Journals relating to the Quaternary Period","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Blakey_presentmoll.jpg/240px-Blakey_presentmoll.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/IceAgeEarth.jpg/220px-IceAgeEarth.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg/110px-Land_ocean_ice_cloud_hires.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["period","geology"],["epoch","geology"],["giovanni_arduino","geologist"],["rock","geology"],["boreas","journal"]],"members":["boreas","giovanni_arduino","epoch","period","rock"],"related":["Period_(geology)","Cenozoic","Era","Geologic_time_scale","International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy","Neogene","Quaternary_glaciation","Anatomically_modern_humans","Epoch_(geology)","Pleistocene","Holocene","Anthropocene","Giovanni_Arduino_(geologist)","Po_river","Italy","Jules_Desnoyers","France","Seine","Tertiary","Period/Age","Rock_(geology)","Neogene","Glacier","Pleistocene","Holocene","Northern_Hemisphere","Pliocene","International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy","GSSP","Biostratigraphy","Paleoclimate","International_Union_for_Quaternary_Research","Cenozoic","Gelasian","Continental_drift","Bosphorus","Skagerrak","Black_Sea","Baltic_Sea","English_Channel","Bering_Strait","Scablands","Canadian_Shield","Climate","Latitude","Saber-toothed_cat","Mammoth","Mastodon","Glyptodon","Extinction","Horse","Camel","American_cheetah","North_America","Ice_Age","Switzerland","Ignaz_Venetz","Louis_Agassiz","Milankovitch_cycles","Milutin_Milankovitch","Solar_radiation","Humans","Quaternary_extinction_event","Quaternary_glaciation","Quaternary_science","List_of_Quaternary_volcanic_eruptions","Boreas_(journal)","Geografiska_Annaler","Cuaternario_y_Geomorfología","Journal_of_Quaternary_Science","Quaternary_Geochronology","Quaternary_International","Quaternary_Research","American_Quaternary_Association","Megabyte","Universidad_de_Salamanca"]}
