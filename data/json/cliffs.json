Cliffs\n are formed as erosion landforms due to the processes of erosion and weathering\n that produce them. Cliffs are common on coasts, in mountainous areas,\n escarpments and along rivers. Cliffs are usually formed by rock that is\n resistant to erosion and weathering. Sedimentary rocks most likely to form\n cliffs include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and dolomite. Igneous rocks such as\n granite and basalt also often form cliffs.\n\nAn escarpment (or scarp) is a type of cliff, formed by the movement of a\ngeologic fault, or a landslide.\n\nMost cliffs have some form of scree slope at their base. In arid areas or under\nhigh cliffs, these are generally exposed jumbles of fallen rock. In areas of\nhigher moisture, a soil slope may obscure the talus. Many cliffs also feature\ntributary waterfalls or rock shelters. Sometimes a cliff peters out at the end\nof a ridge, with tea tables or other types of rock columns remaining. Coastal\nerosion may lead to the formation of sea cliffs along a receding coastline.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey distinguishes between cliffs (continuous line along the\ntop edge with projections down the face) and outcrops (continuous lines along\nlower edge).\n\n's Rupal face, highest cliff (rock wall/mountain face) in the world. The\nsteepest part of the face lies 2km to the northeast.]]\n","title":"Cliff","headings":["Large and famous cliffs","As habitat determinants","See also","References","External
