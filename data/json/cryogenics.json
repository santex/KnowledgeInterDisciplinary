A person who studies elements that have been subjected to\nextremely cold temperatures is called a cryogenicist. Rather than the relative\ntemperature scales of Celsius and Fahrenheit, cryogenicists use the absolute\ntemperature scales. These are Kelvin (SI units) or Rankine scale (Imperial & US\nunits). The term cryogenics is often mistakenly used in fiction and popular\nculture to refer to the very different cryonics.\n",
