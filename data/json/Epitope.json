{"cursor":"5452","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'epitope', also known as 'antigenic determinant', is the part of an antigen\nthat is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or\nT cells. The part of an antibody that recognizes the epitope is called a\nparatope. Although epitopes are usually non-self proteins, sequences derived\nfrom the host that can be recognized are also epitopes.\n\nThe epitopes of protein antigens are divided into two categories, conformational\nepitopes and linear epitopes, based on their structure and interaction with the\nparatope. A conformational epitope is composed of discontinuous\nsections of the antigen's amino acid sequence. These epitopes interact with the\nparatope based on the 3-D surface features and shape or tertiary structure of\nthe antigen. Most epitopes are conformational.\n\nBy contrast, linear epitopes interact with the paratope based on their primary\nstructure. A linear epitope is formed by a continuous sequence of amino acids\nfrom the antigen.\n","linknr":270,"url":"Epitope","recorded":1362486689,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system"],"headings":["Function","Epitope mapping","Epitope tags","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Antigen","Immune_system","Antibody","B_cell","T_cell","Paratope","Protein","Conformational_epitope","Linear_epitope","Amino_acid","Tertiary_structure","Primary_structure","T_cell","Antigen-presenting_cell","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Niels_Kaj_Jerne","Epitope_mapping","Protein_microarray","ELISPOT","ELISA","Proteomics","Recombinant_DNA","Protein_biosynthesis","Myc-tag","HA-tag","FLAG-tag","GST-tag","Polyhistidine-tag","Paratope","Mimotope","Epitope_mapping","Conformational_epitope","Polyclonal_B_cell_response","Odotope","Protein_tag"]}
