It occurs as a\n  mixture in liquid and gaseous sulfur and also at cryogenic temperatures as a\n  solid. Under standard conditions it is unstable and self reacts to solid\n  sulfur S 8. The molecule shape is similar to ozone. S 3 is found in sulfur vapour, comprising 10% of\n  vapour species at 713 K (440 Â°C) and 1333 Pa (10 mmHg). It is cherry red in\n  colour, with a bent structure, similar to ozone, O 3.\n\nThe molecule has a distance between sulfur atoms of 191.7(1) pm (1.917(1) Ã) and\nangle at the central atom of 117.36(6)Â°. However, cyclic\nS 3, where the sulfur atoms are arranged in an equilateral triangle\nwith three bonds (similar to cyclic ozone), should in theory be lower in energy\nthan the bent structure actually observed.\n\nThe name Thiozone was invented by Hugo Erdmann in 1908 who hypothesized that\nS 3 made up a large proportion of liquid sulfur. However\nits existence was unproven until the experiments of J. Berkowitz in 1964. Using mass spectrometry, he showed that sulfur vapour contains\nthe S 3 molecule. Above 1200Â°C S 3 is the second most common\nmolecule after S 2 in sulfur gas. In liquid\nsulfur the molecule is not common until the temperature is high, such as 500Â°.\nHowever small molecules like this contribute to most of the reactivity of liquid\nsulfur. S 3 has an absorption peak of 425 nm\nwith a tail extending into blue light.\n\nS 3 can also be made by photolysis of S 3Cl 2\nembedded in a glass or matrix of solid noble gas.\n","linknr":244,"url":"Trisulfur","recorded":1362579408,"links":20,"instances":["moon"],"pdf":["http://www.roaldhoffmann.com/pn/modules/Downloads/docs/513s.pdf","http://www.roaldhoffmann.com/pn/modules/Downloads/docs/513s.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~vijay/Papers/Chemistry/Meyer-76.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~vijay/Papers/Chemistry/Meyer-76.pdf","http://www.icors2010.org/abstractfiles/ICORS20100099.6625VER.2.pdf","http://www.icors2010.org/abstractfiles/ICORS20100099.6625VER.2.pdf"],"categories":["Sulfur"],"headings":["Natural occurrence","Reactions","Radical anion","Trisulfide ion","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Trisulfur_schematic.svg/120px-Trisulfur_schematic.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Thiozone-CRC-MW-3D-vdW.png/120px-Thiozone-CRC-MW-3D-vdW.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Lazurite.jpg/220px-Lazurite.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["io","moon"]],"members":["io"],"related":["Ozone","Disulfur_monoxide","Allotrope_of_sulfur","Sulfur","Ozone","Ozone","Cyclic_ozone","Hugo_Erdmann","Mass_spectrometry","Io_(moon)","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_oxysulfide","Iron_carbonyl","Radical_ion","Ozonide","Lapis_lazuli","Lazurite","Ultramarine","International_Klein_Blue","Yves_Klein","Valence_isoelectronic","Ozonide","Nanometer","Electron_volt","Raman_frequency","Hydrothermal_fluid","Putrescine","Magnesium_oxide","Raman_spectroscopy","Polysulfide"]}
