It is a The height of the David was\nrecorded incorrectly and the mistake proliferated through many art history\npublications. The accurate height was only determined in 1998-1999 when a team\nfrom Stanford University went to Florence to try out a project on digitally\nimaging large 3D objects by photographing sculptures by Michelangelo and found\nthat the sculpture was taller than any of the sources had indicated.

The\nstatue represents the Biblical hero David, a favoured subject in the art of\nFlorence. See, for example, Donatello's 2 versions of David; Verrocchio's\nbronze ''David''; Domenico Ghirlandaio's painting of David; and Bartolomeo\nBellano's bronze David. Originally commissioned as one of a series of\nstatues of prophets to be positioned along the roofline of the east end of\nFlorence Cathedral, the statue was instead placed in a public square, outside\nthe Palazzo della Signoria, the seat of civic government in Florence, where it\nwas unveiled on 8 September 1504.\n\nBecause of the nature of the hero that it represented, it soon came to symbolize\nthe defence of civil liberties embodied in the Florentine Republic, an\nindependent city-state threatened on all sides by more powerful rival states and\nby the hegemony of the Medici family. The eyes of David, with a warning glare,\nwere turned towards Rome.
