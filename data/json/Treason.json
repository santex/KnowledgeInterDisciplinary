{"cursor":"47608","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n by George Cruikshank. Guy Fawkes tried to assassinate James I of England. He\n failed and was convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and\n quartered.]]\n\nIn law, 'treason' is the crime that covers some of the more extreme acts against\none's sovereign or nation. Historically, treason also covered the murder of\nspecific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife. Treason\nagainst the king was known as high treason and treason against a lesser superior\nwas petty treason. A person who commits treason is known in law as a 'traitor'.\n\nOran's Dictionary of the Law (1983) defines treason as \"...[a]...citizen's\nactions to help a foreign government overthrow, make war against, or seriously\ninjure the [parent nation].\" In many nations, it is also often considered\ntreason to attempt or conspire to overthrow the government, even if no foreign\ncountry is aiding or involved by such an endeavor.\n\nOutside legal spheres, the word \"'traitor'\" may also be used to describe a\nperson who betrays (or is accused of betraying) their own political party,\nnation, family, friends, ethnic group, team, religion, social class, or other\ngroup to which they may belong. Often, such accusations are controversial and\ndisputed, as the person may not identify with the group of which they are a\nmember, or may otherwise disagree with the group leaders making the charge. See,\nfor example, race traitor.\n\nAt times, the term \"traitor\" has been used as a political epithet, regardless of\nany verifiable treasonable action. In a civil war or insurrection, the winners\nmay deem the losers to be traitors. Likewise the term \"traitor\" is used in\nheated political discussiontypically as a slur against political dissidents, or\nagainst officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best\ninterest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the German\n[[DolchstoÃlegende]], the accusation of treason towards a large group of people\ncan be a unifying political message.\n\nIn English law, high treason was punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered\n(men) or burnt at the stake (women), or beheading (royalty and nobility).\nTreason was the only crime which attracted those penalties (until they were\nabolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively). The penalty was used by later\nmonarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors, although most\nmodern jurists would call it excessive. Many of them would now just be\nconsidered dissidents.\n\nIn William Shakespeare's play [[King Lear]] (c. 1600), when the King learns that\nhis daughter Regan has publicly dishonoured him, he says They could not, would\nnot do 't; 'tis worse than murder: a conventional attitude at that time. In\nDante Alighieri's [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], the ninth and lowest circle of\nHell is reserved for traitors; Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus, suffers the\nworst torments of all: being constantly gnawed at by one of Lucifer's own three\nmouths. His treachery is considered so notorious that his name has long been\nsynonymous with traitor, a fate he shares with Benedict Arnold, Marcus Junius\nBrutus (who too is depicted in Dante's Inferno, suffering the same fate as Judas\nalong with Cassius Longinus), and Vidkun Quisling. Indeed, the etymology of the\nword traitor originates with Judas' handing over of Jesus to the Roman\nauthorities: the word is derived from the Latin [[traditor]] which means \"one\nwho delivers.\" Christian theology and political thinking until after\nthe Enlightenment considered treason and blasphemy as synonymous, as it\nchallenged both the state and the will of God. Kings were considered chosen by\nGod and to betray one's country was to do the work of Satan. depicting VÃ¡clav\nBÄlskÃ½ (1818â1878), Mayor of Prague from 1863 until 1867, in charge of the city\nduring Prussian occupation in July 1866.
