{"cursor":"49315","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n by George Cruikshank. Guy Fawkes tried to assassinate James I of England. He\n failed and was convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and\n quartered.]]\n\nIn law, 'treason' is the crime that covers some of the more extreme acts against\none's sovereign or nation. Historically, treason also covered the murder of\nspecific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that\nof a master by his servant or slave. Treason against the king was known as high\ntreason and treason against a lesser superior was petty treason. A person who\ncommits treason is known in law as a 'traitor'.\n\nOran's Dictionary of the Law (1983) defines treason as \"...[a]...citizen's\nactions to help a foreign government overthrow, make war against, or seriously\ninjure the [parent nation].\" In many nations, it is also often considered\ntreason to attempt or conspire to overthrow the government, even if no foreign\ncountry is aiding or involved by such an endeavor.\n\nOutside legal spheres, the word \"'traitor'\" may also be used to describe a\nperson who betrays (or is accused of betraying) their own political party,\nnation, family, friends, ethnic group, team, religion, social class, or other\ngroup to which they may belong. Often, such accusations are controversial and\ndisputed, as the person may not identify with the group of which they are a\nmember, or may otherwise disagree with the group members making the charge. See,\nfor example, race traitor, often used by White supremacists and of people in inter-\nracial relationships (cf. miscegenation).\n\nAt times, the term \"traitor\" has been used as a political epithet, regardless of\nany verifiable treasonable action. In a civil war or insurrection, the winners\nmay deem the losers to be traitors. Likewise the term \"traitor\" is used in\nheated political discussiontypically as a slur against political dissidents, or\nagainst officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best\ninterest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the German\n[[DolchstoÃlegende]], the accusation of treason towards a large group of people\ncan be a unifying political message.\n\nIn English law, high treason was punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered\n(men) or burnt at the stake (women), or beheading (royalty and nobility).\nTreason was the only crime which attracted those penalties (until they were\nabolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively). The penalty was used by later\nmonarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors, although most\nmodern jurists would call it excessive. Many of them would now just be\nconsidered dissidents.\n\nIn William Shakespeare's play [[King Lear]] (c. 1600), when the King learns that\nhis daughter Regan has publicly dishonoured him, he says They could not, would\nnot do 't; 'tis worse than murder: a conventional attitude at that time. In\nDante Alighieri's [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], the ninth and lowest circle of\nHell is reserved for traitors; Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus, suffers the\nworst torments of all: being constantly gnawed at by one of Lucifer's own three\nmouths. His treachery is considered so notorious that his name has long been\nsynonymous with traitor, a fate he shares with Benedict Arnold, Marcus Junius\nBrutus (who too is depicted in Dante's Inferno, suffering the same fate as Judas\nalong with Cassius Longinus), and Vidkun Quisling (cf. quisling for the\nproverbial status of the latter's name). Indeed, the etymology of the word\ntraitor originates with Judas' handing over of Jesus to the chief priests,\ncaptains of the temple and elders( Luke 22:52): the word is derived from the\nLatin [[traditor]] which means \"one who delivers.\" Christian theology\nand political thinking until after the Enlightenment considered treason and\nblasphemy as synonymous, as it challenged both the state and the will of God.\nKings were considered chosen by God. Cf. parallels in Eastern and Oriental\ncultures, such as the Divine mandate and Mandate of Heaven. and to betray\none's country was to do the work of Satan. depicting VÃ¡clav BÄlskÃ½ (1818â1878),\nMayor of Prague from 1863 until 1867, in charge of the city during Prussian\noccupation in July 1866. Some forces wanted to try him for high treason (left:\n\"What some men wished\" â \"Dr. BÄlskÃ½ for high treason\"), but he got a full\nconfidence from the Council of Prague (right: \"but what they did not expect\" â\n\"address of confidence from the city of Prague\").]]\n","linknr":659,"url":"Treason","recorded":1374963483,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Treason_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Traitor_(disambiguation)","/wiki/File:Guy_Fawkes_by_Cruikshank.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Guy_Fawkes_by_Cruikshank.jpg/240px-Guy_Fawkes_by_Cruikshank.jpg","/wiki/File:Guy_Fawkes_by_Cruikshank.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Guy_Fawkes","/wiki/George_Cruikshank","/wiki/James_I_of_England","/wiki/Hanged,_drawn_and_quartered","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Crime","/wiki/Sovereignty","/wiki/Nation","/wiki/High_treason","/wiki/Petty_treason","/wiki/Citizenship","/wiki/Government","/wiki/War","/wiki/Betrayal","/wiki/Political_party","/wiki/Nation","/wiki/Family","/wiki/Friend","/wiki/Ethnic_group","/wiki/Team","/wiki/Religion","/wiki/Social_class","/wiki/Race_traitor","/wiki/White_supremacy","/wiki/Inter-racial_relationships","/wiki/Miscegenation","/wiki/Epithet","/wiki/Civil_war","/wiki/Insurrection","/wiki/Term_of_disparagement","/wiki/Political_dissent","/wiki/Germany","/wiki/Dolchsto%C3%9Flegende","/wiki/English_law","/wiki/High_treason","/wiki/Hanged,_drawn_and_quartered","/wiki/Execution_by_burning","/wiki/Decapitation","/wiki/Dissident","/wiki/William_Shakespeare","/wiki/King_Lear","/wiki/Regan_(King_Lear)","/wiki/Dante_Alighieri","/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)","/wiki/Hell","/wiki/Judas_Iscariot","/wiki/Jesus","/wiki/Benedict_Arnold","/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus","/wiki/Gaius_Cassius_Longinus","/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling","/wiki/Quisling","/wiki/Etymology","/wiki/Traditor","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment","/wiki/Blasphemy","/wiki/Divine_right_of_Kings","#cite_note-2","/wiki/File:Belsky_Vaclav_Cartoon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Belsky_Vaclav_Cartoon.png/220px-Belsky_Vaclav_Cartoon.png","/wiki/File:Belsky_Vaclav_Cartoon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Cartoon","/wiki/Prague","/wiki/Prussian","#In_individual_jurisdictions","#Australia","#New_South_Wales","#Victoria","#Brazil","#Canada","#France","#Hong_Kong","#Germany","#Ireland","#Italy","#New_Zealand","#Russia","#Sweden","#Switzerland","#Turkey","#United_Kingdom","#International_influence","#United_States","#Federal","#State","#Muslim_countries","#Algeria","#Bahrain","#Palestinian_territories","#List_of_people_convicted_by_country","#Related_offences","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Australian","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Overt_act","/wiki/Life_imprisonment","/wiki/Crimes_Act_1914","/wiki/Treachery_(law)","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Treason_Act_1351","/wiki/Treason_Act_1795","/wiki/Treason_Act_1817","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Treason_Act_1795","/wiki/Treason_Act_1817","/wiki/Crimes_Act_1900","#cite_note-5","/wiki/King_George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Crimes_Act_1900","/wiki/Treason_Felony_Act_1848","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Treason_Act_1351","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Treason_Felony_Act_1848","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Brazilian_law","/wiki/Federal_Republic_of_Brazil","/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Brazil","/wiki/History_of_Brazil","/wiki/Carlos_Lamarca","/wiki/Brazilian_military_dictatorship","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Criminal_Code_of_Canada","#cite_note-9","/wiki/High_treason","/wiki/Petty_treason","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/File:Degradation_alfred_dreyfus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Degradation_alfred_dreyfus.jpg/230px-Degradation_alfred_dreyfus.jpg","/wiki/File:Degradation_alfred_dreyfus.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Alfred_Dreyfus","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Euro","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Treason&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Life_imprisonment","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/w/i
