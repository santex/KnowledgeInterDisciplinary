{"cursor":"7525","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In baseball, an 'earned run' is any run for which the pitcher is held\naccountable (i.e., the run scored as a result of normal pitching, and not due\nto a fielding error or a passed ball). Any runner who tags his base and reaches\nhome plate is scored against the pitcher as an earned run. An error made by the\npitcher in fielding at his position is counted the same as an error by any\nother player.\n\nEarned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a\npitcher's earned run average â the number of earned runs allowed per 9\ninnings (regulation game) pitched. Earned runs stem from the theory that the\npitcher has sole responsibility to earn strikes against an opposing batter until\nat least three batters are retired in each inning of play, and nine innings (a\ncomplete game) are pitched.\n\nTo determine whether a run is earned, the official scorer must reconstruct the\ninning as it would have occurred without the errors (for purposes of this rule,\nthe \"errors\" also include passed balls). The benefit of the doubt is always\ngiven to the pitcher in determining which bases would have been reached by\nerrorless play.\n\nIf no errors and no passed balls occur during the inning, all runs scored are\nautomatically earned (assigned responsible to the pitcher). In a few cases, an\nerror can be rendered harmless as the inning progresses. For example, a runner\non first base advances to second on a passed ball and the next batter walks.\nSince the runner would now have been at second anyway, the passed ball no longer\nhas any impact on the earned/unearned calculation.\n","linknr":183,"url":"Earned_run","recorded":1375076342,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Pitcher","/wiki/Error_(baseball)","/wiki/Passed_ball","/wiki/Baserunning","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Batting_(baseball)","/wiki/Official_scorer","#Unearned_run","#Historical_differences","#External_links","#See_also","/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Infield_fly_rule","/wiki/Passed_ball","/wiki/Wild_pitch","/wiki/Fielder%27s_choice","/wiki/Third_baseman","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Base_hit","/wiki/Catcher%27s_interference","/wiki/Pinch-runner","/wiki/Pinch-hitter","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/List_of_baseball_jargon_(I)#inherited_runner","/wiki/Box_score_(baseball)","/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Jim_Devlin","/wiki/1876_in_baseball","/wiki/Complete_game","/wiki/Shutout","/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=edit&section=3","http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp","/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Baseball_statistics","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Run_average","/wiki/Template:Baseball_statistics","/wiki/Template_talk:Baseball_statistics","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baseball_statistics&action=edit","/wiki/Baseball_statistics","/wiki/Batting_(baseball)","/wiki/Batting_average","/wiki/On-base_percentage","/wiki/Slugging_percentage","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Single_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)","/wiki/Run_batted_in","/wiki/Game-winning_RBI","/wiki/Base_on_balls","/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)","/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt","/wiki/Sacrifice_fly","/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging","/wiki/Baserunning","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Stolen_base_percentage","/wiki/Caught_stealing","/wiki/Pitching_(baseball)","/wiki/Win%E2%80%93loss_record_(pitching)","/wiki/Pitchers_of_record","/wiki/Save_(baseball)","/wiki/Hold_(baseball)","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Base_on_balls","/wiki/Perfect_game","/wiki/No-hitter","/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched","/wiki/Quality_start","/wiki/Complete_game","/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball","/wiki/Wild_pitch","/wiki/Passed_ball","/wiki/Baseball_positions","/wiki/Fielding_percentage","/wiki/Assist_(baseball)","/wiki/Putout","/wiki/Error_(baseball)","/wiki/Fielder%27s_choice","/wiki/Defensive_indifference","/wiki/Sabermetrics","/wiki/Base_runs","/wiki/Batting_park_factor","/wiki/Catcher%27s_ERA","/wiki/Defensive_Runs_Saved","/wiki/Extrapolated_Runs","/wiki/Game_score","/wiki/Isolated_Power","/wiki/Range_factor","/wiki/Runs_created","/wiki/Secondary_average","/wiki/NERD_(sabermetrics)","/wiki/Out_of_zone_plays_made","/wiki/Ultimate_zone_rating","/wiki/WOBA","/wiki/Wins_above_replacement","/wiki/Win_probability_added","/wiki/Win_shares","/wiki/Sports_league_ranking","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&oldid=553513624","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Baseball_terminology","/wiki/Category:Pitching_statistics","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Earned+run&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Earned+run","/wiki/Earned_run","/wiki/Talk:Earned_run","#","/wiki/Earned_run","/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Earned_run&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Earned_run","/wiki/Special:Recent
