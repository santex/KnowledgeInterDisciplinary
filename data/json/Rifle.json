The raised areas of the rifling are called \"lands,\" which make contact\nwith the projectile (for small arms usage, called a bullet), imparting spin\naround an axis corresponding to the orientation of the weapon. When the\nprojectile leaves the barrel, this spin lends gyroscopic stability to the\nprojectile and prevents tumbling, in the same way that a properly thrown\nAmerican football or rugby ball behaves. This allows the use of aerodynamically-\nefficient pointed bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in muskets)\nand thus improves range and accuracy. The word \"rifle\" originally referred to\nthe grooving, and a rifle was called a \"rifled gun.\" Rifles are used in warfare,\nhunting and shooting sports.\n\nTypically, a bullet is propelled by the contained deflagration of an explosive\ncompound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose),\nalthough other means such as compressed air are used in air rifles, which are\npopular for vermin control, hunting small game, formal target shooting and\ncasual shooting (\"plinking\").\n\nIn most armed forces the term \"gun\" is incorrect when referring to small arms;\nin military parlance, the word \"gun\" refers to an artillery piece or crew-served\nmachine gun. Furthermore, in many works of fiction a rifle refers to any weapon\nthat has a stock and is shouldered before firing, even if the weapon is not\nrifled or does not fire solid projectiles (e.g. a \"laser rifle\").\n\nFormerly, rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the\ntrigger. Modern rifles are capable of firing more than one round per trigger\nsqueeze; some fire in a fully automatic mode and others are limited to fixed\nbursts of two, three, or more rounds per squeeze. Thus, modern automatic rifles\noverlap to an extent in design and function with machine guns. In fact, many\nlight machine guns (such as the Russian RPK) are adaptations of existing\nautomatic rifle designs. Generally, the difference between an automatic rifle\nand a machine gun comes down to weight and feed system; rifles, with their\nrelatively light components (which overheat quickly) and small magazines, are\nincapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are. Modern\nmilitary rifles are fed by box magazines, while machine guns are generally (but\nnot always) belt-fed. While machine guns are often crewed by more than one\nsoldier, the rifle is an individual weapon.\n\nThe term \"rifle\" is sometimes used to describe rifled weapons firing explosive\nshells; for example the recoilless rifle.\n","linknr":483,"url":"Rifle","recorded":1362574443,"links":84,"instances":["solid_mechanics","firearms","firearm","bullet","bore_diameter","firearm","weaponry","rifle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hunting
