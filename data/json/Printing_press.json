The device applies pressure to a print\nmedium that rests on an inked surface made of moveable type, thereby\ntransferring the ink. Typically used for texts, the invention and spread of the\nprinting press are widely regarded as among the most influential events in the\nsecond millennium See [http://rhsweb.org/library/1000PeopleMillennium.htm\nPeople of the Millennium] for an overview of the wide acclaim.

The exact date of Gutenberg's press is debated based on\nexisting screw presses. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a\nprinting system by both adapting existing technologies and making inventions of\nhis own. His newly devised hand mould made possible the rapid creation of metal\nmovable type in large quantities. The printing press displaced earlier methods\nof printing and led to the first assembly line-style mass production of\nbooks. :  A single Renaissance printing press could produce 3,600\npages per workday, compared to about 2,000 by\ntypographic block-printing  and a few by hand-\ncopying. Books of bestselling authors like\nLuther or Erasmus were sold by the hundreds of thousands in their\nlifetime. ; \n\nPrinting soon spread from Mainz, Germany to over two hundred cities in a dozen\nEuropean countries. By 1500, printing presses in operation\nthroughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million\nvolumes. In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their\noutput rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies. The\noperation of a press became so synonymous with the enterprise of printing that\nit lent its name to a new branch of media, the press. :  The\nimportance of printing as an emblem of modern achievement and of the ability of\nso-called Moderns to rival the Ancients, in whose teachings much of Renaissance\nlearning was grounded, was enhanced by the frequent juxtaposition of the recent\ninvention of printing to those of firearms and the nautical\ncompass. Boruchoff 2012, pp. 133â163. In 1620, the English philosopher\nFrancis Bacon indeed wrote that these three inventions \"changed the whole face\nand state of the world\". Francis Bacon: \"\" â Adapted from the : \n\nIn Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing\nintroduced the era of mass communication which permanently altered the structure\nof society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and\n(revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the\nReformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the\nsharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education\nand learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the\nincreasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-\nnationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages\nto the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca.
