It is located at the western end of Gulf of Tadjoura in the Tadjoura\nRegion, touching Dikhil Region, at the top of the Great Rift Valley, some west\nof Djibouti city. Lake Assal is a saline lake which lies below sea level in the\nAfar Triangle, making it the lowest point on land in Africa and the third lowest\nland depression on Earth after the Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee. There is no\noutflow from the lake and, due to high evaporation, the salinity level of its\nwaters is ten times that of the sea, making it the most saline in the world\nafter Don Juan Pond. Lake Assal is the\nworld's largest salt reserve, which is presently exploited under four\nconcessions awarded in 2002 at the southeast end of the lake; the major share of\nproduction (nearly 80%) is held by SociÃ©tÃ© dâExploitation du Lac and SociÃ©tÃ©\ndâExploitation du Salt Investment S.A de Djibouti.\n\nThe lake, considered a \"national treasure\", is a protected zone under the law\nNo. 45/AN/04/5L of the National Environmental Action Plan, 2000. However, the\nlaw does not define the boundary limits of the lake. Since the exploitation of\nthe salt from the lake was uncontrolled, the Plan has emphasized the need for\nmanaging the exploitation to avoid negative impact on the lake environment. The\nGovernment of Djibouti has initiated a proposal with UNESCO to declare the Lake\nAssal zone and the Ardoukoba volcano as a World Heritage Site.\n","linknr":405,"url":"Lake_Assal_(Djibouti)","recorded":1362559092,"links":56,"instances":["city"],"pdf":["https://www2.opic.gov/environasp/eia/lakeassal/Lake_Assal_Salt_Project_EIA_Report_Nov08.pdf","https://www2.opic.gov/environasp/eia/lakeassal/Lake_Assal_Salt_Project_EIA_Report_Nov08.pdf","http://www.environnement.dj/Etudes%20d%27impact/Djibouti_Environmental_Management_Plan%2008%2011%2021.pdf","http://www.environnement.dj/Etudes%20d%27impact/Djibouti_Environmental_Management_Plan%2008%2011%2021.pdf","http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/27/5/819.pdf","http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/27/5/819.pdf","http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/27/5/819.pdf"],"categories":["Lakes of Djibouti|Assal","Extreme points of Earth","Crater lakes|Asal","Saline lakes","Lowest points"],"headings":["Geography","Climate","Geology","Hydrology","Demographics","Wildlife","Chemical composition","Salt extraction","See also","References","Source"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Lake_Assal_NASA.jpg/240px-Lake_Assal_NASA.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Lake_Assal_3-Djibouti.jpg/220px-Lake_Assal_3-Djibouti.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/DjiboutiLacAssal2.jpg/220px-DjiboutiLacAssal2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9d/Lake_Assal.png/350px-Lake_Assal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/DjiboutiBayofGoudouk.jpg/220px-DjiboutiBayofGoudouk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Lake_Assal_1-Djibouti.jpg/220px-Lake_Assal_1-Djibouti.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DjiboutiLacAssal.jpg/220px-DjiboutiLacAssal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["djibouti","city"]],"members":["djibouti"],"related":["Afar_Depression","Crater_lake","Ocean","Crater_lake","Djibouti","Gulf_of_Tadjoura","Tadjoura_Region","Dikhil_Region","Great_Rift_Valley,_Ethiopia","Djibouti_(city)","Sea_level","Afar_Triangle","Africa","Dead_Sea","Sea_of_Galilee","Don_Juan_Pond","UNESCO","Ardoukoba","World_Heritage_Site","Tonne","Afar_people","Somalis","Djibutians","Sorghum","Coal","Ethiopian_Empire","Coffee","Ivory","Musk","Slaves","Gulf_of_Tadjoura","France","Danakil_lakes","Tufa","Marls","Calcrete","Lagoon","Diatomite","Navicula","Kankar","Gypsum","Dreyfuss","Volcanic","Basalt","Gulf_of_Tadjoura","Gulf_of_Aden","Red_Sea","Afar_people","Bacteria","Antelopes","Camels","Lizards","Caribbean","South_America","Tonne","Salinity","Don_Juan_Pond","Dead_Sea","Eritrea","Gold","Lake_Afrera"]}
