Federal Election Commission]]\n}}\n\nThe 'Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002' ('BCRA', 'McCainâFeingold Act', , )\nis a United States federal law that amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of\n1971, which regulates the financing of political campaigns. Its chief sponsors\nwere Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain (R-AZ). The law became\neffective on 6 November 2002, and the new legal limits became effective on\nJanuary 1, 2003.\n\nAs noted in [[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]], a United States\nSupreme Court ruling on the BCRA, the Act was designed to address two issues:\n*The increased role of soft money in campaign financing, by prohibiting national\npolitical party committees from raising or spending any funds not subject to\nfederal limits, even for state and local races or issue discussion; *The\nproliferation of issue advocacy ads, by defining as \"electioneering\ncommunications\" broadcast ads that name a federal candidate within 30 days of a\nprimary or caucus or 60 days of a general election, and prohibiting any such ad\npaid for by a corporation (including non-profit issue organizations such as\nRight to Life or the Environmental Defense Fund) or paid for by an\nunincorporated entity using any corporate or union general treasury funds. The\ndecision in [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]] overturns this\nprovision, but not the ban on foreign corporations or foreign nationals in\ndecisions regarding political\nspending. [http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/electioneering.shtml\nElectioneering Communications], Federal Election Commission. January 2010.\n\nAlthough the legislation is known as \"McCainâFeingold\", the Senate version is\nnot the bill that became law. Instead, the companion legislation, H.R.\n2356âintroduced by Rep. Chris Shays (R-CT), is the version that became law.\nShaysâMeehan was originally introduced as H.R. 380.\n","linknr":189,"url":"Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act","recorded":1375070752,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/140px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","/wiki/107th_United_States_Congress","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ155/content-detail.html","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.107hr380","/wiki/Christopher_H._Shays","/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)","/wiki/Connecticut","http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.107hr2356","/wiki/George_W._Bush","/wiki/McConnell_v._Federal_Election_Commission","/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission_v._Wisconsin_Right_to_Life,_Inc.","/wiki/Davis_v._Federal_Election_Commission","/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission","/wiki/Template:Infobox_U.S._legislation","/wiki/Template_talk:Infobox_U.S._legislation","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_U.S._legislation&action=edit","http://www.law.cornell.edu/jureeka/index.php?doc=USPubLaws&cong=107&no=155","/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/STATUTE-116/STATUTE-116-Pg81/content-detail.html","http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.107hr2356","/wiki/United_States_federal_law","/wiki/Federal_Election_Campaign_Act","/wiki/Campaign_finance","/wiki/Russ_Feingold","/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party","/wiki/Wisconsin","/wiki/John_McCain","/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party","/wiki/Arizona","#cite_note-1","/wiki/McConnell_v._Federal_Election_Commission","/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court","/wiki/Soft_money","/wiki/Issue_advocacy_ads","/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Chris_Shays","#cite_note-3","#Legal_disputes","#Impact","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform","/wiki/Whip_(politics)","/wiki/Mitch_McConnell","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","/wiki/McConnell_v._FEC","/wiki/527_organization","/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code","/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code","http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/527.html","/wiki/Federal_Election_Campaign_Act","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Media_Fund","/wiki/Swift_Boat_Veterans_for_Truth","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Chris_Shays","/wiki/Marty_Meehan","/wiki/League_of_Conservation_Voters","/wiki/MoveOn.org","/wiki/Progress_for_America_Voter_Fund","/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission_v._Wisconsin_Right_to_Life,_Inc.","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Davis_v._Federal_Election_Commission","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Worth_the_Fighting_For","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission","/wiki/Hillary_Clinton","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-nyt1-12","/wiki/2010_State_of_the_Union_Address","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-nyt1-12","/w/index.php?title=Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/I_approve_this_message","/w/index.php?title=Bipartisan_Campaign_Reform_Act&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.fec.gov/press/bkgnd/bcra_overview.shtml","#cite_ref-2","http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/electioneering.shtml","#cite_ref-3","http://www.ncccusa.org/news/01news25.html","#cite_ref-4","http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020327.html","#cite_ref-5","http://www.fec.gov/ans/answers_general.shtml#527","#cite_ref-6","http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/16/politics/campaigns/16DONA.html","#cite_ref-7","http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aHBnZd4mkj8I&refer=home","#cite_ref-8","http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/davvfed","#cite_ref-9","http://www.ontheissues.org/john_mccain.htm","#cite_ref-10","http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/mccain/articles/2007/03/01/20070301mccainbio-chapter9.html","#cite_ref-11","http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/washington/25scotus.html?hp","#cite_ref-nyt1_12-0","#cite_ref-nyt1_12-1","http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/2
