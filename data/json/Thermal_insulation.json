Thermal insulation can be achieved\nwith specially engineered methods or processes, as well as with suitable object\nshapes and materials.\n\nHeat flow is an inevitable consequence of contact between objects of differing\ntemperature. Thermal insulation provides a region of insulation in which thermal\nconduction is reduced or thermal radiation is reflected rather than absorbed by\nthe lower-temperature body.\n\nThe insulating capability of a material is measured with thermal conductivity\n(k). Low thermal conductivity is equivalent to high insulating capability (R-\nvalue). In thermal engineering, other important properties of insulating\nmaterials are product density (Ï) and specific heat capacity (c).\n","linknr":198,"url":"Thermal_insulation","recorded":1362902860,"links":40,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.energycodes.gov/implement/pdfs/lib_ks_residential_insulation.pdf","http://www.energycodes.gov/implement/pdfs/lib_ks_energy-efficient_windows.pdf","http://www.energystar.gov/ia/home_improvement/home_sealing/DIY_COLOR_100_dpi.pdf"],"categories":["Heat transfer","Thermal protection"],"headings":["Applications","Factors influencing performance","Calculating requirements","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Steinwolle_1600dpi_roxul_rxl80.jpg/220px-Steinwolle_1600dpi_roxul_rxl80.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Hallway_insulation.jpg/220px-Hallway_insulation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Coloured_ceramic_thermal_barrier_coating_on_exhaust_component.jpg/220px-Coloured_ceramic_thermal_barrier_coating_on_exhaust_component.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Huygens_thermal_multilayer_insulation.jpg/220px-Huygens_thermal_multilayer_insulation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Aircraft_cabin_insulation_in_a_B747-8.jpg/220px-Aircraft_cabin_insulation_in_a_B747-8.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Heat_transfer","Thermal_energy","Temperature","Thermal_conduction","Thermal_radiation","Thermal_conductivity","R-value","Density","Heat_capacity","Evaporation","Endotherm","Thermal_bridge","Building","Ontario","Canada","Building","Acoustic_insulation","Window_insulation_film","Weatherization","Pipe_insulation","Condensation","Pipe_insulation","Space_Shuttle_Columbia","Carbon","Silicon_dioxide","Space_Shuttle","Insulative_paint","Internal_combustion_engine","Thermal_conductivity","Emissivity","Density","Specific_heat_capacity","Thermal_bridging","John_Wiley_&_Sons","Thermal_mass","List_of_thermal_conductivities","Insulative_paint"]}
