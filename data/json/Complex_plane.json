{"cursor":"27408","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, the 'complex plane' or 'z-plane' is a geometric representation\nof the complex numbers established by the 'real axis' and the orthogonal\n'imaginary axis'. It can be thought of as a modified Cartesian plane, with the\nreal part of a complex number represented by a displacement along the x-axis,\nand the imaginary part by a displacement along the y-axis. Although this is\nthe most common mathematical meaning of the phrase \"complex plane\", it is not\nthe only one possible. Alternatives include the split-complex plane and the dual\nnumbers, as introduced by quotient rings.\n\nThe concept of the complex plane allows a geometric interpretation of complex\nnumbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two\ncomplex numbers can be expressed most easily in polar coordinates – the\nmagnitude or modulus of the product is the product of the two absolute values,\nor moduli, and the angle or argument of the product is the sum of the two\nangles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of\nmodulus 1 acts as a rotation.\n\nThe complex plane is sometimes called the 'Argand plane' because it is used in\n'Argand diagrams'. These are named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768â1822),\nalthough they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and\nmathematician Caspar Wessel (1745â1818). Wessel's memoir was presented to\nthe Danish Academy in 1797; Argand's paper was published in 1806. (Whittaker &\nWatson, 1927, p. 9) Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the\npositions of the poles and zeroes of a function in the complex plane.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Complex_plane","recorded":1362374633,"links":40,"instances":["mathematics","complex_analysis","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","complex_analysis","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Complex analysis","Complex numbers","Control theory"],"headings":["Notational conventions","Stereographic projections","Cutting the plane","Gluing the cut plane back together","Use of the complex plane in control theory","Other meanings of \"complex plane\"","Terminology","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Complex_conjugate_picture.svg/220px-Complex_conjugate_picture.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/9/b/d9b564a7f712e9e4f3ae75cf097dfce5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/6/fc699a1857fa8562f195df6d225f1b56.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/9/7f9cae52bc28e71f3c20e3fcdedb92e5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/5/c/65cb83d0fc7ba50acc6bbf46de99a00b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/f/69f1a26539cce3c3e66f17e00f24b941.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/2/c42cf0797365731725c78be82b42c762.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/4/17462a705dfc12ca18631eaaf69bca33.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/3/b/f3bbb331ad598855b89cd32dd166fe12.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/e/d/fed76894ca94d045b5ff4824d090a690.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/8/8484d58e56e3bc585a9c5e4b9fec9188.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/3/6/d36a20e219912e097bb04f7eacf881e1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/4/d/a4d6380b1493df283489e4f590cbfbd2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/d/d5dfd6a19f424f772f28d90de052ac1c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/7/5b70bc1c905fa89d8c7256320971f82b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/7/b/a7b4f5a3d08013dadf3267bce9d6531b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/f/4bf58a67eee1dda64bf5ac857e279ae9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/5/a/c5aa73e459ca57a8d81e59074f1c199b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vector","geometry"],["pole","complex_analysis"],["zero","complex_analysis"],["domain","mathematics"],["range","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["pole","complex_analysis"],["series","mathematics"],["genus","mathematics#orientable_surface"]],"members":["function","pole","genus","range","series","domain","zero","vector"],"related":["Mathematics","Complex_numbers","Cartesian_plane","Real_part","Imaginary_part","Split-complex_number","Dual_number","Addition","Vector_(geometry)","Multiplication","Polar_coordinates","Absolute_value","Jean-Robert_Argand","Caspar_Wessel","Pole_(complex_analysis)","Zero_(complex_analysis)","Mathematical_function","Complex_analysis","Imaginary_unit","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Polar_coordinates","Inverse_trigonometric_function","Radian","Euler's_formula","Inner_product","Unit_circle","Domain_(mathematics)","Range_(mathematics)","Sphere","Bijection","Riemann_sphere","Function_(mathematics)","Branch_point","Meromorphic_function","Holomorphic_function","Analytic_function","Countable_set","Proof_that_holomorphic_functions_are_analytic","Pole_(complex_analysis)","Gamma_function","Euler-Mascheroni_constant","Infinite_product","Uniform_convergence","Line_integral","Residue_theorem","Series_(mathematics)","Generalized_continued_fraction","Even_and_odd_functions","Riemann_zeta_function","Convergence_problem","Topology","Orientable","Control_theory","Laplace_transform","Nyquist_stability_criterion","Nyquist_plot","Transfer_function","Z-transform","Minkowski_space","Split-complex_number","Dual_number","Cartesian_product","Complex_vector_space","Constellation_diagram","Riemann_sphere","S_plane"]}
