{"cursor":"9998","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer science, 'data validation' is the process of ensuring that a program\noperates on clean, correct and useful data. It uses routines, often called\n\"validation rules\" or \"check routines\", that check for correctness,\nmeaningfulness, and security of data that are input to the system. The rules may\nbe implemented through the automated facilities of a data dictionary, or by the\ninclusion of explicit application program validation logic.\n\nFor business applications, data validation can be defined through declarative\ndata integrity rules, or procedure-based business rules. [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-\nus/library/aa291820(VS.71).aspx Data Validation, Data Integrity, Designing\nDistributed Applications with Visual Studio .NET] Data that does not\nconform to these rules will negatively affect business process execution.\nTherefore, data validation should start with business process definition and set\nof business rules within this process. Rules can be collected through the\nrequirements capture exercise. Arkady Maydanchik (2007), \"Data Quality\nAssessment\", Technics Publications, LLC\n\nThe simplest data validation verifies that the characters provided come from a\nvalid set. For example, telephone numbers should include the digits and possibly\nthe characters + , - , ( , and\n) (plus, minus, and brackets). A more sophisticated data validation\nroutine would check to see the user had entered a valid country code, i.e., that\nthe number of digits entered matched the convention for the country or area\nspecified.\n\nIncorrect data validation can lead to data corruption or a security\nvulnerability. Data validation checks that data are valid, sensible, reasonable,\nand secure before they are processed.\n\nA validation process involves two distinct steps: (a) Validation Check and (b)\nPost-Check action. The check step uses one or more computational rules (see\nsection below) to determine if the data is valid. The Post-validation action\nsends feedback to help enforce validation.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Data_validation","recorded":1362579617,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer security","Data quality"],"headings":["Validation methods","Post-validation actions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Computer_science","Validation_rule","Data_dictionary","Application_program","Declarative_programming","Data_integrity","Imperative_programming","Business_rules","Numerical_digit","Data_corruption","Software_security_vulnerability","HTML","E-mail","Regular_expression","Cardinality","ISBN","Modular_arithmetic","Referential_integrity","Relational_database","Foreign_key","Primary_key","Data_truncation"]}
