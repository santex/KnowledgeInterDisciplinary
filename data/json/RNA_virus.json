This nucleic acid is usually\nsingle-stranded RNA (ssRNA), but may be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Notable human diseases caused by RNA viruses include SARS,\ninfluenza, hepatitis C, West Nile fever, polio and measles.\n\nThe ICTV classifies RNA viruses as those that belong to Group III, Group IV or\nGroup V of the Baltimore classification system of classifying viruses, and does\nnot consider viruses with DNA intermediates in their life cycle as RNA\nviruses. Viruses with RNA as their genetic material but which include DNA\nintermediates in their replication cycle are called retroviruses, and comprise\nGroup VI of the Baltimore classification. Notable human retroviruses include HIV-\n1 and HIV-2, the cause of the disease AIDS.\n\nAnother term for RNA viruses that explicitly excludes retroviruses is\n'ribovirus'.\n","linknr":584,"url":"RNA_virus","recorded":1362374374,"links":107,"instances":["biology","genetics","molecular_biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA viruses|","RNA"],"headings":["Characteristics","Replication","Classification","Group III - dsRNA viruses","Group IV - positive-sense ssRNA viruses","Group V - negative-sense ssRNA viruses","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sense","molecular_biology"],["sense","molecular_biology"],["translation","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["satellite","biology"],["sense","molecular_biology"]],"members":["satellite","translation","sense","transcription"],"related":["Virus","RNA","Genetic_material","Nucleic_acid","SARS","Influenza","Hepatitis_C","West_Nile_fever","Polio","Measles","International_Committee_on_Taxonomy_of_Viruses","DNA","Retrovirus","HIV-1","HIV-2","AIDS","Sense_(molecular_biology)","Sense_(molecular_biology)","MRNA","Translation_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase","Transcription_(genetics)","Virion","Ambisense","Double-stranded_RNA_viruses","Fungi","Bacteria","Genome","Virion","Capsid","Rotavirus","Gastroenteritis","Picobirnavirus","Picobirnavirus","Bluetongue_virus","Mutation","DNA_virus","DNA_polymerase","Vaccines","Retrovirus","Hepatitis_C_virus","Conserved_sequence","Internal_ribosome_entry_site","Double-stranded_RNA_viruses","Ribosomes","RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase","RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase","Ribosomes","Capsid","Retrovirus","Reverse_transcriptase","Integrase","Viroid","Satellite_(biology)","Clades","Helicase","Eukaryote","Retroelement","Protease","Bacteriophage","Birnaviridae","Chrysoviridae","Cystoviridae","Endornaviridae","Hypoviridae","Megabirnaviridae","Partitiviridae","Picobirnaviridae","Reoviridae","Rotavirus","Totiviridae","Mesoniviridae","Alphamesonivirus","ICTV","Nidovirales","Arterivirus","Coronaviridae","Coronavirus","Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome","Okavirus","Picornavirales","Dicistroviridae","Iflaviridae","Marnaviridae","Picornaviridae","Poliovirus","Rhinovirus","Hepatitis_A","Secoviridae","Comoviridae","Bacillariornavirus","Labyrnavirus","Tymovirales","Alphaflexiviridae","Betaflexiviridae","Gammaflexiviridae","Tymoviridae","Alphatetraviridae","Alvernaviridae","Astroviridae","Barnavirus","Bromoviridae","Caliciviridae","Norwalk_virus","Carmotetraviridae","Closteroviridae","Flaviviridae","Yellow_fever","West_Nile_virus","Hepatitis_C_virus","Dengue_fever","Leviviridae","Luteoviridae","Barley_yellow_dwarf_virus","Narnaviridae","Nodaviridae","Permutotetraviridae","Potyviridae","Togaviridae","Rubella","Ross_River_virus","Sindbis_virus","Chikungunya_virus","Tombusviridae","Virgaviridae","Hepatitis_E","Negevirus","Botrytis_virus_F","Canine_picodicistrovirus","Chronic_bee_paralysis_associated_satellite_virus","Extra_small_virus","Heterocapsa_circularisquama_RNA_virus","Kelp_fly_virus","Le_Blanc_virus","Orsay_virus","Santeuil_virus","Solenopsis_invicta_virus_2","Solenopsis_invicta_virus_3","Borna_disease","Borna_disease_virus","Filoviridae","Ebola","Marburg_virus","Paramyxoviridae","Measles","Mumps_virus","Nipah_virus","Hendra_virus","Rhabdoviridae","Rabies","Arenaviridae","Lassa_virus","Bunyaviridae","Hantavirus","Crimean-Congo_hemorrhagic_fever","Ophioviridae","Orthomyxoviridae","Influenza","Orchid_fleck_virus","Taastrup_virus","Virus_classification","Sense_(molecular_biology)","Animal_virology","Double-stranded_RNA_viruses","Retrovirus","DNA_viruses"]}
