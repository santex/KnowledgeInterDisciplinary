It is used to soak up liquid, for cleaning floors and other\nsurfaces, or to mop up dust, or for other cleaning purposes. The word (then\nspelled mappe) is attested in English as early as 1496, but new refinements and\nvariations of mop designs have been introduced, from time to time. For example,\nAmerican inventor Jacob Howe received U.S. patent #241 for a mop holder in 1837\n<ref></ref> and African American inventor Thomas W.
