      "text" : "\n\n\n late in World War II. Unlike the cylindrical, barrel-shaped depth charge used\n earlier, the Mark IX is streamlined and equipped with canted fins to impart\n rotation on the depth charge, allowing it to fall in a straight trajectory with\n less chance of drifting off target. This type of depth charge contained 200\n pounds (90 kg) of Torpex.]]\n\nA 'depth charge' is an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) weapon intended to destroy\nor cripple a target submarine by the shock of exploding near it. Most use\nconventional explosives and a fuze set to go off at a preselected depth in the\nocean. Depth charges can be dropped by surface ships, patrol aircraft, or\nhelicopters. The depth charge has now largely been replaced by anti-submarine\nhoming torpedoes.\n\nA depth charge fitted with a nuclear warhead is known as a nuclear depth bomb.\nThese were designed to be dropped from a patrol plane or deployed by anti-\nsubmarine missile from a surface ship, or another submarine, located a safe\ndistance away. All nuclear anti-submarine weapons were withdrawn from service by\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China in or around\n1990. They were replaced by conventional weapons that provided ever-increasing\naccuracy and range as ASW technology improved.\n",
