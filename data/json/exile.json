It can be a form of punishment and\nsolitude.<ref Name=\"Hobbes\"></ref>\n\nIt is common to distinguish between 'internal exile', i.e., forced resettlement\nwithin the country of residence, and 'external exile', deportation outside the\ncountry of residence.<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/inte-\nrnal%2Bexile. Retrieved 2013-02-09 </ref> Although most commonly used to\ndescribe an individual situation, the term is also used for groups (especially\nethnic or national groups), or for an entire government. Terms such as\n'[[diaspora]]' and '[[refugee]]' describe group exile, both voluntary and\nforced, and '[[government in exile]]' describes a government of a country that\nhas been forced to relocate and argue its legitimacy from outside that country.\n\nExile can also be a self-imposed departure from one's homeland. Self-exile is\noften depicted as a form of protest by the person that claims it, to avoid\npersecution or legal matters (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of\nshame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a\nparticular thing.\n\nArticle 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that, \"No one\nshall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"\n",
