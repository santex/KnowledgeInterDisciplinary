Collaboration is also present in opposing\ngoals exhibiting the notion of adversarial collaboration, though this is not a\ncommon case for using the word.\n\nStructured methods of collaboration encourage introspection of behavior and\ncommunication. These methods specifically aim to\nincrease the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem solving.\nForms, rubrics, charts and graphs are useful in these situations to objectively\ndocument personal traits with the goal of improving performance in current and\nfuture projects.\n\nSince the Second World War the term \"Collaboration\" acquired a very negative\nmeaning as referring to persons and groups which help a foreign occupier of\ntheir countryâdue to actual use by people in European countries who worked with\nand for the Nazi German occupiers. Linguistically, \"collaboration\" implies more\nor less equal partners who work togetherâwhich is obviously not the case when\none party is an army of occupation and the other are people of the occupied\ncountry living under the power of this army.\n\nIn order to make a distinction, the more specific term Collaborationism is often\nused for this phenomenon of collaboration with an occupying army. However, there\nis no water-tight distinction; \"Collaboration\" and \"Collaborator\", as well as\n\"Collaborationism\" and \"Collaborationist\", are often used in this pejorative\nsenseâand even more so, the equivalent terms in French and other languages\nspoken in countries which experienced direct Nazi occupation.\n","linknr":546,"url":"Collaborative","recorded":1362669682,"links":43,"instances":["game_designer","music","business","property","business_writer","journalism","intentional_community"],"pdf":["http://revolutionphiladelphia.aiga.org/resources/content/2/5/7/0/documents/MSpence.pdf","http://revolutionphiladelphia.aiga.org/resources/content/2/5/7/0/documents/MSpence.pdf"],"categories":["Collaboration","International
