In 1801, with the union of Great Britain and Ireland,\nthat house was in turn replaced by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Parliament of England developed from the Magnum Concilium that advised the\nEnglish monarch in medieval times. This royal council, meeting for short\nperiods, included ecclesiastics, noblemen, as well as representatives of the\ncounties (known as \"knights of the shire\"). The chief duty of the council was to\napprove taxes proposed by the Crown. In many cases, however, the council\ndemanded the redress of the people's grievances before proceeding to vote on\ntaxation. Thus, it developed legislative powers. Barker, E. (1951). Essays\non Government. 2nd ed. London: Oxford Press, pg. 62-3.\n\nIn the \"Model Parliament\" of 1295, representatives of the boroughs (including\ntowns and cities) were also admitted. Thus, it became settled practice that each\ncounty send two knights of the shire, and that each borough send two burgesses.\nAt first, the burgesses were almost entirely powerless; while the right to\nrepresentation of each English county quickly became indisputable, the monarch\ncould enfranchise or disfranchise boroughs at pleasure. Any show of independence\nby burgesses would thus be likely to lead to the exclusion of their towns from\nParliament. The knights of the shire were in a better position, although less\npowerful than their noble and clerical counterparts in what was still a\nunicameral Parliament.\n\nThe division of the Parliament of England into two houses occurred during the\nreign of Edward III: in 1341 the Commons met separately from the nobility and\nclergy for the first time, creating in effect an Upper Chamber and a Lower\nChamber, with the knights and burgesses sitting in the latter. They formed what\nbecame known as the House of Commons, while the clergy and nobility became the\nHouse of Lords. Although they remained subordinate to both the Crown and the\nLords, the Commons did act with increasing boldness. During the Good Parliament\nof 1376, the Commons appointed Sir Peter de la Mare to convey to the Lords their\ncomplaints of heavy taxes, demands for an accounting of the royal expenditures,\nand criticism of the King's management of the military. The Commons even proceeded to impeach some of the King's\nministers. Although de la Mare was imprisoned for his actions, the benefits of\nhaving a single voice to represent the Commons were recognised, and an office of\nSpeaker of the House of Commons was created. Mare was soon released after the death of Edward III\nand became the second Speaker of the House in 1377.\n\nDuring the reign of the next monarch, Richard II, the Commons once again began\nto impeach errant ministers of the Crown. They insisted that they could not\nonly control taxation, but also public expenditures. Despite such gains in\nauthority, however, the Commons still remained much less powerful than the\nLords or the Crown. , c. 1710]] The influence of the Crown was increased by the\ncivil wars of the late fifteenth century, which destroyed the power of the\ngreat nobles. Both houses of Parliament held little power during the ensuing\nyears, and the absolute supremacy of the Sovereign was restored. The domination\nof the monarch grew further under the Tudor dynasty in the sixteenth century.\nThis trend, however, was somewhat reversed when the House of Stuart came to the\nEnglish Throne in 1603. The first two Stuart monarchs, James I and Charles I,\nprovoked conflicts with the Commons over issues such as taxation, religion, and\nroyal powers.\n\nThe differences between Charles I and Parliament were great, and resulted in the\nEnglish Civil War, in which the armed forces of Parliament were victorious. In\nDecember 1648 the House of Commons was purged by the New Model Army, which was\nsupposed to be subservient to Parliament. Pride's Purge was indeed the only\nmilitary coup in English history. Subsequently, King Charles I was beheaded and\nthe Upper House was abolished. The unicameral Parliament that remained was later\nreferred to by critics as the Rump Parliament, as it consisted only of a small\nselection of Members of Parliament approved by the army - some of whom were\nsoldiers themselves. In 1653, when leading figures in this Parliament began to\ndisagree with the army, it was dissolved by Oliver Cromwell. However, the\nmonarchy and the House of Lords were both restored with the Commons in 1660. The\ninfluence of the Crown had been decreased, and was further diminished when James\nII was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.\n","linknr":267,"url":"House_of_Commons_of_England","recorded":1375085671,"links":["/w/index.php?title=House_of_Commons_of_England&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=House_of_Commons_of_England&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_England_(1509-1554).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281509-1554%29.svg/255px-Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281509-1554%29.svg.png","/wiki/Lower_house","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Voting_system","/wiki/First_past_the_post","/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Parliament_of_England","/wiki/Wales","/wiki/England","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Magnum_Concilium","/wiki/County","/wiki/Knights_of_the_shire","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Model_Parliament","/wiki/Borough","/wiki/Peerage","/wiki/Clergy","/wiki/Unicameral","/wiki/Edward_III_of_England","/wiki/Good_Parliament","/wiki/Peter_de_la_Mare","#cite_note-Given-Wilson_2004-2","/wiki/Impeachment","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","#cite_note-Given-Wilson_2004-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Richard_II_of_England","/wiki/File:Commons_In_Session.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Commons_In_Session.jpg/165px-Commons_In_Session.jpg","/wiki/File:Commons_In_Session.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Peter_Tillemans","/wiki/Tudor_dynasty","/wiki/House_of_Stuart","/wiki/James_I_of_England","/wiki/Charles_I_of_England","/wiki/English_Civil_War","/wiki/New_Model_Army","/wiki/Pride%27s_Purge","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell","/wiki/James_II_of_England","/wiki/Glorious_Revolution","/w/index.php?title=House_of_Commons_of_England&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Duration_of_English_Parliaments_before_1660","/wiki/History_of_borough_status_in_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Lex_Parliamentaria","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Parliament_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Parliaments_of_England","/wiki/List_of_Speakers_of_the_House_of_Commons_of_England","/wiki/Modus_Tenendi_Parliamentum","/w/index.php?title=House_of_Commons_of_England&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-Given-Wilson_2004_2-0","#cite_ref-Given-Wilson_2004_2-1","/wiki/Continuum_International_Publishing_Group","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-85285-358-7","/wiki/OCLC","//www.worldcat.org/oclc/59259407","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/Manchester_University_Press","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-7190-0833-7","/wiki/OCLC","//www.worldcat.org/oclc/7681359","/wiki/Template:Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Template_talk:Kingdom_of_England","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Kingdom_of_England&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/23px-Flag_of_England.svg.png","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/History_of_England","/wiki/Timeline_of_English_history","/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_England","/wiki/Heptarchy","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England","/wiki/Anglo-Norman","/wiki/Angevin_Empire","/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses","/wiki/Tudor_period","/wiki/Stuart_period_(England)","/wiki/English_Renaissance","/wiki/English_Reformation","/wiki/Elizabethan_era","/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns","/wiki/English_overseas_possessions","/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot","/wiki/Jacobean_era","/wiki/English_Civil_War","/wiki/Interregnum_(England)","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_England","/wiki/The_Protectorate","/wiki/Restoration_(England)","/wiki/Popish_Plot","/wiki/Glorious_Revolution","/wiki/Maritime_history_of_England","/wiki/Economy_of_England_in_the_Middle_Ages","/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707","/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_England_(1558-1603).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg/120px-Coat_of_Arms_of_England_%281558-1603%29.svg.png","/wiki/Royal_house","/wiki/House_of_Wessex","/wiki/House_of_Kn%C3%BDtlinga","/wiki/House_of_Normandy","/wiki/House_of_Plant
