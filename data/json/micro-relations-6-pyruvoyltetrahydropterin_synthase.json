The systematic name of this enzyme class is '6-[(1S,2R)-1,2-dihydroxy-3-triphosphooxypropyl]-7,8-\ndihydropterin triphosphate-lyase (6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin-forming)'.\nOther names in common use include '2-amino-4-oxo-6-[(1S,2R)-1,2-dihydroxy-3-triphosphooxypropyl]-7,8-\n', and 'dihydroxypteridine triphosphate lyase'. This enzyme participates in\ntetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis.\n","linknr":203,"url":"6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin_synthase","recorded":1362510984,"links":15,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 4.2.3","Enzymes of known structure"],"headings":["Structural studies","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["product","chemistry"]],"members":["substrate","product"],"related":["Enzymology","Enzyme","Catalysis","Chemical_reaction","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Pterin","Product_(chemistry)","6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin","Triphosphate","Lyase","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Tertiary_structure","Protein_Data_Bank"]}
