{"cursor":"11613","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer graphics, accounting for 'level of detail' involves decreasing the\ncomplexity of a 3D object representation as it moves away from the viewer or\naccording other metrics such as object importance, eye-space speed or position.\nLevel of detail techniques increases the efficiency of rendering by decreasing\nthe workload on graphics pipeline stages, usually vertex transformations. The\nreduced visual quality of the model is often unnoticed because of the small\neffect on object appearance when distant or moving fast.\n\nAlthough most of the time LOD is applied to geometry detail only, the basic\nconcept can be generalized. Recently, LOD techniques included also shader\nmanagement to keep control of pixel complexity. A form of level of detail\nmanagement has been applied to textures for years, under the name of mipmapping,\nalso providing higher rendering quality.\n\nIt is commonplace to say that \"an object has been LOD'd\" when the object is\nsimplified by the underlying LOD-ing algorithm.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Level_of_detail","recorded":1362889687,"links":29,"instances":["computer_graphics","computer_graphics","computer_graphics","data_structure","computer_graphics","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/PDFs/clark-vis-surface.pdf","http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/ProjectSummaries/hlods.pdf","https://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~geom/papers/documents/dissertations/erikson00.pdf"],"categories":["3D computer graphics"],"headings":["Historical reference","Well known approaches","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/DiscreteLodAndCullExampleRanges.MaxDZ8.svg/200px-DiscreteLodAndCullExampleRanges.MaxDZ8.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/WireSphereMaxTass.MaxDZ8.jpg/120px-WireSphereMaxTass.MaxDZ8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/WireSphereHiTass.MaxDZ8.jpg/120px-WireSphereHiTass.MaxDZ8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/WireSphereStdTass.MaxDZ8.jpg/120px-WireSphereStdTass.MaxDZ8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/WireSphereLowTass.MaxDZ8.jpg/120px-WireSphereLowTass.MaxDZ8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/WireSphereMinTass.MaxDZ8.jpg/120px-WireSphereMinTass.MaxDZ8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/SpheresBruteForce.MaxDZ8.jpg/200px-SpheresBruteForce.MaxDZ8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/SpheresLodded.MaxDZ8.jpg/200px-SpheresLodded.MaxDZ8.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/DifferenceImageBruteLod.MaxDZ8.png/200px-DifferenceImageBruteLod.MaxDZ8.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clipping","computer_graphics"],["tree","data_structure"],["heuristic","computer_science"],["culling","computer_graphics"],["popping","computer_graphics"],["computer_graphics","computer_science#geometry"],["rendering","computer_graphics"]],"members":["popping","culling","clipping","tree","computer_graphics","rendering","heuristic"],"related":["Computer_graphics","Graphics_pipeline","Shader","Mipmapping","James_H._Clark","Clipping_(computer_graphics)","Tree_(data_structure)","Heuristic_(computer_science)","Edwin_Catmull","Culling_(computer_graphics)","Alpha_blending","Morphing","Popping_(computer_graphics)","Polygon_mesh","Polygon_reduction_technique","Out_of_core","Central_processing_unit","Geomipmapping","Terrain_rendering","Sphere","Procedural_generation","CPU_bound","Hard_code","OpenGL","Display_list","MeshLab","Polygon_Cruncher","Simplygon","Real-time_computer_graphics","Vizup","Software_development_kit","Rendering_(computer_graphics)","Rational_Reducer","Pro_Optimizer","James_H._Clark"]}
