{"cursor":"2586","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]]\n\nMany viruses (e.g. influenza and many animal viruses) have 'viral envelopes'\ncovering their protein capsids.\nThe envelopes typically are derived from portions of the host cell membranes\n(phospholipids and proteins), but include some viral glycoproteins.\nFunctionally, viral envelopes are used to help viruses enter host cells.\nGlycoproteins on the surface of the envelope serve to identify and bind to\nreceptor sites on the host's membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with\nthe host's membrane, allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter and\ninfect the host.\n\nUsually, the cell from which the virus itself buds will often die or be\nweakened, and shed more viral particles for an extended period. The lipid\nbilayer envelope of these viruses is relatively sensitive to desiccation, heat,\nand detergents, therefore these viruses are easier to sterilize than non-\nenveloped viruses, have limited survival outside host environments, and\ntypically must transfer directly from host to host. Enveloped viruses have a\ngreat adaptability and can change rapidly in a short time in order to evade the\nimmune system. Enveloped viruses can cause persistent infections.\n","linknr":276,"url":"Nonenveloped","recorded":1362554071,"links":41,"instances":["biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Virology|Envelope"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/CMVschema.svg/250px-CMVschema.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","host"],"related":["Virus","Capsid","Cell_membrane","Phospholipids","Glycoprotein","Host_(biology)","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Lipid_bilayer","Desiccation","Infection","Herpesviridae","Poxviruses","Hepadnaviruses","Flavivirus","Togavirus","Coronavirus","Hepatitis_D","Orthomyxovirus","Paramyxovirus","Rhabdovirus","Bunyavirus","Filovirus","Retroviruses","Hepadnavirus","Bacterial_capsule","Cell_envelope"]}
