In chicken egg white, avidin makes up approximately 0.05% of total\nprotein (approximately 1.8 mg per egg). The tetrameric protein contains\nfour identical subunits (homotetramer), each of which can bind to biotin\n(Vitamin B 7, vitamin H) with a high degree of affinity and\nspecificity. The dissociation constant of avidin is measured to be K D\nâ 10 â15 M, making it one of the strongest known non-covalent\nbonds.\n\nIn its tetrameric form, avidin is estimated to be between 66â69 kDa in\nsize. Ten percent of the molecular weight is attributed to\ncarbohydrate content composed of four to five mannose and three N-\nacetylglucosamine residues. The carbohydrate moieties of avidin\ncontain at least three unique oligosaccharide structural types that are similar\nin structure and composition.\n\nFunctional avidin is found only in raw egg, as the biotin avidity of the protein\nis destroyed by cooking. The natural function of avidin in eggs is not known,\nalthough it has been postulated to be made in the oviduct as a bacterial growth-\ninhibitor, by binding biotin the bacteria need. As evidence for this,\nstreptavidin, a loosely related protein with equal biotin affinity and a very\nsimilar binding site, is made by certain strains of [[Streptomyces]] bacteria,\nand is thought to serve to inhibit the growth of competing bacteria, in the\nmanner of an antibiotic.\n\nA non-glycosylated form of avidin has been isolated from commercially prepared\nproduct; however, it is not conclusive as to whether the non-glycosylated form\noccurs naturally or is a product of the manufacturing process.\n","linknr":578,"url":"Avidin","recorded":1362507567,"links":35,"instances":["microbiology","biochemistry","unit","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.biochemj.org/bj/089/0585/0890585.pdf","http://www.biochemj.org/bj/089/0585/0890585.pdf"],"categories":["Glycoproteins"],"headings":["Discovery of avidin","Applications of avidin","Modified forms of avidin","Inactivation of biotin binding activity","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/PDB_1sws_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1sws_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Biotin_structure.svg/220px-Biotin_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Chicken_egg01_monovular.jpg/220px-Chicken_egg01_monovular.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["dalton","unit"],["d-value","microbiology"],["denaturation","biochemistry"]],"members":["denaturation","dalton","egg"],"related":["Tetrameric_protein","Protein_dimer","Biotin","Protein","Oviduct","Bird","Reptile","Amphibian","Egg_(biology)","Protein_subunit","Biotin","Dissociation_constant","Dalton_(unit)","Mannose","N-acetylglucosamine","Carbohydrate","Oligosaccharide","Streptavidin","Antibiotic","Glycosylated","Esmond_Emerson_Snell","Biotin","Yeast","University_of_Texas","Wilchek","Antibodies","Western_blot","ELISA","ELISPOT","Pull-down_assay","Radioimmunoassay","Biotinylation","Neutravidin","Antinutrient","Assay","D-value_(microbiology)","Z-value","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Streptavidin","Biotinylation","Biotin"]}
