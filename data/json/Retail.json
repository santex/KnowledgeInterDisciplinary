{"cursor":"22356","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Retail' is the sale of goods and services from individuals or businesses to the\nend-user. Retailers are part of an integrated system called the supply chain. A\nretailer purchases goods or products in large quantities from manufacturers\ndirectly or through a wholesale, and then sells smaller quantities to the\nconsumer for a profit. Retailing can be done in either fixed locations like\nstores or markets, door-to-door or by delivery. Retailing includes subordinated\nservices, such as delivery. The term \"retailer\" is also applied where a service\nprovider services the needs of a large number of individuals, such as a public.\nShops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses or in a\nshopping mall. Shopping streets may be for pedestrians only. Sometimes a\nshopping street has a partial or full roof to protect customers from\nprecipitation. Online retailing, a type of electronic commerce used for business-to-\nconsumer (B2C) transactions and mail order, are forms of non-shop retailing.\n\nShopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is\ndone to obtain necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it is done\nas a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window\nshopping (just looking, not buying) and browsing and does not always result\nin a purchase.\n","linknr":533,"url":"Retail","recorded":1362579596,"links":64,"instances":["economics","retail","commerce","supervalu","meteorology","statistics","workplace","business","business"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Retailing|"],"headings":["Etymology","Types
