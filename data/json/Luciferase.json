The name is derived from\nLucifer, the root of which means 'light-bearer' (lucem ferre). One example is\nthe firefly luciferase () from the firefly [[Photinus pyralis]]. \"Firefly luciferase\" as a laboratory reagent often\nrefers to P. pyralis luciferase although recombinant luciferases from several\nother species of fireflies are also commercially available.\n","linknr":660,"url":"Luciferase","recorded":1362481339,"links":43,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.promega.com/pnotes/100/16620_22/16620_22.pdf","http://www.promega.com/pnotes/100/16620_22/16620_22.pdf"],"categories":["Protein domains","Oxidoreductases","Bioluminescence"],"headings":["Examples","Mechanism of reaction","Bifunctionality","Structure","Spectral differences in bioluminescence","Regulation","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Firefly_Luciferase_Crystal_Structure.rsh.png/200px-Firefly_Luciferase_Crystal_Structure.rsh.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/PDB_1vpr_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1vpr_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/PDB_1vpr_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1vpr_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Luciferase_Mechanism.gif/450px-Luciferase_Mechanism.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Luciferasepathways.gif/550px-Luciferasepathways.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Protein_Structure.jpg/300px-Protein_Structure.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["transcription","genetics"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["substrate","promoter","transcription"],"related":["Firefly","Enzyme","Bioluminescence","Photoprotein","Lucifer","Firefly","Recombinant_DNA","Firefly","Species","Elateroidea","Molecular_phylogeny","Abdominal","Invertebrate_trachea","Photinini","Sea_pansy","Renilla-luciferin_2-monooxygenase","Green_fluorescent_protein","Coelenterazine","Resonance_energy_transfer","Coelenterazine","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Dinoflagellate","Protein_domain","N-terminal","Catalytic_domain","Secondary_structure","Catalytic","Protein_domain","Beta_barrel","Structurally","Lipocalin","FABP","Conserved_sequence","Luciferin","Vacuolar","Helix_bundle","Secondary_structure","Histidines","PH","Enzyme","Firefly_luciferin","Adenosine_triphosphate","Luciferyl_adenylate","Pyrophosphate","Oxyluciferin","Adenosine_monophosphate","Excited_state","Ground_state","Hydrogen_peroxide","Flavin_mononucleotide","Aldehyde","Carboxylic_acid","Light_bulb","Energy","Adenylation","Decarboxylation","Keto-enol_tautomerism","Coenzyme_A","Luciferyl_CoA","Long-chain-fatty-acidâ€”CoA_ligase","Fatty_acid","Beta_oxidation","Protein_domain","N-terminus","C-terminus","Beta_sheet","Beta_barrel","Amino_acid_sequence","Conserved_sequence","Active_site","Conformational_change","Hydrolysis","Emission_spectrum","Photon","Ketone","Enol","5,5-dimethyloxyluciferin","Benzothiazole","Thiazole","Microenvironment","Amino_acid","Arginine","Electrostatics","Enzyme_inhibitor","Isomers","Competitive_inhibition","Esterase","Allosteric_regulation","Enzyme_activator","Genetic_engineering","Gene","Mouse","Silkworm","Potato","Luciferin","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Luminometer","Transcription_(genetics)","Promoter_(biology)","Caspase","Cytochrome_P450","Assay","Biotinylation","Streptavidin","Biotin","Genetic_modification","CCD_camera","Intracellular_pH","Blood_bank","Red_blood_cell","Forensic","Protein_denaturation","Heat_shock_proteins","Firefly","Luciferin","Firefly_luciferin","Bioluminescence_imaging","Quorum_sensing"]}
