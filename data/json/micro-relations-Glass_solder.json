Frank Oberg, Franklin D. Jones, Holbrook\nL.Horton, Henry H. Ryffel (ed) Machinery's Handbook 23rd Edition Industrial\nPress Inc., 1988, ISBN 0-8311-1200-X, page 1203 It is commonly used in\nelectronics, plumbing, and assembly of sheet metal parts. Manual soldering uses\na soldering iron or soldering gun. Alloys that melt between are the most\ncommonly used. Soldering performed using alloys with melting point above is\ncalled 'hard soldering', 'silver soldering', or brazing.\n\nFor certain proportions an alloy becomes eutectic and melts at a single\ntemperature; non-eutectic alloys have markedly different [[solidus\n(chemistry)|solidus]] and [[liquidus]] temperature, and within that range they\nexist as a paste of solid particles in a melt of the lower-melting phase. In\nelectrical work, if the joint is disturbed in the pasty state before it has\nsolidified totally, a poor electrical connection may result; use of eutectic\nsolder reduces this problem. The pasty state of a non-eutectic solder can be\nexploited in plumbing as it allows molding of the solder during cooling, e.g.\nfor ensuring watertight joint of pipes, resulting in a so-called 'wiped joint'.\n\nFor electrical and electronics work solder wire is available in a range of\nthicknesses for hand-soldering, and with cores containing flux. It is also\navailable as a paste or as a preformed foil shaped to match the workpiece, more\nsuitable for mechanized mass-production. Alloys of lead and tin were universally\nused in the past, and are still available; they are particularly convenient for\nhand-soldering. Lead-free solder, somewhat less convenient for hand-soldering,\nis often used to avoid the environmental effect of lead.\n\nPlumbers often use bars of solder, much thicker than the wire used for\nelectrical applications. Jewelers often use solder in thin sheets which they cut\ninto snippets.\n\nThe word solder comes from the Middle English word soudur, via Old French\nsolduree and soulder, from the Latin solidare, meaning \"to make\nsolid\".\n\nWith the reduction of the size of circuit board features, the size of\ninterconnects shrinks as well. Current densities above 10 4\nA/cm 2 are often achieved and electromigration becomes a concern. At\nsuch current densities the Sn63Pb37 solder balls form hillocks on the anode side\nand voids on the cathode side; the increased content of lead on the anode side\nsuggests lead is the primary migrating species.\n\nContact with molten solder can cause 'solder embrittlement' of materials, a type\nof liquid metal embrittlement.\n","linknr":1294,"url":"Glass_solder","recorded":1362481753,"links":47,"instances":["semiconductors","chemistry","metallurgy","material","physics","engine_cooling","metallurgy","integrated_circuit"],"pdf":["http://www.smarttec.de/download/Legierungs-Info.pdf","http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/315929.pdf","http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_Ch4_final.pdf","http://www.kovopb.cz/userdata/pages/12/dp-solders_pb.pdf","http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/Solder_Sn63Pb37.pdf","http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/Solder_Sn63PbP.pdf","http://www.balverzinn.com/tl_files/balverzinn/downloads/datenblaetter_en/Solder%20SN97C.pdf","http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/Solder_SN96C.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20061016044946/http://www.aimsolder.com/pdf/The+Fluidity+of+the+Ni-Modified+Sn-Cu+Eutectic+Lead+Free+Solder.pdf","http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/Solder_SCA.pdf","http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/Solder_Sn97Cu3.pdf","http://www.indium.com/gold/files/2010/12/98217.pdf","http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/DESOXY_RSN_GB.pdf","http://nepp.nasa.gov/wirebond/literatures/na-gsfc-2004-01.pdf","http://www.indium.com/products/alloy_sorted_by_temperature.pdf"],"categories":["Fusible
