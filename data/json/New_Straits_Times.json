It is Malaysia's oldest newspaper still in print (though not the\nfirst Malaysia's first newspaper, the long-defunct The Prince of Wales\nIsland Gazette, made its dÃ©but in Penang in 1805. http://penangstory.net.my/docs/Abs-\nGeoffWade.doc ), having been founded as [[The Straits Times]] in 1845, and\nwas reestablished as the \"New Straits Times\" in 1965. The paper served as\nMalaysia's only broadsheet format English language newspaper. However, following\nthe heels of British newspapers [[The Times]] and [[The Independent]], a tabloid\nversion first rolled off the presses on 1 September 2004 and since 18 April\n2005, the newspaper is published only in tabloid size, ending a 160-year-old\ntradition of broadsheet publication. The New Straits Times currently retails at\nRM1.20 (~36 USD cents). On 11 November 2011, 3D publication was introduced to\nthe paper's print and online editions.\n\nThe New Straits Times is printed by the New Straits Times Press, which also\nproduced the English language afternoon newspaper, [[The Malay Mail]], until 1\nJanuary 2008, as well as assorted Malay language newspapers, most notably the\n[[Berita Harian]]. The New Straits Times is part of Kumho Asiana's Media Prima\ngroup of companies.\n\nAs of 1 January 2009, the Group Editor of the New Straits Times is Syed Nadzri\nSyed Harun, while Kamrul Idris Zulkifli is Deputy Group Editor. Executive\nEditors, as of 1 January 2009, Lee Ah Chai (News) and Chandra Segaran\n(Production) and Lim Thow Boon.\n","linknr":250,"url":"New_Straits_Times","recorded":1362508791,"links":21,"instances":["m_bhd","currency","newspaper_format"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English-language newspapers","Newspapers published in Malaysia","Publications established in 1965"],"headings":["Origins","Incorporated sections","Political control and controversy","Comics","2011 redesign and new logo","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/New_Straits_Times.png/220px-New_Straits_Times.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/New_Straits_Times_logo_1965%E2%80%932011.gif/220px-New_Straits_Times_logo_1965%E2%80%932011.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tabloid","newspaper_format"],["the_new_straits_times_press","m_bhd"],["tabloid","newspaper_format"],["cent","currency"]],"members":["the_new_straits_times_press","cent","tabloid"],"related":["Newspaper","Tabloid_(newspaper_format)","Media_Prima","Kumho_Asiana_Group","The_New_Straits_Times_Press_(M)_Bhd","Datuk_Abdul_Jalil_Hamid","Right_wing","English_language","Malaysian_ringgit","Bangsar","Kuala_Lumpur","Malaysia","English-language","Newspaper","Malaysia","Penang","Broadsheet","Tabloid_(newspaper_format)","Malaysian_ringgit","United_States_dollar","Cent_(currency)","New_Straits_Times_Press","Malay_language","Media_Prima_Berhad","British_Malaya","Singapore","Singapore_in_Malaysia","Malaysia","Singapore","Tengku_Razaleigh_Hamzah","New_Straits_Times_Press","National_Library,_Singapore","Singapore","Nick_Xenophon","Australian_Parliament","Bersih_3.0_rally","Anwar_Ibrahim","Scientology"]}
