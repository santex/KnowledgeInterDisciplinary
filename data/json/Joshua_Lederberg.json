He was just 33 years old when\nhe won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering that\nbacteria can mate and exchange genes.

This included work in the NASA experimental programs\nseeking life on Mars and the chemistry expert system Dendral.\n","linknr":905,"url":"Joshua_Lederberg","recorded":1362506407,"links":63,"instances":["crater","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/lederberg-joshua.pdf"],"categories":["1925 births","Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences","2008 deaths","Deaths from pneumonia","American geneticists","American Nobel laureates","Artificial intelligence researchers","Columbia University alumni","Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Jewish American scientists","Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences","National Medal of Science laureates","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","People from Montclair, New Jersey","Phage workers","Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients","Stanford University School of Medicine faculty","Stuyvesant High School alumni","University of Wisconsin–Madison faculty","Yale University alumni","People from Washington Heights, Manhattan","Infectious disease deaths in New York","Presidents of Rockefeller University"],"headings":["Early life and education","Bacterial genetics","Post Nobel Prize research","Personal","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Joshua_Lederberg-nih.jpg/220px-Joshua_Lederberg-nih.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Joshua_Lederberg_and_George_Bush.jpg/240px-Joshua_Lederberg_and_George_Bush.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transduction","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["lederberg","crater"]],"members":["lederberg","transduction"],"related":["Montclair,_New_Jersey","NewYork-Presbyterian_Hospital","United_States","Microbiologist","Stuyvesant_High_School","Columbia_University","Yale_University","Neurospora_crassa","Bacterial_conjugation","Dendral","Astrobiology","Transduction_(genetics)","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","National_Medal_of_Science","Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom","Esther_Lederberg","Royal_Society","United_States","Molecular_biology","Artificial_intelligence","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Bacteria","Kevin_Warwick","Edward_L._Tatum","George_Beadle","Biology","Artificial_intelligence","NASA","Mars","Chemistry","Expert_system","Dendral","Montclair,_New_Jersey","Jewish","Rabbi","Washington_Heights,_Manhattan","Stuyvesant_High_School","New_York_City","Westinghouse_Science_Talent_Search","Columbia_University","Malaria","Columbia_University_College_of_Physicians_and_Surgeons","Oswald_Avery","Avery-MacLeod-McCarty_experiment","DNA","Cloning","Edward_Tatum","Yale_University","Bacterium","Bacterial_conjugation","Chromosome","Yale_University","University_of_Wisconsin–Madison","Esther_Lederberg","Norton_Zinder","Transduction_(genetics)","Transduction_(genetics)","Antibiotic","Esther_Lederberg","Luigi_Luca_Cavalli-Sforza","Stanford_University","Frank_Macfarlane_Burnet","National_Academies_of_Sciences","Carl_Sagan","Exobiology","Edward_Feigenbaum","Dendral","Rockefeller_University","Emeritus","Bioinformatics","Defense_Science_Board","Jimmy_Carter","National_Medal_of_Science","Gulf_War_Syndrome","Benjamin_Franklin_Medal_for_Distinguished_Achievement_in_the_Sciences","American_Philosophical_Society","Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom","Lederberg_(crater)","Xanthe_Terra","Mars","Esther_Lederberg","List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates","LCF_notation","Montclair,_New_Jersey","NewYork-Presbyterian_Hospital"]}
