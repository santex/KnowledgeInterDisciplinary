{"cursor":"67395","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":1210,"url":"Social_science","article":"\n\n\n'Social science' refers to the academic disciplines concerned with society and\nhuman nature. \"Social science\" is commonly used as an umbrella term to refer to\nanthropology, archaeology, criminology, economics, linguistics, law,\ncommunication studies, history, political science, sociology, human geography,\npsychiatry, and psychology.\n\nThe term may however be used in the specific context of referring to the\noriginal science of society established in 19th century sociology (Latin:\n[[wiktionary:socius|socius]], \"companion\"; Greek , lÃ³gos, \"word\", \"knowledge\",\n\"study.\"). Ãmile Durkheim, Karl Marx and Max Weber are typically cited as the\nprincipal architects of modern social science by this\ndefinition. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/ Max Weber - Stanford\nEncyclopaedia of Philosophy] Positivist social scientists use methods\nresembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and\nso define science in its stricter modern sense. Interpretivist social\nscientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation\nrather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat\nscience in its broader sense. In modern academic practice, researchers are often\neclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining the\nquantitative and qualitative techniques). The term social research has also\nacquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in\nits aims and methods.\n","recorded":1362124611,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"1211","instances":["biophysical","mathematics","mathematics","philosopher","international_relations","linguistics","linguistics","book","philosophy","sociology","sociology","social_science","aristotle","psychology","science","literature","legal_philosopher","physics","sociology","population","soil_study","social_sciences","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/richerson/Prolegomena%204%200.pdf","http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/There_is_No_Such_Thing_as_a_Social_Science_Intro.pdf"],"categories":["Academic
