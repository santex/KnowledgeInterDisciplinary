There are over 1000 known members with a\nvariety of functions. The RTX family is defined by two common features:\ncharacteristic repeats in the toxin protein sequences, and extracellular\nsecretion by the type I secretion system (T1SS). The name RTX (repeats in toxin)\nrefers to the glycine and aspartate-rich repeats located at the C-terminus of\nthe toxin proteins, which facilitate export by a dedicated T1SS encoded within\nthe rtx operon.\n","linknr":177,"url":"RTX_toxin","recorded":1362486604,"links":11,"instances":["biology","t1ss_or_toss"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacterial toxins"],"headings":["Structure and function","Subgroups","Examples","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/T1SS_assembly_operation.png/220px-T1SS_assembly_operation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["secretion#type_i_secretion_system","t1ss_or_toss"],["homology","biology"]],"members":["homology"],"related":["Cytotoxicity","Gram-negative_bacteria","Protein_sequence","Glycine","Aspartic_acid","C-terminus","Operon","Amino_acid","Cellular_transport","Adenosine_triphosphate","Operon","ABC_transporter","Acyltransferase","Post-translational_modification","Hemolysin","Leukotoxin","Pathogenic_Escherichia_coli","Virulence_factor","Urinary_tract_infection","Acyltransferase","Enterohaemorrhagic","Serotype","Homology_(biology)","Shiga_toxins","Endothelium","Cytoskeleton","Rho_family_of_GTPases","Phytic_acid","Macrophage-1_antigen"]}
