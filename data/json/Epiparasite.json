{"cursor":"28977","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n is a form of parasitism]] 'Parasitism' is a non-mutual relationship between\n organisms of different species where one organism, the 'parasite', benefits at\n the expense of the other, the host. Traditionally parasite referred to\n organisms with lifestages that needed more than one host (e.g. [[Taenia\n solium]]). These are now called macroparasites (typically protozoa and\n helminths). Parasite now also refers to microparasites, which are typically\n smaller, such as viruses and bacteria, and can be directly transmitted between\n hosts of the same species. Claude Combes, The Art of being a\n Parasite, U. of Chicago Press, 2005 Examples of parasites include the\n plants mistletoe and cuscuta, and organisms such as hookworms.\n\nUnlike predators, parasites are generally much smaller than their host; both are\nspecial cases of consumer-resource interactions. Getz, W. (2011). Biomass\ntransformation webs provide a unified approach to consumerâresource modelling.\nEcology Letters, . Parasites show a high degree of specialization, and\nreproduce at a faster rate than their hosts. Classic examples of parasitism\ninclude interactions between vertebrate hosts and diverse animals such as\ntapeworms, flukes, the [[Plasmodium]] species, and fleas.\n\nParasitism is differentiated from the parasitoid relationship by the fact that\nparasitoids generally kill their hosts. Parasitoidism occurs in a similar\nvariety of organisms to that in which parasitism occurs.\n\nParasites reduce host biological fitness by general or specialized pathology,\nsuch as parasitic castration and impairment of secondary sex characteristics, to\nthe modification of host behaviour. Parasites increase their fitness by\nexploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, e.g. food, water,\nheat, habitat, and transmission.\n\nAlthough parasitism applies unambiguously to many cases, it is part of a\ncontinuum of types of interactions between species, rather than an exclusive\ncategory. Particular interactions between species may satisfy some but not all\nparts of the definition. In many cases, it is difficult to demonstrate that the\nhost is harmed. In others, there may be no apparent specialization on the part\nof the parasite, or the interaction between the organisms may be short-lived.\n","linknr":549,"url":"Epiparasite","recorded":1362372986,"links":80,"instances":["biology","literature","biology","medicine","human","epidemiology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.zoologia.hu/list/quant_large.pdf","http://www.actavetscand.com/content/pdf/1751-0147-52-S1-S7.pdf"],"categories":["Parasitism|*","Parasitology"],"headings":["Etymology","Types","Host
