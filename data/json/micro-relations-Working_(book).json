noted oral historian and radio\nbroadcaster Studs Terkel.\n\nIt is an exploration of what makes work meaningful for people in all walks of\nlife: from Lovin' Al the parking valet, to Dolores the waitress, from the\nfireman to the business executive, the narratives move constantly between\nmundane details, emotional truths and existential questioning.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Working_(book)","recorded":1363408383,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Working_(book)&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:WorkingStudsTerkel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/WorkingStudsTerkel.jpg/220px-WorkingStudsTerkel.jpg","/wiki/File:WorkingStudsTerkel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Pantheon_Books","/wiki/Oral_historian","/wiki/Studs_Terkel","#Structure","#Book_One","#Book_Two","#Book_Three","#Book_Four","#Book_Five","#Book_Six","#Book_Seven","#Book_Eight","#Book_Nine","#Famous_names","#General_themes","#Spinoffs","#References_in_popular_culture","#Bibliography","#References","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=10","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=11","/wiki/Steve_Hamilton","/wiki/Rip_Torn","/wiki/George_Allen_(American_football_coach)","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=12","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=13","/wiki/Broadway_musical","/wiki/Working_(musical)","/w/index.php?title=Gig:_Americans_Talk_About_Their_Jobs&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Harvey_Pekar","/wiki/Graphic_novel","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=14","/wiki/The_Second_City","#cite_note-1","/wiki/James_Taylor","/wiki/Flag_(James_Taylor_album)","/wiki/The_Facts_of_Life_(TV_series)","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=15","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0394478845","/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&action=edit&section=16","#cite_ref-1","http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2009/07/studs-terkels-not-working-everyday-chicagoans-are-back-in-the-spotlight-at-etc.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Working:_People_Talk_About_What_They_Do_All_Day_and_How_They_Feel_About_What_They_Do&oldid=543855551","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1974_books","/wiki/Category:Social_history","/wiki/Category:Oral_history_books","/wiki/Category:Books_about_labor_history","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_invalid_ISBNs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Working%3A+People+Talk+About+What+They+Do+All+Day+and+How+They+Feel+About+What+They+Do&type=signup","/w/index.php?ti
