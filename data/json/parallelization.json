There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level,\ninstruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for\nmany years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown\nlately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.<ref>S.V.\nAdve et al.

Parallel@Illinois,\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"The main techniques for these\nperformance benefits&nbsp;– increased clock frequency and smarter but\nincreasingly complex architectures&nbsp;– are now hitting the so-called power\nwall. The computer industry has accepted that future performance increases must\nlargely come from increasing the number of processors (or cores) on a die,\nrather than making a single core go faster.\"</ref> As power consumption (and\nconsequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent\nyears,<ref>Asanovic et al. Old [conventional wisdom]: Power is free, but\ntransistors are expensive. New [conventional wisdom] is [that] power is\nexpensive, but transistors are \"free\".</ref> parallel computing has become the\ndominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multicore\nprocessors.<ref name=\"View-Power\">Asanovic, Krste et al. (December 18, 2006).\n[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.pdf \"The\nLandscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley\"] (PDF).\nUniversity of California, Berkeley. Technical Report No. UCB/EECS-2006-183. \"Old\n[conventional wisdom]: Increasing clock frequency is the primary method of\nimproving processor performance. New [conventional wisdom]: Increasing\nparallelism is the primary method of improving processor performance&nbsp;...\nEven representatives from Intel, a company generally associated with the 'higher\nclock-speed is better' position, warned that traditional approaches to\nmaximizing performance through maximizing clock speed have been pushed to their\nlimit.\"</ref>\n\nParallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the\nhardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers\nhaving multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters,\nMPPs, and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized\nparallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional\nprocessors, for accelerating specific tasks.\n\nParallel computer programs are more difficult to write than sequential\nones,<ref></ref> because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential\nsoftware bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and\nsynchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the\ngreatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.\n\nThe maximum possible speed-up of a program as a result of parallelization is\nknown as Amdahl's law.\n","title":"Parallel%20computing","headings":["Background","Types of parallelism","Hardware","Software","Algorithmic
