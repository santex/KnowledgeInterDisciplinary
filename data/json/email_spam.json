Clicking on links in spam email may send users to phishing\nweb sites or sites that are hosting malware. Spam email may also include malware\nas scripts or other executable file attachments. Definitions of spam usually\ninclude the aspects that email is unsolicited and sent in bulk. One subset of UBE is UCE\n(unsolicited commercial email). The opposite of \"spam\", email which one wants,\nis called \"ham\", usually when referring to a message's automated analysis (such\nas Bayesian filtering). Like other forms of unwanted bulk messaging,\nit is named for Spam luncheon meat by way of a Monty Python sketch in which Spam\nis depicted as ubiquitous and unavoidable.\n\nEmail spam has steadily grown since the early 1990s. Botnets, networks of virus-\ninfected computers, are used to send about 80% of spam. Since the expense of the\nspam is borne mostly by the recipient, it is effectively\npostage due advertising.\n\nThe legal status of spam varies from one jurisdiction to another. In the United\nStates, spam was declared to be legal by the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 provided the\nmessage adheres to certain specifications. ISPs have attempted to recover the\ncost of spam through lawsuits against spammers, although they have been mostly\nunsuccessful in collecting damages despite winning in court.\n\nSpammers collect email addresses from chatrooms, websites, customer lists,\nnewsgroups, and viruses which harvest users' address books, and are sold to\nother spammers. They also use a practice known as \"email appending\" or\n\"epending\" in which they use known information about their target (such as a\npostal address) to search for the target's email address. Much of spam is sent\nto invalid email addresses. Spam averages 78% of all email sent. According to the Message Anti-Abuse Working Group, the\namount of spam email was between 88â92% of email messages sent in the first half\nof 2010.\n","linknr":664,"url":"email_spam","recorded":1367713449,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:CITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:V","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Editing","/wiki/Talk:Email_spam","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/File:Spammed-mail-folder.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Spammed-mail-folder.png/300px-Spammed-mail-folder.png","/wiki/File:Spammed-mail-folder.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf2/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Email_box","/wiki/Spam_(electronic)","/wiki/Email","/wiki/Html_email#Security_vulnerabilities","/wiki/Phishing","/wiki/Malware","#cite_note-spamfaq-1","#cite_note-rhyolite-2","#cite_note-spamcop-3","#cite_note-abuse-4","#cite_note-monkeys-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Spam_(electronic)","/wiki/Spam","/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python)","/wiki/Botnet","/wiki/Computer_virus","#cite_note-spam-costs-7","/wiki/Postage_due","/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003","/wiki/Internet_service_provider","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-AOL_gives_up_treasure_hunt-9","#cite_note-NYTimes.com-10","#cite_note-MAAWG.org-11","#Overview","#Types","#Spamvertised_sites","#Most_common_products_advertised","#419_scams","#Phishing","#Spam_techniques","#Appending","#Image_spam","#Blank_spam","#Backscatter_spam","#Legality","#European_Union","#Canada","#Australia","#United_States","#Other_laws","#Deception_and_fraud","#Theft_of_service","#Side_effects","#Statistics_and_estimates","#Highest_amount_of_spam_received","#Cost_of_spam","#Origin_of_spam","#Anti-spam_techniques","#How_spammers_operate","#Gathering_of_addresses","#Delivering_spam_messages","#Obfuscating_message_content","#Spam-support_services","#Related_vocabulary","#History","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/ARPANET","/wiki/Gary_Thuerk","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Terms_of_Service","/wiki/Acceptable_use_policy","#cite_note-13","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/File:Mutt.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Mutt.png/300px-Mutt.png","/wiki/File:Mutt.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf2/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mutt_(email_client)","/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Commtouch","#cite_note-commtouch-17","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-commtouch-17","#cite_note-commtouch-17","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Advance_fee_fraud","/wiki/Cyber_cafe","/wiki/Gang","/wiki/Russian_mafia","#cite_note-wired-18","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Phishing","/wiki/Fraudster","/wiki/Scam","/wiki/PayPal","/wiki/Phishing","#cite_note-sophos8-19","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=7","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Email_appending","#cite_note-20","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Image_spam","/wiki/Image_spam","#cite_note-Image_Based_spam_name-21","#cite_note-Image_Based_spam_name_2-22","/wiki/GIF","/wiki/JPEG","/wiki/Pump_and_dump","#cite_note-techtarget-23","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/GIF","/wiki/CAPTCHA","/wiki/Optical_character_recognition","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Directory_harvest_attack","/wiki/Dictionary_attack","#cite_note-24","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=11","/wiki/Backscatter_(email)","/wiki/Computer_viruses","/wiki/Computer_worm","/wiki/Bounce_message","/wiki/Envelope_sender","/wiki/DNSBL","/wiki/Internet_service_provider","/wiki/Terms_of_Service","/w/index.php?title=Email_spam&action=edit&section=12","/wiki/Email_spam_legislation_by_country","/wiki/Acceptable_use_policy","/wiki/Internet_service_provider","#cite_note-spam-costs-7","#cite_note-25","#
