{"cursor":"4002","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In physics and engineering, in particular fluid dynamics and hydrometry, the\n'volumetric flow rate', (also known as 'volume flow rate', 'rate of fluid flow'\nor 'volume velocity') is the volume of fluid which passes through a given\nsurface per unit time. The SI unit is m 3Â·s â1 (cubic meters\nper second). In US Customary Units and British Imperial Units, volumetric flow\nrate is often expressed as ft 3/s (cubic feet per second). It is\nusually represented by the symbol Q.\n\nVolumetric flow rate should not be confused with volumetric flux, as defined by\nDarcy's law and represented by the symbol q, with units of\nm 3/(m 2Â·s), that is, mÂ·s â1 . The integration of a\nflux over an area gives the volumetric flow rate.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Volumetric_flow_rate","recorded":1362482179,"links":27,"instances":["geometry","geometry","hydrology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fluid dynamics"],"headings":["Fundamental definition","Useful definition","Related quantities","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/e/1aef39f72bcf6e80ea096fdca1c7e61a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/7/6/676d494528c3cce3218bbe525fdd12d5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/a/87a7186ff24530d26c46a15680c3d92c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/8/0/18049261a6aedb1158ebb8dfe6d1217b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/8/4/684de48433296da6ab932f8d9804ac69.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/5/7/f5732e70c75f528ac42c6b0ae8ca52d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/8/0/18049261a6aedb1158ebb8dfe6d1217b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/a/93a4d3e2443c7e649d1fd9627795a36c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/0/7/1074fd5594283e95bc263291e848ce43.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cross_section","geometry"],["parallel","geometry"],["discharge","hydrology"]],"members":["cross_section","parallel","discharge"],"related":["Physics","Engineering","Fluid_dynamics","Hydrometry","SI_unit","Cubic_meters_per_second","US_Customary_Units","British_Imperial_Units","Cubic_foot","Volumetric_flux","Darcy's_law","Limit_of_a_function","Volume","Velocity_field","Cross_section_(geometry)","Vector_area","Surface_integral","Area","Vector_area","Unit_vector","Parallel_(geometry)","Perpendicular","Mass_flow_rate","Air_to_cloth_ratio","Darcy's_law","Discharge_(hydrology)","Flow_measurement","Flowmeter","Flux","Mass_flow_rate","Orifice_plate","Poiseuille's_law","Stokes_flow"]}
