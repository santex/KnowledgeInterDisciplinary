{"cursor":"17206","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'by-election' (occasionally also spelled 'bye-election', and known in the\nUnited States, Palau, Micronesia and sometimes in Liberia http://allafrica.com/stories/201301150575.html?aa_source=acrdn-\nf0  and the Philippines as a 'special election') is an election held to\nfill a political office that has become vacant between regularly scheduled\nelections.\n\nUsually, a by-election occurs when the incumbent has died or resigned. It may\nalso occur when the incumbent becomes ineligible to continue in office, for\nexample because of a recall, ennoblement, a serious criminal conviction, failure\nto maintain a minimum attendance, bankruptcy or mental incapacity. By-elections\nhave also been called as a result of a constituency election being invalidated\nby voting irregularities; see Oldham East and Saddleworth election petition.\n\nHistorically, members of some parliaments were required to seek re-election upon\nbeing appointed to a ministerial post. The subsequent by-elections were termed\n\"ministerial by-elections\". These by-elections were usually a formality as they\nwere normally, but not always, uncontested by opposition parties. The\nrequirement for Members of Parliament (MPs) to resign their seats and re-offer\nupon being appointed to Cabinet was done away with as an anachronism in most\nWestminster systems by the mid-20th century. Re-election was required under\nthe Succession to the Crown Act 1707. The Re-Election of Ministers Act 1919\nseverely restricted the necessity to seek re-election on appointment to\ngovernment office. The Re-Election of Ministers Act (1919) Amendment Act 1926\nended the practice.
