Some caspases are also\nrequired in the immune system for the maturation of lymphocytes. Failure of\napoptosis is one of the main contributions to tumour development and autoimmune\ndiseases; this, coupled with the unwanted apoptosis that occurs with ischemia or\nAlzheimer's disease, has stimulated interest in caspases as potential\ntherapeutic targets since they were discovered in the mid-1990s.\n","linknr":452,"url":"Caspase","recorded":1362484440,"links":31,"instances":["genetics","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.4.22","Programmed cell death","Apoptosis","Peptidase"],"headings":["Types of caspase proteins","Caspase cascade","Discovery of caspases, functions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/PDB_1ice_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1ice_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Signal_transduction_pathways.svg/480px-Signal_transduction_pathways.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["translation","genetics"],["cell","journal"]],"members":["translation","cell"],"related":["Cysteine_protease","Apoptosis","Necrosis","Inflammation","Cell_(biology)","Apoptosis","Developmental_biology","Immune_system","Lymphocytes","Tumour","Ischemia","Alzheimer's_disease","Caspase_2","CASP2","CASP8","CASP9","CASP10","CASP3","CASP6","CASP7","CASP4","CASP5","Vitiligo","CASP1","T-cell","Translation_(genetics)","CARD_domain","Death_effector_domain","Granzyme_B","Cytotoxic_T_lymphocyte","NK_cells","Fas_ligand","TRAIL","Tumor_necrosis_factor_receptor","Apoptosome","Cytochrome_c","Bcl-2","Caspase-9","Lamin","Queensland","Caspase_1","Robert_Horvitz","Nematode","Mammal","Cell_(journal)","Red_blood_cell","Myoblast","Apoptosis","Apoptosome","Bcl-2","Metacaspase","Paracaspase","Pyroptosis","The_Proteolysis_Map","Programmed_cell_death"]}
