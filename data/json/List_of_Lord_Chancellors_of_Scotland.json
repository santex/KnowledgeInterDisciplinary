{"cursor":"8072","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Lord Chancellor of Scotland' was a Great Officer of State in pre-\nUnion Scotland.\n\nHolders of the office are known from 1123 onwards, but its duties were\noccasionally performed by an official of lower status with the title of Keeper\nof the Great Seal. From the 15th century, the Chancellor was normally a Bishop\nor a Peer.\n\nAt the Union, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England became the first Lord\nHigh Chancellor of Great Britain, but the Earl of Seafield continued as Lord\nChancellor of Scotland until 1708. He was re-appointed in 1713 and sat as an\nExtraordinary Lord of Session in that capacity until his death in 1730.\n\nIt has been argued that the office is only in abeyance and could potentially be\nrevived. In the event of Scottish independence, the Scottish National Party\nproposes that the title Chancellor of Scotland be used instead of Presiding\nOfficer of the Scottish Parliament, with additional constitutional powers\nduring the absence of the Monarch from Scotland.
