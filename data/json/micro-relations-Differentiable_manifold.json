The notion of a\n differentiable manifold refines that of a manifold by requiring the functions\n that transform between charts to be differentiable.]]\n\nIn mathematics, a 'differentiable manifold' is a type of manifold that is\nlocally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus. Any\nmanifold can be described by a collection of charts, also known as an atlas. One\nmay then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts,\nsince each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus\napply. If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one\nchart to another is differentiable), then computations done in one chart are\nvalid in any other differentiable chart.\n\nIn formal terms, a 'differentiable manifold' is a topological manifold with a\nglobally defined differential structure. Any topological manifold can be given a\ndifferential structure locally by using the homeomorphisms in its atlas and the\nstandard differential structure on a linear space. To induce a global\ndifferential structure on the local coordinate systems induced by the\nhomeomorphisms, their composition on chart intersections in the atlas must be\ndifferentiable functions on the corresponding linear space. In other words,\nwhere the domains of charts overlap, the coordinates defined by each chart are\nrequired to be differentiable with respect to the coordinates defined by every\nchart in the atlas. The maps that relate the coordinates defined by the various\ncharts to one another are called transition maps.\n\nDifferentiability means different things in different contexts including:\ncontinuously differentiable, k times differentiable, and holomorphic.\nFurthermore, the ability to induce such a differential structure on an\nabstract space allows one to extend the definition of differentiability to\nspaces without global coordinate systems. A differential structure allows one\nto define the globally differentiable tangent space, differentiable\nfunctions, and differentiable tensor and vector fields. Differentiable\nmanifolds are very important in physics. Special kinds of differentiable\nmanifolds form the basis for physical theories such as classical mechanics,\ngeneral relativity, and YangâMills theory. It is possible to develop a\ncalculus for differentiable manifolds. This leads to such mathematical\nmachinery as the exterior calculus. The study of calculus on differentiable\nmanifolds is known as differential
