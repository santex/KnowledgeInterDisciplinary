{"cursor":"19717","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In electrical engineering, 'ground' or 'earth' can refer to the reference point\nin an electrical circuit from which other voltages are measured, or a common\nreturn path for electric current, or a direct physical connection to the Earth.\n\n.  Electrical codes specify that earthing wires must be a certain color, to\n   prevent wiring errors.]]\n\nElectrical circuits may be connected to ground (earth) for several reasons. In\nmains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent\nuser contact with dangerous voltage if electrical insulation fails. Connections\nto ground limit the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable\nproducts or electrostatic-sensitive devices.\n\nIn some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used\nas one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return\nconductor. (See single-wire earth return)\n\nFor measurement purposes, the Earth serves as a (reasonably) constant potential\nreference against which other potentials can be measured. An electrical ground\nsystem should have an appropriate current-carrying capability to serve as an\nadequate zero-voltage reference level. In electronic circuit theory, a \"ground\"\nis usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb\nan unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real\nground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero\npotential is no longer valid. Stray voltages or earth potential rise effects\nwill occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an\nelectric shock hazard.\n\nThe use of the term ground (or earth) is so common in electrical and electronics\napplications that circuits in portable electronic devices such as cell phones\nand media players as well as circuits in vehicles may be spoken of as having a\n\"ground\" connection without any actual connection to the Earth. This is usually\na large conductor attached to one side of the power supply (such as the \"ground\nplane\" on a printed circuit board) which serves as the common return path for\ncurrent from many different components in the circuit.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Ground_(electricity)","recorded":1362559836,"links":54,"instances":["power","electric_power","electricity","transmission_line"],"pdf":["http://www.jensen-transformers.com/an/generic%20seminar.pdf","http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/application_notes/6001142869552014948960492698455131755584673020828AN_345.pdf","http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/application_notes/135208865AN-202.pdf"],"categories":["Electric power","Electrical safety","Electrical wiring","Power cables","Electric power distribution"],"headings":["Synonyms","History","Radio communications","AC power wiring installations","Power transmission","Electronics","Lightning protection systems","Earthing system","Ground (earth) mat","Isolation","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/HomeEarthRodAustralia1.jpg/220px-HomeEarthRodAustralia1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Signal_Ground.svg/30px-Signal_Ground.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Chassis_Ground.svg/40px-Chassis_Ground.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Earth_Ground.svg/25px-Earth_Ground.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Busbars.jpg/220px-Busbars.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mains","electric_power"],["ground","power"],["ground_loop","electricity"],["ground_loop","electricity"],["ground_wire","transmission_line"]],"members":["ground","mains","ground_loop","ground_wire"],"related":["Electrical_engineering","Electrical_circuit","Electric_current","Earth","Electrical_code","Mains_(electric_power)","Electrical_insulation","Static_electricity","Electrostatic-sensitive_device","Telegraph","Power_transmission","Electrical_conductor","Single-wire_earth_return","Ground_and_neutral","Electronic_circuit","Current_sources_and_sinks","Stray_voltage","Earth_potential_rise","Portable_electronics","Cell_phone","Media_player","Vehicles","Power_supply","Ground_plane","Printed_circuit_board","Electrical_bonding","Carl_August_Steinheil","Saint_Joseph,_Missouri","Sacramento,_California","Ground_rod","Electrical_connection","Radio_frequency","Monopole_antenna","Capacitance","Electric_current","Electrical_impedance","Antennas","Monopole_antenna","Ground_plane","Mains_electricity","Ground_and_neutral","National_Electrical_Code","Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws","BS_7671","Neutral_wire","Water_supply","Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets","Single_wire_earth_return","Electrical_power_grid","HVDC","Electrical_substation","Earth_potential_rise","Extra_low_voltage","Voltage","Single-ended_signaling","Ground_(power)","Floating_ground","Television","Recording_studios","Ground_loop_(electricity)","Busbar","Lightning_protection_system","Electrical_substation","Appliance_classes","Body_earthing","Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets","Double_switching","Ground_constants","Ground_loop_(electricity)","Ground_wire_(transmission_line)","Isolated_ground","Phantom_circuit","Soil_resistivity","Ufer_Ground","Virtual_ground","Federal_Standard_1037C","MIL-STD-188","PDF","Analog_Devices"]}
