{"cursor":"24735","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":\"Sex drive\" redirects here. For other uses, see [[Sex drive (disambiguation)]].\n:For other uses, see [[Libido (disambiguation)]].\n\n\n\n'Libido' () refers to a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual\nactivity. Sex drive has usually biological, psychological, and social\ncomponents. Biologically, levels of hormones such as testosterone are believed\nto affect sex drive; social factors, such as work and family, also have an\nimpact; as do internal psychological factors, like personality and stress. Sex\ndrive may be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and\nrelationship issues. A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased\nsex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, but there is no measure of what is\na healthy level for sex. Asexual people may lack any sexual desires.\n\nA person may have a desire for sex but not have the opportunity to act on that\ndesire, or may on personal, moral or religious reasons refrain from acting on\nthe urge. Psychologically, a person's urge can be repressed or sublimated. On\nthe other hand, a person can engage in sexual activity without an actual desire\nfor it. Males reach the peak of their sex drive in their teens, while females\nreach it in their thirties.

A general desire for sex is an\nimportant motivator for the formation and maintenance of intimate relationships\nin both men and women, and a lack or loss of sexual desire can have an adverse\nimpact on a relationship. A general change in desire for sex by either partner\nin a relationship for any reason if sustained and unresolved may result in a\nlack or loss of sexual desire for the other partner, which may cause problems in\nthe relationship. Infidelity may be an indication of a continuing general desire\nfor sex, though not with the primary partner or because personal sexual needs\ncannot be satisfied adequately by that partner. Problems can arise from the loss\nof sexual desire in general or for the partner or a lack of connection with the\npartner, or poor communication of sexual needs and preferences.\n","linknr":582,"url":"Libido","recorded":1362373722,"links":64,"instances":["medicine","freud","disambiguation","psychology","psychology","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/neuroscience/BehavioralNeuroscience/Simerley-EFR-1-4.pdf","http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/neuroscience/BehavioralNeuroscience/Simerley-EFR-1-4.pdf"],"categories":["Psychodynamics","Motivation","Carl Jung","Philosophy of sexuality","Testosterone","Energy and instincts","Psychoanalytic terminology","Freudian psychology"],"headings":["Psychological perspectives","Factors","Medications","Testosterone and menstrual cycle","Sexual desire disorders","Endogenous substances involved in sex drive","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Freud-Museum.jpg/130px-Freud-Museum.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Sigmund_Freud_LIFE.jpg/160px-Sigmund_Freud_LIFE.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","psychology"],["psyche","psychology"],["fixation","psychology"],["sublimation","psychology"],["stress","medicine"],["consistency","disambiguation"],["eros","freud"],["sublimation","psychology"]],"members":["stress","eros","consistency","fixation","psyche","sublimation"],"related":["Human_sexual_activity","Hypersexuality","Asexuality","Psychological_repression","Sublimation_(psychology)","Intimate_relationship","Relationship_breakup","Infidelity","Sigmund_Freud","Id,_Ego_and_Superego","Psyche_(psychology)","Karl_Abraham","Superego","Ego_defenses","Neurosis","Psychoanalysis","Consciousness","Psychosexual_development","Fixation_(psychology)","Sublimation_(psychology)","Carl_Jung","Human_sexual_activity","Antonym","Destrudo","Privacy","Intimacy","Stress_(medicine)","Noise_health_effects","Over-illumination","Sexual_performance_anxiety","Irvin_D._Yalom","Oral_contraceptive_pill","Hypothyroidism","Flutamide","Underweight","Malnourished","Anemia","Iron","Smoking","Alcohol_abuse","Drug_abuse","Exercising","Quitting_smoking","Stress_management","Aphrodisiacs","Consistency_(disambiguation)","Iatrogenic","Hormonal_contraception","Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor","Antidepressants","Antipsychotic","Opioid","Beta_blocker","Iatrogenesis","Impotence","Sexual_dysfunction","Post-SSRI_sexual_dysfunction","Testosterone","Oral_contraceptive_pill","Estrogen","Progesterone","Sex_hormone_binding_globulin","Menstrual_cycle","Ovulation","Testosterone","Progesterone","Endometrium","Nerve_endings","Estrogen","Vaginal_lubrication","Menopause","Estrogen","Testosterone","Hypoactive_sexual_desire_disorder","Asexual","Erectile_dysfunction","American_Medical_Association","Female_sexual_arousal_disorder","Luteinising_hormone","Birth","Genital_area","Sexual_intercourse","Vagina","Vulva","Atrophy","Frustration","Surgery","Arthritis","Cancer","Diabetes","High_blood_pressure","Coronary_artery_disease","Infertility","Hysterectomies","5-HT1A_agonist","Endogenous","Serotonin","Acetylcholine","Androgens","Testosterone","Cortisol","Dopamine","Estrogens","Estradiol","MC4R","Î‘-Melanocyte-stimulating_hormone","Oxytocin","Progesterone","Ovulation","Serotonin","Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor","Neurotransmitter","Sex_hormone-binding_globulin","Aphrodisiac","Cathexis","Coitus_reservatus","Destrudo","Eros_(Freud)","Giles'_theory_of_sexual_desire","Id,_ego,_and_super-ego","Lust","Mortido","Orgastic_potency","Perimenopause","Psychological_repression","Psychosexual_development","Reward_system","Sexual_arousal","Sexual_attraction","Sexual_desire","Sexual_motivation_and_hormones","Sublimation_(psychology)","Henri_Ellenberger"]}
