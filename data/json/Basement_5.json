Their\nfirst vocalist was Winston Fergus, then Don Letts. One of their early\nperformances was a support for Public Image Ltd.'s London debut at the Rainbow\non Christmas Day 1978. Finally in 1979 Dennis Morris - legendary photographer of\nBob Marley and the Sex Pistols, took over as creative force, lead vocalist and\nlyricist. He also designed the Basement 5 logo and created their image. The\ndrums were played by Richard Dudanski, who had played in the bands 101ers, The\nRaincoats and Public Image Ltd. Their songs reflected the political situation of\nthe time in Great Britain in the era of Margaret Thatcher: youth unemployment,\nstrikes, racism and the poverty of the working class.\n\nIn 1980 they got signed to Island Records with vocalist Dennis Morris. The new\nline up played its debut gig at Clarendon Hotel in London (19 March\n1980), Look Hear. In: Melody Maker 22 March 1980, page 32. Moving\nFinger: After Midnight. In: Melody Maker 29 March 1980, page 13. followed\nby a fantastic set at Camdens Music Machine, Now called [http://www.koko.uk.com/\nKoko] at an all night gig hosted by ZigZag magazines editor Kris Needs on 31\nMarch 1980 along with numerous other artists such as John Cooper Clarke, Killing\nJoke & The Only Ones also recording a Peel Session on 21 April 1980, aired on 28\nApril and their debut, self-produced single, \"Silicon Chip,\" on 26 May.\nFollowing this, they recorded their debut album, 1965-1980, with record producer\nMartin Hannett, releasing it on 11 August. On the first day of recording the\nalbum, the existing drummer known as Bigga walked out of the session. The band\nwas in shock. Having just finished touring with Ian Dury and the Blockheads who\nthey became very friendly with, they then used their drummer \"Gentleman\" Charles\nCharles of the Blockheads for the album.\n\nHannett, in an interview with Dutch music magazine [[Oor]] in 1981, said, \"You\nhave to play it very loud to enjoy it fully. It was the most difficult\nproduction, I must say, the heaviest. It was eighteen degrees in the shade, the\nend of August. As I recall it has been the most physical album that I've ever\ndone. Made me feel like I'd been carrying bricks around. Heavy work. Putting the\nbass lines in the right place. But it was good.\"\n\nThe sessions also yielded dub reggae versions of several of the main tracks,\nreleased on 31 October as \"In Dub.\" \"Last White Christmas\" was released in time\nfor Christmas (1 December), as a 12\" and 7\" (the latter in Christmas wrapping\npaper with a silver sticker of the band logo). The band broke up shortly\nthereafter, with several members forming Urban Shakedown.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Basement_5","recorded":1375081359,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Reggae","/wiki/Punk_rock","/wiki/London","/wiki/Don_Letts","/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd.","/wiki/Rainbow_Theatre_(Finsbury_Park)","/wiki/Dennis_Morris_(photographer)","/wiki/Richard_Dudanski","/wiki/101ers","/wiki/The_Raincoats","/wiki/Public_Image_Ltd.","/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher","/wiki/Island_Records","/wiki/Dennis_Morris_(photographer)","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","http://www.koko.uk.com/","/wiki/ZigZag_(magazine)","/wiki/Kris_Needs","/wiki/John_Cooper_Clarke","/wiki/Killing_Joke","/wiki/The_Only_Ones","/wiki/Peel_Session","/wiki/Single_(music)","/wiki/Album","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Martin_Hannett","/wiki/Ian_Dury","/wiki/Oor","/wiki/Dub_reggae","#Main_members","#Other_members","#Discography","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Dennis_Morris_(photographer)","/wiki/Singing","/wiki/Guitar","/wiki/Leo_Williams_(musician)","/wiki/Bass_guitar","/wiki/Drum_kit","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Singing","/wiki/Don_Letts","/wiki/Singing","/wiki/Drum_kit","/wiki/Drum_kit","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Mini-LP","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Melody_Maker","#cite_ref-2","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit&section=5","http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=137956540","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&oldid=547443823","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:English_punk_rock_groups","/wiki/Category:Island_Records_artists","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1978","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_disestablished_in_1982","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_January_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Basement+5&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Basement+5","/wiki/Basement_5","/wiki/Talk:Basement_5","#","/wiki/Basement_5","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Basement_5","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Basement_5","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&oldid=547443823","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q809939","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Basement_5&id=547443823","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Basement+5","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Basement+5&oldid=547443823&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Basement_5&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basement_5","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q809939#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About",
