{"cursor":"3824","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Photostimulated luminescence' ('PSL') is the release of stored energy within\na phosphor by stimulation with visible light, to produce a luminescent signal.\nCommonly this is used to allow the storage of a weak radioactive signal in a\nphosphor plate that takes the place of X-ray film, potentially over a\nprolonged period, which PSL transforms to obtain a highly sensitive image of\nthe original pattern of radiation. Also known as an 'image plate', a\n'photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plate' can be used record a two-dimensional\nimage of the intensity short-wavelength (typically, X-ray) electromagnetic\nradiation. The device to read such a plate is known as a 'phosphorimager'\n(occasionally abbreviated to 'phosphoimager', perhaps reflecting its common\napplication in molecular biology of detecting radiolabeled phosphorylated\nproteins and nucleic acids).\n\nCreating an image requires illuminating the plate twice: the first exposure, to\nthe radiation of interest, \"writes\" the image, and a later, second illumination\n(typically by a visible-wavelength laser) \"reads\" the image.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Photostimulated_luminescence","recorded":1362481289,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["X-rays","Radiography"],"headings":["Basic Explanation","History","Uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Phosphor","Two-dimensional","Image","Electromagnetic_spectrum","X-ray","Electromagnetic_radiation","Molecular_biology","Radiolabel","Phosphorylated","Proteins","Nucleic_acids","Photographic_plate","Radiation","Laser","Phosphor","Crystal","Crystal_structure","Micrometers","Barium_fluorobromide","Europium","Divalent_cation","Solid_solution","Conduction_band","Metastable_state","Photomultiplier","Digital_image","Film","White_light","Fujifilm","Hospital","Computed_radiography","Crystallography","X-ray_image_intensifier","Radioluminescence","Spinthariscope","Fluoroscopy"]}
