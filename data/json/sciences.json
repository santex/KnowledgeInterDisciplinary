ISBN 0-19-511229-6. * <!----></ref>\nIn an older and closely related meaning, \"science\" also refers to a body of\nknowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably\napplied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist.\n\nSince classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely\nlinked to philosophy. In the early modern period the words \"science\" and\n\"philosophy\" were sometimes used interchangeably.<ref>David C. Lindberg (2007),\nThe beginnings of Western science: the European Scientific tradition in\nphilosophical, religious, and institutional context, Second ed. Chicago: Univ.\nof Chicago Press ISBN 978-0-226-48205-7, p.3</ref> By the 17th century, natural\nphilosophy (which is today called \"natural science\") was considered a separate\nbranch of philosophy.<ref>Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia\nMathematica (1687), for example, is translated \"Mathematical Principles of\nNatural Philosophy\", and reflects the then-current use of the words \"natural\nphilosophy\", akin to \"systematic study of nature\"</ref> However, \"science\"\ncontinued to be used in a broad sense denoting reliable knowledge about a topic,\nin the same way it is still used in modern terms such as library science or\npolitical science.\n\nIn modern use, \"science\" more often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not\nonly the knowledge itself. It is often treated as synonymous with 'natural and\nphysical science', and thus restricted to those branches of study that relate to\nthe phenomena of the material universe and their laws, sometimes with implied\nexclusion of pure mathematics. This is now the dominant sense in ordinary\nuse.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> This narrower sense of \"science\"\ndeveloped as scientists such as Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei and Isaac\nNewton began formulating [[laws of nature]] such as Newton's laws of motion. In\nthis period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as \"natural\nscience\". Over the course of the 19th century, the word \"science\" became\nincreasingly associated with the scientific method, a disciplined way to study\nthe natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology.\n\nIt is in the 19th century also that the term [[scientist]] was created by the\nnaturalist-theologian William Whewell to distinguish those who sought knowledge\non nature from those who sought knowledge on other disciplines. The Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary dates the origin of the word \"scientist\" to 1834. This\nsometimes left the study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo,\nwhich was resolved by classifying these areas of academic study as social\nscience. Similarly, several other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge\nexist today under the general rubric of \"science\", such as formal science and\napplied science.\n","title":"science","headings":["History and philosophy","Scientific practice","Scientific community","Science and society","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External
