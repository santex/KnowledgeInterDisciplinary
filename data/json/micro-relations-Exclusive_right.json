{"cursor":"3175","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In Anglo-Saxon law, an 'exclusive right' is a de facto, non-tangible prerogative\nexisting in law (that is, the power or, in a wider sense, right) to perform an\naction or acquire a benefit and to permit or deny others the right to perform\nthe same action or to acquire the same benefit. A \"prerogative\" is in effect an\nexclusive right. The term is restricted for use for official state or sovereign\n(i.e., constitutional) powers. Exclusive rights are a form of monopoly.\n\nExclusive rights can be established by law or by contractual obligation, but the\nscope of enforceability will depend upon the extent to which others are bound by\nthe instrument establishing the exclusive right; thus in the case of contractual\nrights, only persons that are parties to a contract will be affected by the\nexclusivity.\n\nExclusive rights may be granted in property law, copyright law, patent law, in\nrelation to public utilities, or, in some jurisdictions, in other [[sui\ngeneris]] legislation. Many scholars argue that such rights form the basis for\nthe concepts of property and ownership.\n\nPrivately granted rights, created by contract, may occasionally appear very\nsimilar to exclusive rights, but are only enforceable against the grantee, and\nnot the world at large.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Exclusive_right","recorded":1362535290,"links":17,"instances":["copyright_law","sociology","sociology","ownership_right"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Common law","Rights"],"headings":["Types of exclusive rights","History and arguments","Quotations","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","sociology"],["property","ownership_right"],["norm","sociology"],["moral_rights","copyright_law"]],"members":["moral_rights","norm","power","property"],"related":["Anglo-Saxon_law","Prerogative","Power_(sociology)","Right","Monopoly","Property_law","Copyright_law","Patent_law","Public_utility","Property_(ownership_right)","Ownership","Contract","Property","Real_property","Personal_property","Easement","Government","Bundle_of_Rights","Umbrella_term","Intellectual_property","Norm_(sociology)","Personal_property","Continental_Europe","Moral_rights_(copyright_law)","Natural_right","Personality_rights","Instrumentalism","Consequentialism","Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution"]}
