International Commission on Stratigraphy 2008:\n [http://www.stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart/Time%20Scale\n stratigraphy.org], retrieved 9 March 2009. Other subdivisions reflect the\n evolution of life; the Archean and Proterozoic are both eons, the Palaeozoic,\n Mesozoic and Cenozoic are eras of the Phanerozoic eon. The two million year\n Quaternary period, the time of recognizable humans, is too small to be visible\n at this scale.]]\n\nThe 'geologic time scale' is a system of chronological measurement that relates\nstratigraphy to time, and is used by geologists, paleontologists, and other\nearth scientists to describe the timing and relationships between events that\nhave occurred throughout Earth's history. The table of geologic time spans\npresented here agrees with the dates and nomenclature set forth by the\nInternational Commission on Stratigraphy, and uses the standard color codes of\nthe United States Geological Survey.\n\nEvidence from radiometric dating indicates that the Earth is about 4.54 billion\nyears old. The geology or [[deep time]] of Earth's past has been organized into\nvarious units according to events which took place in each period. Different\nspans of time on the GTS are usually delimited by changes in the composition of\nstrata which correspond to them, indicating major geological or paleontological\nevents, such as mass extinctions. For example, the boundary between the\nCretaceous period and the Paleogene period is defined by the\nCretaceousâPaleogene extinction event, which marked the demise of the dinosaurs\nand many other groups of life. Older time spans which predate the reliable\nfossil record (before the Proterozoic Eon) are defined by absolute age.\n\n__TOC__
