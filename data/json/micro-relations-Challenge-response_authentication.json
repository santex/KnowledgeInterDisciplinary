{"cursor":"8638","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn computer security, 'challengeâresponse authentication' is an authentication\nprocess that verifies an identity by requiring correct authentication\ninformation to be provided in response to a challenge. The authentication\ninformation is usually a value that is computed in response to an unpredictable\nchallenge value, but it might be just a password. \n\nAn adversary that can eavesdrop on a simple password authentication can then\nauthenticate itself in the same way using a replay attack. Most challenge-\nresponse authentication systems incorporate the feature that different\nchallenges can be issued and the prover must combine their credentials with the\nchallenge in some way in order to authenticate. An example would be to have\nmultiple passwords, each of them marked with an identifier. The verifier can\npick any of the identifiers, and the prover must respond with the correct\npassword for that identifier. Assuming that the passwords are chosen\nindependently, an adversary who intercepts one challengeâresponse pair cannot\nuse it to authenticate unless she is lucky enough to get the same challenge.\n\nAs a practical example, when other communications security methods are\nunavailable, the U.S. military uses the AKAC-1553 DRYAD numeral cipher to\nauthenticate and encrypt some communications. DRYAD includes a list of three-\nletter challenge codes, which the verifier is supposed to choose randomly from,\nand random three-letter responses to them. For added security, each set of codes\nis only valid for a particular time period which is ordinarily 24 hours.\n\nSoftware in the 1980s and 1990s often used a similar method for copy protection:\nchallenges would be questions like \"What is the second word in the third\nparagraph on page 418 of the manual?\". The security assumption was that copying\nthe manual was more difficult than copying the software disk.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Challenge-response_authentication","recorded":1362569683,"links":17,"instances":["algorithm","protocol","communications"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Password authentication","Computer access control protocols"],"headings":["Other non-cryptographic protocols","Cryptographic techniques","Simple example mutual-authentication sequence","Password storage","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["channel","communications"],["kerberos","protocol"],["rsa","algorithm"],["kerberos","protocol"]],"members":["rsa","kerberos","channel"],"related":["Computer_security","Replay_attack","Communications_security","United_States","AKAC-1553","DRYAD","Copy_protection","CAPTCHA","Turing_test","World_Wide_Web","Optical_character_recognition","Internet","Channel_(communications)","Shared_secret","In_the_clear","Eavesdropper","Encryption","Kerberos_(protocol)","Dictionary_attack","Brute-force_attack","Replay_attack","Cryptographic_nonce","Replay_attack","Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator","Cryptographic_hash_function","Mutual_authentication","Key_derivation_function","Unix","Password_salt","Algorithm","Zero-knowledge_password_proof","Secure_remote_password_protocol","CRAM-MD5","Secure_Shell","RSA_(algorithm)","Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol","CRAM-MD5","Cryptographic_hash_function","Cryptographic_nonce","Kerberos_(protocol)","Otway–Rees_protocol","Needham–Schroeder_protocol","Wide_Mouth_Frog_protocol","Password-authenticated_key_agreement","CAPTCHA","ReCAPTCHA","Distance-bounding_protocol","Reflection_attack","Replay_attack","Man-in-the-middle_attack","Physical_unclonable_function"]}
