The most common degrees\nawarded today are associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. Most\nhigher education institutions generally offer certificates and several programs\nleading to the obtainment of a Master of Advanced Studies, which is\npredominantly known as a DiplÃ´me d'Ã©tudes
