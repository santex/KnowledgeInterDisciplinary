Typical domestic uses of hot water include\ncooking, cleaning, bathing, and space heating. In industry, hot water and water\nheated to steam have many uses.\n\nDomestically, water is traditionally heated in vessels known as water heaters,\nkettles, cauldrons, pots, or coppers. These metal vessels that heat a batch of\nwater do not produce a continual supply of heated water at a preset temperature.\nRarely, hot water occurs naturally, usually from natural hot springs. The\ntemperature varies based on the consumption rate, becoming cooler as flow\nincreases.\n\nAppliances that provide a constant supply of hot water are variously called\nwater heaters, hot water heaters, [[hot water tank]]s, [[boiler]]s, [[heat\nexchanger]]s, geysers, or calorifiers, These names depend on region, and whether\nthey heat potable or non-potable water, are in domestic or industrial use, and\ntheir energy source. In domestic installations, potable water heated for uses\nother than space heating is also called domestic hot water (DHW).\n\nFossil fuels (natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, oil), or solid fuels are\ncommonly used for heating water. These may be consumed directly or may produce\nelectricity that, in turn, heats water. Electricity to heat water may also come\nfrom any other electrical source, such as nuclear power or renewable energy.\nAlternative energy such as solar energy, heat pumps, hot water heat recycling,\nand geothermal heating can also heat water, often in combination with backup\nsystems powered by fossil fuels or electricity.\n\nDensely-populated urban areas of some countries provide district heating of hot\nwater. This is especially the case in Scandinavia and Finland. District heating\nsystems supply energy for water heating and space heating from waste heat from\nindustries, power plants, incinerators, geothermal heating, and central solar\nheating. Actual heating of tap water is performed in heat exchangers at the\nconsumers' premises. Generally the consumer has no in-building backup system,\ndue to the expected high availability of district heating systems.\n","linknr":484,"url":"Water_heating","recorded":1362508733,"links":51,"instances":["window","insulation","architecture","physics","house"],"pdf":["https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/htgp_finalrule_fedreg.pdf","https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/htgp_finalrule_fedreg.pdf","http://copperalliance.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/06/technology_roadmap-en.pdf","http://www.iapmo.org/California%20Plumbing%20Code/Chapter%2005.pdf","http://www.iapmo.org/California%20Plumbing%20Code/Chapter%2005.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070922164043/http://www.ewgli.org/data/european_guidelines/european_guidelines_jan05.pdf","http://www.ewgli.org/data/european_guidelines/european_guidelines_jan05.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070922164043/http://www.ewgli.org/data/european_guidelines/european_guidelines_jan05.pdf"],"categories":["Boilers","Heating,
