{"cursor":"8355","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In geology, a 'redox buffer' is an assemblage of minerals or compounds that\nconstrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature. Knowledge of the redox\nconditions (or equivalently, oxygen fugacities) at which a rock forms and\nevolves can be important for interpreting the rock history. Iron, sulfur, and\nmanganese are three of the relatively abundant elements in the Earth's crust\nthat occur in more than one oxidation state. For instance, iron, the fourth most\nabundant element in the crust, exists as native iron, ferrous iron\n(Fe 2+ ), and ferric iron (Fe 3+ ). The redox state of a rock\naffects the relative proportions of the oxidation states of these elements and\nhence may determine both the minerals present and their compositions. If a rock\ncontains pure minerals that constitute a redox buffer, then the oxygen fugacity\nof equilibration is defined by one of the curves in the accompanying 'fugacity-\ntemperature diagram'. For other rocks with suitable minerals, oxygen fugacities\ncan be calculated, and the redox conditions can be obtained by comparison to the\nfugacity-temperature diagram.\n","linknr":167,"url":"Redox_buffer","recorded":1362486071,"links":11,"instances":["materials_science","mineralogy","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Igneous rocks","Petrology","Geochemistry"],"headings":["Common redox buffers and mineralogy","Minerals, rock types and characteristic buffers","Redox effects and sulfur","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Oxygen_Buffers.jpg/400px-Oxygen_Buffers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crust","geology"],["endmember","mineralogy"],["polymorphism","materials_science"]],"members":["polymorphism","endmember","crust"],"related":["Fugacity","Crust_(geology)","Magnetite","Hematite","Nickel","Fayalite","Magnetite","Quartz","Wustite","Magnetite","Iron","Wustite","Quartz","Iron","Fayalite","Silicate_minerals","Oxide","Hematite","Olivine","Bravais_lattice","Fayalite","Magnesium","Solid_solution","Titanium","Endmember_(mineralogy)","Ulvospinel","Igneous_rock","Fugacity","Wüstite","Magnetite","Fayalite","Magnetite","Quartz","Tectonic","Igneous_rock","Island_arc","Basalt","Gabbro","Sedimentary_depositional_environment","Magnetite","Hematite","Earth's_atmosphere","Shale","Metamorphism","Banded_iron_formation","Serpentinite","Meteorite","Iron","Wüstite","Sulfide","Pyrite","Pyrrhotite","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Marcasite","Coal","Shales","Acid_mine_drainage","Pinatubo","El_Chichon","Earth's_atmosphere","Magma","Calcium_sulfate","Anhydrite","Phenocryst","Tephra","Wüstite","Magnetite","Hematite","Pyrite","Pyrrhotite","Normative_mineralogy","Ellingham_diagram"]}
