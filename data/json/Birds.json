With around 10,000\nliving species, they are the most class of tetrapod vertebrates. All present\nspecies belong to the subclass Neornithes, and inhabit ecosystems across the\nglobe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Extant birds range in size from the Bee\nHummingbird to the Ostrich. The fossil record indicates that birds emerged\nwithin theropod dinosaurs during the Jurassic period, around Birds are the only\nmembers of the clade originating with the earliest dinosaurs to have survived\nthe CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event\n\nModern birds are characterised by feathers, a beak with no teeth, the laying of\nhard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a\nlightweight but strong skeleton. All living species of birds have wings; the\nmost recent species without wings was the moa, which is generally considered to\nhave become extinct in the 16th century. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most\nbird species can fly. Flightless birds include ratites, penguins, and a number\nof diverse endemic island species. Birds also have unique digestive and\nrespiratory systems that are highly adapted for flight. Some birds, especially\ncorvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent animal species; a number of\nbird species have been observed manufacturing and using tools, and many social\nspecies exhibit cultural transmission of knowledge across generations.\n\nMany species undertake long distance annual migrations, and many more perform\nshorter irregular movements. Birds are social; they communicate using visual\nsignals and through calls and songs, and participate in social behaviours,\nincluding cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators.\nThe vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one\nbreeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other\nspecies have polygynous (\"many females\") or, rarely, polyandrous (\"many males\")\nbreeding systems. Eggs are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents.\nMost birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.\n\nMany species are of economic importance, mostly as sources of food acquired\nthrough hunting or farming. Some species, particularly songbirds and parrots,\nare popular as pets. Other uses include the harvesting of guano (droppings) for\nuse as a fertiliser. Birds figure prominently in all aspects of human culture\nfrom religion to poetry to popular music. About 120â130 species have become\nextinct as a result of human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more\nbefore then. Currently about 1,200 species of birds are threatened with\nextinction by human activities, though efforts are underway to protect them.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Birds","recorded":1372152648,"links":[],"instances":["mythology","animal","bird","anatomy","bird","bird","mating_arena","family","biology","organism","biology","stage","anatomy","biology","plant","bird_activity","birds","biology","phylogenetics","biology","biology","feather","behavior","anatomy","bird","birds","journal","bird","metaphor","mythology","ornithology","biology","bird"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Birds|","Dinosaurs"],"headings":["Evolution
