Brittle materials absorb relatively little\nenergy prior to fracture, even those of high strength. Breaking is often\naccompanied by a snapping sound. Brittle materials include most ceramics and\nglasses (which do not deform plastically) and some polymers, such as PMMA and\npolystyrene. Many steels become brittle at low temperatures (see ductile-brittle\ntransition temperature), depending on their composition and processing.\n\nWhen used in materials science, it is generally applied to materials that fail\nwhen there is little or no evidence of plastic deformation before failure. One\nproof is to match the broken halves, which should fit exactly since no plastic\ndeformation has occurred.\n\nWhen a material has reached the limit of its strength, it usually has the option\nof either deformation or fracture. A naturally malleable metal can be made\nstronger by impeding the mechanisms of plastic deformation (reducing grain size,\nprecipitation hardening, work hardening, etc.), but if this is taken to an\nextreme, fracture becomes the more likely outcome, and the material can become\nbrittle. Improving material toughness is therefore a balancing act.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Brittle","recorded":1362481603,"links":34,"instances":["materials_science","physics","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Continuum mechanics","Materials science"],"headings":["Toughening","Effect of pressure","Crack growth","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Glass_fracture.jpg/200px-Glass_fracture.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Cast_iron_tensile_test.JPG/200px-Cast_iron_tensile_test.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Brittle_v_ductile_stress-strain_behaviour.png/200px-Brittle_v_ductile_stress-strain_behaviour.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","physics"],["strain","materials_science"],["plasticity","physics"],["stress","physics#residual_stress"],["crust","geology"]],"members":["stress","strain","plasticity","crust"],"related":["Material","Stress_(physics)","Strain_(materials_science)","Energy","Strength_of_materials","Ceramics","Glass","Polymer","Polymethyl_methacrylate","Polystyrene","Steel","Materials_science","Plasticity_(physics)","Malleable","Crystallite","Precipitation_hardening","Work_hardening","Toughness","Glass","Fracture_toughening_mechanisms","Laminated_glass","Polyvinyl_butyral","Viscoelastic","Toughened_glass","Pre-stressed_concrete","Prince_Rupert's_Drop","Polymers","High_impact_polystyrene","Silicon_carbide","Zirconia","Composite_materials","Glass_fibre","Polyester_resin","Metal_matrix_composite","Pressure","Brittle-ductile_transition_zone","Crust_(geology)","Ductility","Supersonic_fracture","Max_Planck_Institute_for_Metals_Research","Stuttgart","Markus_J._Buehler","Huajian_Gao","IBM_Almaden_Research_Center","San_Jose,_California","Farid_F._Abraham","Izod_impact_strength_test","Charpy_impact_test","Fractography","Forensic_engineering","Ductility","Strengthening_mechanisms_of_materials"]}
