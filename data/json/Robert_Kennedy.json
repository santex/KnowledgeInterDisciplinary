Prior to entering public office, he worked as a correspondent to\nthe [[Boston Post]] and as an attorney in Washington D.C.. He rose to national\nacclaim as the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Rackets Committee from 1957 to\n1959, where he publicly challenged Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa over the\ncorrupt practices of the union, and published The Enemy Within, a book about\ncorruption in organized labor.\n\nA prominent member of the Kennedy family, Bobby was the campaign manager for\nhis brother Jack in the 1960 presidential election and was appointed Attorney\nGeneral during his presidential administration. He also served as a White\nHouse adviser to the president from 1961 to 1963. His tenure is best known\nfor its advocacy for the African-American Civil Rights Movement, crusade\nagainst organized crime and the mafia, and diplomacy during the Berlin Crisis\nof 1961. After his brother's assassination, Kennedy left the LBJ\nadministration to run for the United States Senate in 1964, defeating\nRepublican incumbent Kenneth Keating.\n\nIn 1968, Kennedy campaigned for the presidency and was a leading Democratic\ncandidate, appealing particularly to black, Hispanic and Catholic voters.
