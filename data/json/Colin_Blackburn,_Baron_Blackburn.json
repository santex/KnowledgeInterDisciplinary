{"cursor":"5841","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn' (1813 â 8 January 1896) was a Scottish judge\nwho sat in the English courts, became a Law Lord and is remembered as one of the\ngreatest exponents of the common law.\n\nColin Blackburn was born at Killearn in Selkirkshire, one of the eight children\nof John Blackburn, a wealthy Glasgow sugar merchant, and his wife Rebecca\nGillies. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy, Eton and at Trinity College,\nCambridge, taking high mathematical honours in 1835. His younger\nbrother was the mathematician Hugh Blackburn.\n\nHe was called to the Bar in 1838, and went the northern circuit. His progress\nwas at first slow, and he employed himself in reporting and editing, with Thomas\nFlower Ellis, eight volumes of the highly-esteemed Ellis and Blackburn reports.\nHis deficiency in all the more brilliant qualities of the advocate almost\nconfined his practice to commercial cases, in which he obtained considerable\nemployment in his circuit; but he continued to belong to the outside bar, and\nwas so little known to the legal world that his promotion to a puisne judgeship\nin the Court of Queen's Bench in 1859 was at first ascribed to Lord Campbell's\npartiality for his fellow Scotsmen, but Lord Lyndhurst, Lord Wensleydale and\nLord Cranworth came forward to defend the appointment. Blackburn himself is said\nto have thought that a county court judgeship was about to be offered him, which\nhe had resolved to decline.\n\nHe soon proved himself one of the soundest lawyers on the bench, and when he was\npromoted to the Court of Appeal in 1876 was considered the highest authority on\ncommon law. In 1876 he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and a life peer as\n'Baron Blackburn', of Killearn in the County of Stirlingshire. Both in this\ncapacity and as judge of the Queen's Bench he delivered many judgments of the\nhighest importance, and no decisions have been received with greater\nrespect.

He died at his country\nresidence, Doonholm in Ayrshire, on 8 January 1896.\n\nThough greatly respected he does not seem to have been popular; according to a\nwell-known story he informed a colleague that he intended to retire in vacation\nto avoid the trouble of a retirement dinner â the colleague cheerfully replied\nthat this was quite unnecessary since no-one would have turned up to the dinner\nanyway.
