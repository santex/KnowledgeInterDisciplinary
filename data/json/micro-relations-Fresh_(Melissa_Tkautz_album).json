Melissa's debut single, \"Read My Lips\",\ncaused a storm with provocative lyrics such as \"if you want to wait till later\nthen hands off my detonator\".\n\n\"Read My Lips\" took 6 weeks to climb to number one - making it one of the\nfastest climbing Australian chart toppers of 1991. The single spent 2 weeks at\nnumber one, 11 weeks in the top 10 and 20 weeks in the top 50. Tkautz's debut\nsingle ended up as the 6th highest selling song in Australia for 1991 and in\nSouth Australia, where the local charts were heavily biased towards dance and\npop music, only Bryan Adams' mega worldwide smash \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for\nYou\" managed to outsell Melissa's \"Read My Lips\" in that year. Tkautz's next\nrelease, \"Sexy (Is The Word)\", took four weeks to peak at number 3, spending\nalmost two months in the top 10.\n\nHer third single, released in 1992, \"Skin To Skin\", peaked at number 16 and was\nreleased around the time Fresh was released which didn't perform well.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Fresh_(Melissa_Tkautz_album)","recorded":1362675547,"links":11,"instances":["melissa_song","melissa_tkautz_album","is_the_word"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Melissa Tkautz albums","1992 debut albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Singles","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/25/Melissa_Tkautz_-_Fresh_%28Album%29.jpg/220px-Melissa_Tkautz_-_Fresh_%28Album%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["read_my_lips","melissa_song"],["(everything_i_do_i_do_it_for_you"],["sexy","is_the_word"],["sexy","is_the_word"],["read_my_lips","melissa_song"],["lost_&_found","melissa_tkautz_album"]],"members":["read_my_lips","sexy"],"related":["Album","Melissa_Tkautz","Pop_music","Dance_music","Europop","Phantom_Records","Westside_Records","Melissa_Tkautz","Read_My_Lips_(Melissa_song)","Bryan_Adams","(Everything_I_Do)_I_Do_It_for_You","Sexy_(Is_The_Word)","Sexy_(Is_the_Word)","Skin_to_Skin","Read_My_Lips_(Melissa_song)","ARIA_Albums_Chart","Lost_&_Found_(Melissa_Tkautz_album)"]}
