(2005)]]\n\n'Signals intelligence' (often contracted to 'SIGINT') is intelligence-gathering\nby interception of signals, whether between people (\"communications\nintelligence\"âCOMINT), whether involving electronic signals not directly used in\ncommunication (\"electronic intelligence\"âELINT), or combinations of the two. As\nsensitive information is often encrypted, signals intelligence often involves\nthe use of cryptanalysis. Also, traffic analysisâthe study of who is signaling\nwhom and in what quantityâcan often produce valuable information, even when the\nmessages themselves cannot be decrypted.\n\nAs a means of collecting intelligence, signals intelligence is a subset of\nintelligence collection management, which, in turn, is a subset of intelligence\ncycle management.\n","linknr":1005,"url":"Signals_intelligence","recorded":1362902181,"links":57,"instances":["espionage","cryptography","israel","electronics","canadian_forces","waves","wwii","grammar"],"pdf":["http://www.trft.org/TRFTPix/spies9eR2006.pdf","http://www.trft.org/TRFTPix/spies9eR2006.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf","http://www.darpa.mil/DARPATech2000/Presentations/tto_pdf/6KesslerDDBB&WRev1.pdf","http://www.darpa.mil/DARPATech2000/Presentations/tto_pdf/6KesslerDDBB&WRev1.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070901131123/http://www.nor.com.au/community/sarc/acp124~1.pdf","http://www.nor.com.au/community/sarc/acp124~1.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070901131123/http://www.nor.com.au/community/sarc/acp124~1.pdf","http://fykse.dnsalias.com/radio/dok/german_sigint.pdf","http://www.tscmplus.com/sigintarchmsh.pdf"],"categories":["Signals
