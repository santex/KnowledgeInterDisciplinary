Microcephaly may be congenital or it may develop in the\nfirst few years of life. The disorder may stem from a wide variety of conditions\nthat cause abnormal growth of the brain, or from syndromes associated with\nchromosomal abnormalities. Two copies of a loss-of-function mutation in one of\nthe [[microcephalin]] genes causes primary microcephaly.\n\nIn general, life expectancy for individuals with microcephaly is reduced and the\nprognosis for normal brain function is poor. The prognosis varies depending on\nthe presence of associated abnormalities.\n","linknr":327,"url":"Microcephaly","recorded":1362511080,"links":34,"instances":["entertainer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Congenital disorders of nervous system"],"headings":["Causes","Presentation","Prognosis","History","Notable microcephalic persons","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Microcephaly.png/230px-Microcephaly.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["beetlejuice","entertainer"]],"members":["beetlejuice"],"related":["Neurodevelopmental_disorder","Standard_deviation","Cephalic_disorder","Autism","Macrocephaly","Schizophrenia","Alcoholism","Fetal_alcohol_syndrome","Herpes_simplex","Diabetes","Varicella_zoster_virus","Chickenpox","Rubella","German_measles","Cytomegalovirus","Cytomegalovirus","Radiation","Toxoplasmosis","Atomic_bombs","Hiroshima","Ground_zero","Gestation","In_utero","Relative_biological_effectiveness","Neutron","Little_Boy","Infant","Human_skull","Speech_communication","Quadriplegia","Freak_shows","Transitional_fossil","Zip_the_Pinhead","Schlitzie","Freaks","Comic_strip","Zippy_the_Pinhead","Bill_Griffith","Schlitzie","Beetlejuice_(entertainer)","The_Howard_Stern_Show","Wack_Pack","Zip_the_Pinhead","Freak_show","Triboulet","Jester","Louis_XII_of_France","Francis_I_of_France","France","Victor_Hugo","Giuseppe_Verdi","Hydrocephaly","Macrocephaly","Seckel_syndrome","Anencephaly","Greek_loanwords"]}
