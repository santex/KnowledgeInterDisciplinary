{"cursor":"14329","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In crystallography, 'water of crystallization' or 'water of hydration' or\n'crystallization water' is water that occurs in crystals. Water of\ncrystallization is necessary for the maintenance of crystalline properties, but\ncapable of being removed by sufficient heat.
