While the neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease\n(PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism, a wide-range of other etiologies\nmay lead to a similar set of symptoms, including some toxins, a few metabolic\ndiseases, and a handful of non-PD neurological conditions. {{cite journal\n | author = Christine CW, Aminoff MJ title = Clinical differentiation of\n | parkinsonian syndromes: prognostic and therapeutic relevance journal = Am.
