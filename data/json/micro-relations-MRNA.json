RNA is transcribed in the nucleus; processed, it is transported\nto the cytoplasm and translated by the ribosome. Finally, the mRNA is\ndegraded.]]\n\n'Messenger RNA' ('mRNA') is a large family of RNA molecules that convey genetic\ninformation from DNA to the ribosome, where they specify the amino acid sequence\nof the protein products of gene expression. Following transcription of mRNA by\nRNA polymerase, the mRNA is translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein,\nas summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nAs in DNA, mRNA genetic information is encoded in the sequence of nucleotides,\nwhich are arranged into codons consisting of three bases each. Each codon\nencodes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate\nprotein synthesis. This process of translation of codons into amino acids\nrequires two other types of RNA: Transfer RNA (tRNA), that mediates recognition\nof the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and ribosomal RNA\n(rRNA), that is the central component of the ribosome's protein-manufacturing\nmachinery.\n","linknr":541,"url":"MRNA","recorded":1362483951,"links":54,"instances":["biology","chemistry","biology","genetics","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.colorado.edu/mcdb/Lykke_Andersen/PDFs/Multiple_processingBody.pdf","http://www.colorado.edu/mcdb/Lykke_Andersen/PDFs/Multiple_processingBody.pdf"],"categories":["RNA","Gene expression","Protein biosynthesis","Genetics","Molecular genetics","Spliceosome","RNA splicing"],"headings":["Synthesis, processing, and function","Structure","Degradation","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/MRNA-interaction.png/300px-MRNA-interaction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/MRNA_structure.svg/700px-MRNA_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["base","chemistry"],["messenger_rna#poly(a_tail"],["soma","biology"],["translation","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["operator","biology"],["poly(a-binding_protein"],["poly(a-binding_protein"],["translation","genetics"],["poly(a-binding_protein"],["poly(a"],["v(dj_recombination"],["poly(a"]],"members":["operator","base","promoter","translation","transcription","soma"],"related":["Eukaryote","RNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Cell_nucleus","Cytoplasm","Translation_(genetics)","Ribosome","RNA","Genetic_information","DNA","Ribosome","Protein","Gene_expression","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase","Translation_(genetics)","Amino_acids","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Nucleotides","Codons","Base_(chemistry)","Amino_acid","Stop_codon","Protein_synthesis","Transfer_RNA","Ribosomal_RNA","Eukaryotes","Prokaryotes","RNA_polymerase","Eukaryote","Bacteria","Archea","7-methylguanosine","5'_end","Ribosome","RNase","RNA_polymerase","Enzyme","Catalyze","Biochemistry","Intron","Exon","Alternative_splicing","Spliceosome","RNA_editing","Apolipoprotein_B","Cell_nucleus","Cytoplasm","Nuclear_pore","Neuron","Soma_(biology)","Dendrite","ZBP1","Ribosome","Ribosomes","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Signal_recognition_particle","5'_UTR","Coding_region","3'_UTR","5'_end","Codons","Start_codon","Stop_codon","Pre-mRNA","Exonic_splicing_enhancer","Exonic_splicing_silencer","Five_prime_untranslated_region","Three_prime_untranslated_region","Exon","Translational_efficiency","Ribonuclease","MicroRNA","3'_UTR","Secondary_structure","SECIS_element","Riboswitch","Adenine","3'_end","Translation_(genetics)","Protein","Eukaryote","Open_reading_frame","Promoter_(biology)","Operator_(biology)","Bacteria","Archea","Proteins","EIF4E","Poly(A)-binding_protein","EIF4G","Poly(A)-binding_protein","Small_RNA","RNase_III","5'_cap","5'_end","RNase_J","Translation_(genetics)","Ribosome","Eukaryotic_initiation_factor","EIF-4E","EIF-4G","Poly(A)-binding_protein","DCP2","Exosome_complex","P-bodies","Polyadenylation","Cap_binding_complex","Exosome_complex","Decapping_complex","AU-rich_element","Poly(A)","Exosome_complex","Decapping_complex","AU-rich_element","C-Jun","C-Fos","Nonsense_mediated_decay","V(D)J_recombination","Adaptive_immune_system","Leaky_scanning","Frame_shift","Poly(A)","Endonuclease","Metazoan","Small_interfering_RNA","Dicer","RNA-induced_silencing_complex","Endonuclease","Exonuclease","Non-stop_decay","Piwi-interacting_RNA"]}
