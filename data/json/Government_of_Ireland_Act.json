The Act's long\ntitle was \"An Act to provide for the better government of Ireland\"; it is also\nknown as the 'Fourth Home Rule Bill' or (less accurately) as the 'Fourth Home\nRule Act'.\n\nThe Act was intended to establish separate Home Rule institutions within two new\nsubdivisions of Ireland: the six north-eastern counties were to form \"Northern\nIreland\", while the larger part of the country was to form \"Southern Ireland\".\nBoth areas of Ireland were to continue as a part of the United Kingdom, and\nprovision was made for their future unification under common Home Rule\ninstitutions.\n\nHome Rule never took effect in Southern Ireland due to the Irish War of\nIndependence, which resulted instead in the establishment in 1922 of the Irish\nFree State. The institutions set up under the Act for Northern Ireland\ncontinued until their suspension by the British parliament in 1972 as a\nconsequence of the Troubles.\n\nThe remaining provisions of the Act still in force in Northern Ireland were\nrepealed under the terms of the 1998 Belfast Agreement.\n","linknr":417,"url":"Government_of_Ireland_Act","recorded":1375080189,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland.svg/82px-Flag_of_the_Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland.svg.png","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Southern_Ireland","/wiki/Governor_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Ireland","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Act_1998","/wiki/File:Northern_and_Southern_Ireland.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Northern_and_Southern_Ireland.png/220px-Northern_and_Southern_Ireland.png","/wiki/File:Northern_and_Southern_Ireland.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Partition_of_Ireland","/wiki/Long_title","/wiki/Home_Rule","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Southern_Ireland","/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence","/wiki/Irish_Free_State","/wiki/Northern_Ireland_(Temporary_Provisions)_Act_1972","/wiki/The_Troubles","/wiki/Belfast_Agreement","#Background","#Long.27s_committee","#Developments_in_Ireland","#Two_.27Home_Rule.27_Irelands","#Structures_of_the_governmental_system","#Potential_for_Irish_unity","#Aftermath","#Northern_Ireland","#Southern_Ireland","#Consequences","#Repeal","#See_also","#Further_reading","#References_and_footnotes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule_movement","/wiki/File:David_Lloyd_George.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/David_Lloyd_George.jpg/100px-David_Lloyd_George.jpg","/wiki/File:David_Lloyd_George.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/British_Prime_Minister","/wiki/Devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Home_rule","/wiki/Irish_Government_Bill_1886","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)#The_Gladstonian_era","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Irish_Home_Rule_Bill_1893","/wiki/Veto","/wiki/House_of_Lords","/wiki/Third_Home_Rule_Act","/wiki/Irish_Parliamentary_Party","/wiki/Parliament_Act_1911","/wiki/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Conference","/wiki/Ulster","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Suspensory_Act_1914","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Home_Rule_Crisis","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919","/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles","/wiki/David_Lloyd_George","/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party","/wiki/Walter_Long,_1st_Viscount_Long","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Southern_Ireland","/wiki/Unicameral","/wiki/Bicameral","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Irish_Unionist_Alliance#Southern_Unionists","/wiki/Maurice_Dockrell_(1850%E2%80%931929)","/wiki/Joseph_Devlin","#cite_note-3","/wiki/First_D%C3%A1il","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Easter_Rising","/wiki/Conscription_Crisis_of_1918","/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1918","/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_(Ireland)","/wiki/Irish_Republic","/wiki/First_D%C3%A1il","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army","/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Southern_Ireland","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/County_Antrim","/wiki/County_Armagh","/wiki/County_Down","/wiki/County_Fermanagh","/wiki/County_Londonderry","/wiki/County_Tyrone","/wiki/Belfast","/wiki/Londonderry_(parliamentary_borough)","/wiki/Northern_Ireland","/wiki/Ulster","/wiki/Unionists_(Ireland)","/wiki/County_Fermanagh","/wiki/County_Tyrone","/w/index.php?title=Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Lord_Lieutenant_of_Ireland
