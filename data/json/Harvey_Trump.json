{"cursor":"2846","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Harvey Russell John Trump' (born Taunton Somerset on 11 October 1968) was an\nEnglish cricketer who played for Somerset between 1988 and 1996.\n\nTrump, the son of Gerald Trump, a former captain of both Somerset's Second XI\nand of Devon's Minor Counties side, was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a\nright-arm off-spin bowler. A successful school cricketer at Millfield\nSchool, he played for England's Under-19 team in Tests in Sri Lanka in 1986-87.\nIn these three matches, he took seven wickets and also scored an unbeaten 50 in\nthe final match at Galle.\n\nHe made his debut for Somerset in 1988 and played fairly regularly for nine\nseasons, without ever quite appearing to make the decisive breakthrough to be an\nautomatic selection.\n\nHis most successful seasons were 1991 and 1992: he took around 50 first-class\nwickets in each season and in 1992 against Gloucestershire in the last first-\nclass match played at the Wagon Works Ground at Gloucester he took seven for 52\nin each innings to give both his best innings and match figures.\n\nBut the following year Somerset recruited Mushtaq Ahmed as the county's overseas\nplayer and Trump's opportunities were more limited. Also, his batting never\ndeveloped, and he failed to reach 50 in first-class matches. He did not appear\nin first-class matches after 1996 and played only a few more List A games before\nretiring to become, like his father, a schoolteacher. He has since played a few\ntimes for Herefordshire in the Minor Counties.\n\nHarvey now teaches at Tettenhall College school in Wolverhampton.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Harvey_Trump","recorded":1375080511,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Taunton","/wiki/Somerset","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Gerald_Trump","/wiki/Devon_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Minor_Counties","/wiki/Off-spin","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Millfield_School","/wiki/Test_cricket","/wiki/Galle","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Wagon_Works_Ground","/wiki/Gloucester","/wiki/Mushtaq_Ahmed","/wiki/Herefordshire_County_Cricket_Club","/w/index.php?title=Tettenhall_College_school&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wolverhampton","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3862/3862.html","/wiki/CricketArchive","#cite_ref-2","http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/21601.html","/wiki/Cricinfo","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&action=edit&section=2","http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/21601.html","/wiki/ESPNcricinfo","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3862/3862.html","/wiki/CricketArchive","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&oldid=484289767","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1968_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Millfield","/wiki/Category:People_from_Taunton","/wiki/Category:English_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Somerset_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Marylebone_Cricket_Club_cricketers","/wiki/Category:Herefordshire_cricketers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Harvey+Trump&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Harvey+Trump","/wiki/Harvey_Trump","/wiki/Talk:Harvey_Trump","#","/wiki/Harvey_Trump","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Harvey_Trump","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Harvey_Trump","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&oldid=484289767","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5677633","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Harvey_Trump&id=484289767","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Harvey+Trump","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Harvey+Trump&oldid=484289767&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Harvey_Trump&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5677633#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Trump","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1968
