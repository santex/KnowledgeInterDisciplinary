{"cursor":"6847","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'endogenous viral element' (EVE) is a DNA sequence derived from a virus,\nand present within the germline of a non-viral organism. EVEs may be entire\nviral genomes (proviruses), or fragments of viral genomes. They arise when a\nviral DNA sequence becomes integrated into the genome of a germ cell that goes\non to produce a viable organism. The newly established EVE can be inherited\nfrom one generation to the next as an allele in the host species, and may even\nreach fixation.\n\nEndogenous retroviruses and other EVEs that occur as proviruses can potentially\nremain capable of producing infectious virus in their endogenous state.\nReplication of such 'active' endogenous viruses can lead to the proliferation of\nviral insertions in the germline. For most non-retroviral viruses, germline\nintegration appears to be a rare, anomalous event, and the resulting EVEs are\noften only fragments of the parent virus genome. Such fragments are usually not\ncapable of producing infectious virus, but may express protein or RNA.\n","linknr":182,"url":"Endogenous_viral_element","recorded":1362555543,"links":13,"instances":["evolution","population_genetics","human","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Virology"],"headings":["Diversity and distribution","Use in paleovirology","Co-option and exaptation by host species","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"],["host","biology"],["homology","biology#orthology"],["chromosome_7","human"],["lineage","evolution"]],"members":["lineage","homology","fixation","chromosome_7","host"],"related":["DNA","Virus","Germline","Provirus","Genome","Germ_cell","Heredity","Allele","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Endogenous_retrovirus","Infection","Protein","RNA","Animal","Plant","Fungus","Vertebrate","Retrovirus","Endogenous_retrovirus","Nuclear_genome","Host_(biology)","Viral_replication","Parvoviridae","Filoviridae","Bornavirus","Circoviridae","Cauliflower_mosaic_virus","Fossil","Paleovirology","Evolution","Genetic_divergence","Bornavirus","Lentivirus","Retrovirus","Molecular_clock","Deep_time","Selection","Simians","Viral_envelope","Exaptation","Placenta","Syncytiotrophoblast","Cytotrophoblast","Syncytium","ERVWE1","Endogenous_retrovirus","ERVWE1","Chromosome_7_(human)","Lineage_(evolution)","Primates","Rodent","Lagomorph","Carnivore","Ungulates","Paleovirology","Endogenous_retrovirus","Jaagsiekte_sheep_retrovirus","Mouse_mammary_tumor_virus","Murine_leukemia_virus","Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus","Koala_retrovirus","Avian_sarcoma_leukosis_virus","HERV-FRD","ERV3","Polydnavirus"]}
