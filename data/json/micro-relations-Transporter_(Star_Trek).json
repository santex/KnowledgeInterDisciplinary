Transporters convert a person or object into an energy pattern (a\nprocess called dematerialization), then \"beam\" it to a target, where it is\nreconverted into matter (rematerialization). The term transporter accident is a\ncatch-all term for when a person or object does not rematerialize correctly.\n\nAccording to The Making of Star Trek, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's\noriginal plan did not include transporters, instead calling for characters to\nland the starship itself. However, this would have required unfeasible and\nunaffordable sets and model filming, as well as episode running time spent while\nlanding, taking off, etc. The shuttlecraft was the next idea, but when filming\nbegan, the full-sized shooting model was not ready. Transporters were devised as\na less expensive alternative, achieved by a simple fade-out/fade-in of the\nsubject. Transporters first appear in the original pilot episode \"\". The\ntransporter special effect, before being done using computer animation, was\ncreated by turning a slow-motion camera upside down and photographing some\nbacklit shiny grains of aluminium powder that were dropped between the camera\nand a black background. Herbert F. Solow and Robert H. Justman, Inside Star\nTrek the real story, 1996, ISBN 0-671-00974-5.\n\nGene Roddenberry in 1964 had not seen [[The Fly (1958 film)|The Fly]] upon his\nfirst draft of \"The Cage\", but it was brought to his attention, and this is how\nthe transporter was considered. The later Dr Who series 'The Seeds of Death' in\n1969 also had teleport device called 'T-Mat' for a Teleport Matter transfer.\n\nAccording to the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]], the three\ntouch-sensitive light-up bars on the Enterprise-D's transporter console were an\nhomage to the three sliders used on the duotronic transporter console on the\noriginal Enterprise in The Original Series.\n\nIn August 2008, physicist Michio Kaku predicted in [[Discovery Channel\nMagazine]] that a teleportation device similar to those in Star Trek would be\ninvented within 100 years. Gary Sledge, Discovery Channel Magazine Issue 3,\nISSN 1793572-5.  However matter teleportation by disassembling molecules\nand putting them back together has been refuted as impossible by most physicts.\nThe only possible solution being force-field technology where the force field\nbubble containing an object or person is beamed, similar to those on the various\nStar Gate sagas.\n","linknr":481,"url":"Transporter_(Star_Trek)","recorded":1362668869,"links":30,"instances":["voyager_episode","star_trek","star_trek","star_trek","tng_episode","tng_episode","data","tng_episode","tng_episode","star_trek","enterprise_episode","tng_episode","ds9_episode","tng_episode","voyager_episode","filmmaking","tng_episode","philosophy","star_trek","tng_episode","star_trek","star_trek","tng_episode","star_trek"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Star Trek devices","Transport in fiction"],"headings":["Depiction","Scientific note","In popular culture","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c7/Transporter2.jpg/250px-Transporter2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Transporter3.jpg/220px-Transporter3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fade","filmmaking"],["daedalus","enterprise_episode"],["enterprise","nx-01"],["porthos","star_trek"],["uss_enterprise","ncc-1701"],["realm_of_fear","tng_episode"],["homefront","ds9_episode"],["encounter_at_farpoint","tng_episode"],["unnatural_selection","tng_episode"],["skin_of_evil","tng_episode"],["bloodlines","tng_episode"],["subspace","star_trek"],["dominion","star_trek"],["daedalus","enterprise_episode"],["the_most_toys","tng_episode"],["shades_of_gray","tng_episode"],["legacy","tng_episode"],["dark_frontier","voyager_episode"],["miles_o'brien","star_trek"],["shields","star_trek"],["the_wounded","tng_episode"],["caretaker","voyager_episode"],["vice_admiral","star_trek"],["lieutenant","star_trek"],["orders_of_magnitude","data"],["personal_identity","philosophy"],["replicator","star_trek"]],"members":["caretaker","vice_admiral","shields","unnatural_selection","encounter_at_farpoint","orders_of_magnitude","legacy","bloodlines","uss_enterprise","dominion","daedalus","shades_of_gray","homefront","realm_of_fear","enterprise","dark_frontier","fade","the_most_toys","personal_identity","lieutenant","the_wounded","subspace","replicator","skin_of_evil","porthos"],"related":["Star_Trek","Gene_Roddenberry","Teleportation","Star_Trek","Energy","Gene_Roddenberry","Fade_(filmmaking)","Computer-generated_imagery","Michio_Kaku","Daedalus_(Enterprise_episode)","Enterprise_(NX-01)","Jonathan_Archer","Porthos_(Star_Trek)","The_Andorian_Incident","Chosen_Realm","USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)","24th_century","Realm_of_Fear_(TNG_episode)","Homefront_(DS9_episode)","Starfleet_Academy","Benjamin_Sisko","Leonard_McCoy","Katherine_Pulaski","Encounter_at_Farpoint_(TNG_episode)","Unnatural_Selection_(TNG_episode)","Reginald_Barclay","Realm_of_Fear","Quantum_level","Heisenberg_uncertainty_principle","Michael_Okuda","Skin_of_Evil_(TNG_episode)","Bloodlines_(TNG_episode)","Subspace_(Star_Trek)","Dominion_(Star_Trek)","Daedalus_(Enterprise_episode)","Starfleet","The_Most_Toys_(TNG_episode)","Microbes","Viruses","Shades_of_Gray_(TNG_episode)","Photon_torpedo","Legacy_(TNG_episode)","Dark_Frontier_(Voyager_episode)","Captain's_Holiday","Geordi_LaForge","Starship_Enterprise","Starfleet","James_T._Kirk","Montgomery_Scott","James_T._Kirk","Realm_of_Fear","Geordi_La_Forge","Miles_O'Brien_(Star_Trek)","Tuvix","Tuvok","Neelix","Shields_(Star_Trek)","Technobabble","The_Wounded_(TNG_episode)","Trials_and_Tribble-ations","Caretaker_(Voyager_episode)","Vice_Admiral_(Star_Trek)","James_T._Kirk","Lieutenant_(Star_Trek)","Saavik","Antimatter","Dark_Frontier","One_of_Our_Planets_is_Missing","Day_of_the_Dove","And_the_Children_Shall_Lead","That_Which_Survives","The_Doomsday_Machine","Orders_of_magnitude_(data)","Human_being","Bekenstein_bound","Terabyte","Starship","Quantum_teleportation","Catchphrase","Beam_me_up,_Scotty","Montgomery_Scott","Personal_identity_(philosophy)","Physics_and_Star_Trek","Replicator_(Star_Trek)"]}
