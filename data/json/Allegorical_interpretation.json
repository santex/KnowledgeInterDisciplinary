{"cursor":"2331","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Allegorical interpretation' is an interpretive method which assumes that the\nBible has various levels of meaning and tends to focus on the spiritual sense\n(which comprises the allegorical sense, the moral (or tropological) sense, and\nthe anagogical sense) as opposed to the literal sense of scripture. It is\nsometimes referred to as the Quadriga, a reference to the Roman Quadriga, a\nchariot drawn by four horses.\n\nThe Quadriga is often explained through a Latin rhyme: ''Littera gesta docet,\nquid credas Allegoria, Moralis quid agas, quo tendas Anagogia.''\n\nIn English: The Literal teaches deeds, what you believe Allegory, Moral how you\nact, where you are going Anagogical.\n\nThe four methods of interpretation point in four different directions: The\nliteral/historical backwards to the past, the anagogic forwards to the future,\nthe tropological downwards to the moral/human, and the allegorical upwards to\nthe spiritual/heavenly.\n\nThe method has its origins in both Greek thought (which tried to avoid the\nliteral interpretations of ancient Greek myths) and in the rabbinical schools of\nthe Land of Israel. Most notably of pre-Christian authors Philo of Alexandria\nexpressly refers to its use by his predecessors and uses it himself to discover\nindications of different doctrines of philosophy in the stories of the\nPentateuch. The traces of allegorical and typological interpretation can be\nfound later in the New Testament but are further developed in the Epistle of\nBarnabas and especially by Origen.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, typology was the dominant Christian allegorical\ninterpretation, which developed sets of correspondences between the Old and New\nTestaments, believing that the events described in the Hebrew Bible or Old\nTestament had occurred in order to pre-figure events in the life of Christ in\nthe New; there were other classes of allegory in the Middle Ages.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Allegorical_interpretation","recorded":1362899422,"links":23,"instances":["theology","aesthetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biblical exegesis"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg/120px-Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg/32px-Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Star_of_David2.svg/30px-Star_of_David2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Ichthus.svg/40px-Ichthus.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["typology","theology"],["interpretation","aesthetics"]],"members":["typology","interpretation"],"related":["Bible","Tropological_reading","Anagoge","Quadriga","Greek_myths","Rabbinic_literature","Land_of_Israel","Philo_of_Alexandria","Typology_(theology)","New_Testament","Epistle_of_Barnabas","Origen","Middle_Ages","Hebrew_Bible","Allegory_in_the_Middle_Ages","Hermeneutics","Interpretation_(aesthetics)","Exegesis","Summary_of_Christian_eschatological_differences","Anagogical","Tropological"]}
