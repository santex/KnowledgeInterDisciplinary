A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one\nmoving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades\nattached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart\nrotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and\nwaterwheels.\n\nGas, steam, and water turbines usually have a casing around the blades that\ncontains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam\nturbine is given both to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854â1931),\nfor invention of the reaction turbine and to Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval\n(1845â1913), for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines\nfrequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying\nthe degree of reaction and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.\n\nThe word \"turbine\" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer Claude\nBurdin from the Latin turbo, or vortex, in a memoir, \"Des turbines\nhydrauliques ou machines rotatoires Ã  grande vitesse\", which he submitted to\nthe AcadÃ©mie royale des sciences in Paris. In 1822, Claude Burdin\nsubmitted his memoir \"Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires Ã \ngrande vitesse\" (Hydraulic turbines or high-speed rotary machines) to the\nAcadÃ©mie royale des sciences in Paris. (See: Annales de chimie et de physique,\nvol. 21,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=rzNCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q&f=false\npage 183] (1822).) However, it was not until 1824 that a committee of the\nAcadÃ©mie (composed of Prony, Dupin, and Girard) reported favorably on Burdin's\nmemoir. See: Prony and Girard (1824) [http://books.google.com/books?id=03BRAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-\nPA207#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Rappport sur le mÃ©moire de M.
