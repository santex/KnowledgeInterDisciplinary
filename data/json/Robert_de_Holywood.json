{"cursor":"2372","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Robert de Holywood' (died 1384) was an Irish judge and landowner who held the\noffice of Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer: he was the ancestor of the\nHollywood family of Artane Castle.\n\nHe took his surname from the parish of Holywood, near Balbriggan, County\nDublin. Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray\nLondon 1926 Vol.1 p.84 He was a Remembrancer of the Court of Exchequer\n(Ireland) in 1356 and in 1359 was charged with the defence of Leinster. He was\nappointed Chief Baron in 1363, superseded the following year, reappointed in\n1367. In 1376 he finally stepped down as Chief Baron. Ball\np.84\n\nIn 1361 he was pardoned for purchasing land without royal permission. This may\nrefer to his purchase of Artane Castle, of which he was the first recorded owner\nand which remained in his family for several centuries (unlike most judges of\nthe time he was a layman ). Adams, C.L. Castles of Ireland London 1904\np.18 In 1367 he sat on a powerful commission to determine whether the\nmanor of Rathkeale was Crown land, but it apparently never reported, since an\nidentical inquiry was launched in 1374. Ball notes that while many of his fellow\njudges exposed themselves to danger on assize, Holywood preferred the security\nof Dublin. Ball p.34 In 1373, in consideration of his\ngood services to the Crown, he was given permission to found a chantry with five\nchaplains at Holywood and in 1376 was given licence to allow them to choose a\nwarden. The chaplains were required to pray for the souls\nof Sir Robert himself, his two wives and Queen Philippa of Hainault late wife of\nKing Edward III. Patent Rolls of Edward III vol.xv. p.338\n\nHis first wife was named Joan; his second, living in 1376, was called Nesta. He died in 1384.\n","linknr":110,"url":"Robert_de_Holywood","recorded":1375066019,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Chief_Baron_of_the_Irish_Exchequer","/wiki/Balbriggan","/wiki/County_Dublin","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Remembrancer","/wiki/Court_of_Exchequer_(Ireland)","/wiki/Leinster","#cite_note-Ball-p84-2","/wiki/Artane,_Dublin","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Rathkeale","/wiki/Assize","/wiki/Dublin","#cite_note-Ball-p34-4","/wiki/Chantry","#cite_note-Ball-p84-2","/wiki/Philippa_of_Hainault","/wiki/Edward_III","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-Ball-p34-4","/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-Ball-p84_2-0","#cite_ref-Ball-p84_2-1","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-Ball-p34_4-0","#cite_ref-Ball-p34_4-1","#cite_ref-5","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Shamrock.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Shamrock.svg/23px-Shamrock.svg.png","/wiki/Irish_people","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Ireland-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Ireland-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Ireland-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&oldid=564280632","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Irish_judges","/wiki/Category:1384_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_County_Dublin","/wiki/Category:Irish_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+de+Holywood&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Robert+de+Holywood","/wiki/Robert_de_Holywood","/wiki/Talk:Robert_de_Holywood","#","/wiki/Robert_de_Holywood","/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Robert_de_Holywood","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Robert_de_Holywood","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&oldid=564280632","/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7351408","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Robert_de_Holywood&id=564280632","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Robert+de+Holywood","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Robert+de+Holywood&oldid=564280632&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Robert_de_Holywood&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7351408#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_de_Holywood","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["ireland"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Irish
