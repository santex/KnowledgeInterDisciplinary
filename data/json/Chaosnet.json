{"cursor":"6583","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Chaosnet' was first developed by Thomas Knight and Jack\nHolloway at MIT's AI Lab in 1975 and thereafter. It refers to two separate, but\nclosely related, technologies. The more widespread was a set of\ncomputer communication packet-based protocols intended to connect the then-\nrecently developed and very popular (within MIT) Lisp machines; the second was\none of the earliest local area network hardware implementations.\n\nThe Chaosnet protocol originally used the latter, an implementation over CATV\ncoaxial cable modeled on the early Xerox PARC Ethernet, the early\nARPANET, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It was a contention-based\nsystem intended to work over a range, that included a pseudo-slotted\nfeature intended to reduce collisions, which worked by passing a virtual token\nof permission from host to host; successful packet transmissions updated each\nhost's knowledge of which host had the token at that time. Collisions caused a\nhost to fall silent for a duration depending on the distance from the host it\ncollided with. Collisions were never a real problem, and the pseudo-\nslotting fell into disuse.\n\nChaosnet's network topology was usually series of linear (not circular) cables,\neach up to a maximum of a kilometer and roughly 12 clients. The individual\nsegments were interconnected by \"bridges\" (much in the ARPANET mold), generally\nolder computers like PDP-11s with two network interfaces.\n\nThe protocols were also later implemented as a payload that could be carried\nover Ethernet (usually the later variety). Chaosnet was specifically for LANs;\nfeatures to support WANs were left out for the sake of simplicity.\n\nChaosnet can be regarded as a contemporary of both the PUP protocols invented by\nPARC, and the Internet Protocol, and was recognized as one of the other network\nclasses (other than \"IN\") in the Domain Name System. BIND uses a built-\nin pseudo-top-level-domain in the \"CHAOS class\" for retrieving information about\na running DNS\nserver.[http://www.bind9.net/manual/bind/9.3.2/Bv9ARM.ch06.html#builtin]\n\nThe Chaosnet protocol identifies hosts by 16-bit addresses, 8 bits of which\nidentify the subnet, 8 bits of which identify the host within the\nsubnet. The basic protocol was a full-duplex reliable packet\ntransmission between two user processes. The packet contents could be treated as\nbytes of 8 or 16 bits, with support for other word sizes provided by higher-\nlevel protocols. The connection was identified by a combination of the 16-bit\naddresses of each host and a 16-bit \"connection index\" assigned by each host to\nmaintain uniqueness. \"Controlled\" packets within a connection were identified by\na 16-bit packet number, which was used to deliver controlled packets reliably\nand in order, with re-transmission and flow control. \"Uncontrolled\" packets were\nnot retransmitted, and were used at a lower level to support the flow-control\nand re-transmission. Chaosnet also supported \"BRD\" broadcast packets to multiple\nsubnets.\n\nInitial establishment of the connection was made using \"contact names.\" These\nnames identified the network service and higher-level protocol. For example\n\"STATUS\" was the contact name which requested basic network statistics from a\nhost. \"TELNET\" was a contact name for the Arpanet TELNET protocol. \"FILE\" was a\ncontact name for the Lisp Machine network file service. Other contact names\nincluded \"SUPDUP\", \"MAIL\", \"NAME\" for the Arpanet Finger protocol, \"TIME\",\n\"SEND\" for interactive messaging, \"ARPA\" for a gateway service to Arpanet.\n\"DOVER\" was the contact name for sending print jobs to Chaosnet hosts with a\nXerox Dover printer attached. Developers could easily experiment\nwith new protocols by inventing new contact names. In ITS, a new server for\nthat protocol could be installed by creating a link to the program in the\nlocation DSK:DEVICE;CHAOS  where  was up to six letters of the\ncontact name.\n\nSimple transactions could be completed by a single \"RFC\" packet containing a\ncontact name, answered by a single \"ANS\" packet with the relevant information.\nFor example, an RFC to contact name \"TIME\" would result in a single ANS packet\ncontaining a 32-bit number indicating the time.\n\nThe original GNU Manifesto mentioned that it aimed to, among other things,\nsupport the Chaosnet protocol.\n\nSymbolics, a maker of the Lisp machines, licensed the MIT Chaosnet hardware and\nsoftware implementation from the CADR computer design.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Chaosnet","recorded":1374541450,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Tom_Knight_(scientist)","/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","/wiki/MIT_AI_Lab","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Computer","/wiki/Protocol_(computing)","/wiki/Lisp_machine","/wiki/Local_area_network","/wiki/CATV","/wiki/Xerox_PARC","/wiki/Ethernet","#cite_note-2","/wiki/ARPANET","/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/PDP-11","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Wide_area_network","#cite_note-6","/wiki/PARC_Universal_Packet","/wiki/Internet_Protocol","/wiki/Domain_Name_System","#cite_note-7","/wiki/BIND","http://www.bind9.net/manual/bind/9.3.2/Bv9ARM.ch06.html#builtin","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Incompatible_Timesharing_System","#cite_note-11","/wiki/GNU_Manifesto","/wiki/Symbolics","/wiki/Lisp_machine","/wiki/MIT","/wiki/Lisp_machine","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-2","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-3","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-4","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-5","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-6","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-7","/wiki/Paul_Mockapetris","https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.6","/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.6","#cite_ref-8","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-9","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-10","#CITEREFMoon","#cite_ref-11","#CITEREFMoon","/wiki/David_Moon","https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6353","http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6353","https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6353","http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/its/sysdoc.tar.gz","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&action=edit&section=2","http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ssr83/rpc_r/48381.htm","http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/net/0104.3/0050.html","http://gopher.quux.org:70/Archives/usenet-a-news/FA.works/81.07.13_ucbvax.2264_fa.works.txt","http://web.archive.org/web/20070930201300/http://bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/AIM-628_chaosnet.pdf","ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/500-999","http://chaosnet.sourceforge.net/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&oldid=565081611","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Local_area_networks","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chaosnet&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Chaosnet","/wiki/Chaosnet","/wiki/Talk:Chaosnet","#","/wiki/Chaosnet","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Chaosnet","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chaosnet","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&oldid=565081611","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4356555","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Chaosnet&id=565081611","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Chaosnet","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Chaosnet&oldid=565081611&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Chaosnet&printable=yes","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAOSnet","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaosnet","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4356555#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy",
