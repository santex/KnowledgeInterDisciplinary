{"cursor":"4633","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" 2a and 2b on surface.]] 'Serotype' or 'serovar' refers to distinct variations\n within a species of bacteria or viruses or among immune cells of different\n individuals. These microorganisms, viruses, or cells are classified together\n based on their cell surface antigens, allowing the epidemiologic classification\n of organisms to the sub-species level. \"serovar.\" The American Heritage Medical Dictionary.\n 2007. Houghton Mifflin Company 24 Oct. 2009 http://medical-\n dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/serovar A group of serovars with common\n antigens is called a 'serogroup'.\n\nSerotyping often plays an essential role in determining species and subspecies.\nThe [[Salmonella]] genus of bacteria, for example, has been determined to have\nover 4400 serotypes, including [[Salmonella enterica]] serovar Typhimurium, S.\nenterica serovar Typhi, and S. enterica serovar Dublin.\n[[Vibrio cholerae]], the species of bacteria that causes cholera, has over 200\nserotypes, based on cell antigens. Only two of them have been observed to\nproduce the potent enterotoxin that results in cholera: 0:1 and 0:139.\n\nSerotypes were discovered by the American microbiologist Rebecca Lancefield in\n1933.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Serotype","recorded":1362554070,"links":35,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Serology","Speciation","Scientific classification","Taxonomy","Microbiology"],"headings":["Role in organ transplantation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Serotypes_%E2%80%93_Antibody_versus_antigen.svg/300px-Serotypes_%E2%80%93_Antibody_versus_antigen.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Anti-HLA_agglutinated_RBC.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Microorganisms","Virus","Cell_(biology)","Antigen","Genus","Bacteria","Species","Cholera","Rebecca_Lancefield","Red_blood_cell","Antisera","IgM","Immune_system","Human_leukocyte_antigen","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Hemagglutination","Transplant_rejection","Biovar","Morphovar"]}
