Hypoderm and\nsubcutaneous are from Greek and Latin words, respectively, for \"beneath the\nskin.\" Mosbyâs Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth\nEdition, Mosby-Year Book 1994, pp. 998, 774, 1497 Types of cells that are\nfound in the hypodermis are fibroblasts, adipose cells, and macrophages. It is\nderived from the mesoderm, but unlike the dermis, it is not derived from the\ndermatome region of the mesoderm. In arthropods, the hypodermis is an epidermal\nlayer of cells that secretes the chitinous cuticle. The term also refers to a\nlayer of cells lying immediately below the epidermis of plants.\n\nThe hypodermis is used mainly for fat storage.\n\nA layer of tissue lies immediately below the dermis of vertebrate skin. It is\noften referred to as subcutaneous tissue though this is a less precise and\nanatomically inaccurate term. The hypodermis consists primarily of loose\nconnective tissue and lobules of fat. It contains larger blood vessels and\nnerves than those found in the dermis.\n","linknr":247,"url":"Subcutaneous_fat","recorded":1362485127,"links":32,"instances":["anatomy","skin"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Skin anatomy"],"headings":["Contents","Injection","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Skin.png/250px-Skin.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Gray188.png/32px-Gray188.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dermatome","anatomy"],["epidermis","botany"],["epidermis","skin"]],"members":["dermatome","epidermis"],"related":["Terminologia_Histologica","Integumentary_system","Vertebrate","Fibroblast","Adipose_cells","Macrophage","Dermis","Dermatome_(anatomy)","Chitin","Cuticle","Epidermis_(botany)","Adipose_tissue_","Cutaneous_nerve","Panniculus_carnosus","Caenorhabditis_elegans","Panniculus_adiposus","Visceral_fat","Peritoneal_cavity","Body_fat","Caliper","Adiposity","Homeostasis","Route_of_administration","Insulin","Skin_popping","Recreational_drugs","Epidermis_(skin)","Dermis"]}
