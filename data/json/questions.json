The information requested may be\nprovided in the form of an answer.\n\nQuestions have developed a range of uses that go beyond the simple eliciting of\ninformation from another party. Rhetorical questions, for example, are used to\nmake a point, and are not expected to be answered. Many languages have special\ngrammatical forms for questions (for example, in the English sentence \"Are you\nhappy?\", the inversion of the subject you and the verb are shows it to be a\nquestion rather than a statement). However questions can also be asked without\nusing these interrogative grammatical structures – for example one may use an\nimperative, as in \"Tell me your name\".\n\nFor detailed information about the grammar of question formation, see\nInterrogative, and for English specifically, .\n","title":"Question","headings":["Uses","Types","Grammar","Responses","Learning","Philosophical questions","Origins of questioning behavior","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["3: Rhetorical_question","3: Yes_and_no","3: Interrogative_word","2: Answer","2: Interrogative","2: Socratic_method","2: Five_Ws","2: Yesâno_question","2: Question_mark","1: Information","1: Grammar","1: Imperative_mood","1: Quiz","1: Examination","1: Research","1: Loaded_question","1: Leo_Tolstoy","1: Closed-ended_question","1: Multiple_choice","1: Open-ended_question","1: Job_interview","1: Bloom's_Taxonomy","1: Wh-movement","1: Tag_question","1: Indirect_question","1: Subordinate_clause","1: Grammatical_tense","1: Indirect_speech","1: Syntax","1: Declarative_sentence","1: English_grammar","1: German_grammar","1: French_grammar","1: Word_order","1: Verb","1: Special_verb","1: Do-support","1: Interrogative_particle","1: Japanese_language","1: Standard_Mandarin","1: Polish_grammar","1: Wh-fronting","1: Declarative_question","1: Latin_alphabet","1: Cyrillic_script","1: Spanish_language","1: Â¿","1: Pragmatics","1: French_language","1: German_language","1: Danish_language","1: Norwegian_language","1: Answer_ellipsis","1: Scientific_method","1: Inquiry_education","1: Exam","1: Philosophy","1: Concept","1: Euthanasia","1: MÄori_people","1: Pakeha","1: Theory","1: Joseph_Jordania","1: Kanzi","1: Washoe","1: David_Premack","1: Syntactic_structure","1: Jordania","1: Language_development","1: Debate","1: Doubt","1: Exclamation","1: Inquiry","1: Interrobang","1: Interrogation","1: Interrogatory","1: Leading_question","1: Logic","1: Problem","1: Proposition","1: Sentence_function","1: Truth","1: Twenty_Questions","1: Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy"]}
