It is an odorless dark-brown\n crystalline powder which is nearly insoluble in water. It exists in two\n crystalline forms. The alpha phase has orthorhombic symmetry; it has been first\n synthesized in 1941 and identified in nature as a rare mineral scrutinyite in\n 1988. On the contrary, the more prevailing, tetragonal beta phase was first\n identified as the mineral plattnerite around 1845 and later produced\n synthetically. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent which is used in the\n manufacture of matches, pyrotechnics, dyes and other chemicals. It also has\n several important applications in electrochemistry, in particular as a\n component of lead acid batteries.\n","linknr":313,"url":"Lead_dioxide","recorded":1362562466,"links":39,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://rruff.info/uploads/HBM1845_500.pdf","http://rruff.info/uploads/CM26_905.pdf","http://rruff.info/uploads/CM26_905.pdf"],"categories":["Oxides","Lead compounds","Acidic oxides","Plumbates","Pyrotechnic oxidizers"],"headings":["Properties","Production","Applications","Safety","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Lead_dioxide.jpg/200px-Lead_dioxide.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Oxid_olovi%C4%8Dit%C3%BD.PNG/100px-Oxid_olovi%C4%8Dit%C3%BD.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/7px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/NFPA_704.svg/75px-NFPA_704.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/14px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fb/Yes_check.svg/10px-Yes_check.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/X_mark.svg/10px-X_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/ScrutinyiteStructure.png/120px-ScrutinyiteStructure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/PlattneriteStructure.png/120px-PlattneriteStructure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lead(ii_oxide"],["thallium(iii_oxide"],["bismuth(iii_oxide"],["lead(ii_nitrate"]],"members":[],"related":["Plattnerite","Acetic_acid","Alcohol","Carbon_dioxide","Silicon_dioxide","Germanium_dioxide","Tin_dioxide","Lead(II)_oxide","Lead_tetroxide","Lead","Oxide","Thallium(III)_oxide","Bismuth(III)_oxide","Oxide","Lead","Oxidation_state","Orthorhombic","Scrutinyite","Tetragonal","Plattnerite","Electrochemistry","Lead_acid_battery","Scrutinyite","Plattnerite","Orthorhombic","Space_group","Pearson_symbol","Tetragonal","Space_group","Pearson_symbol","Amphoteric","Plumbate","Electrolyte","Anode","Cathode","Calcium_chloride","Electrochemistry","Sulfuric_acid","Copper","Galvanostat","Mohs_hardness","Titanium","Niobium","Tantalum","Graphite","Lead(II)_nitrate","Abrasive_blasting","Match","Sulfide","Polymer","Lightning_arrester","Overvoltage","Hydrochloric_acid","Potassium_dichromate","Electroplating","Glyoxylic_acid","Oxalic_acid","Lead_acid_battery","Lead_acid","Sulfuric_acid"]}
