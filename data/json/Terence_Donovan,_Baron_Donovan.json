He was elected as Member of Parliament for Leicester\nEast. When that constituency was abolished for the 1950 general election, he was\nre-elected for the new Leicester North East constituency.\n\nHowever, Donovan resigned from the House of Commons within weeks of the\nelection, when he was appointed as a High Court judge (his successor, Sir Lynn\nUngoed-Thomas, also became a judge, in 1962). He was promoted to the Appeals\nCourt in 1960, when he also became a Privy Counsellor. In 1964 he was appointed\nas a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, remaining in post until 1971. As a Law lord he\nwas given a life peerage as Baron Donovan, of Winchester in the County of\nHampshire. He died within the City of London aged 73.\n\nThe Hon.
