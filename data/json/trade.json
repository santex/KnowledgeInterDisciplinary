Trade is\nsometimes loosely called commerce or financial transaction or barter. A network\nthat allows trade is called a market. The original form of trade was barter, the\ndirect exchange of goods and services. Later one side of the barter were the\nmetals, precious metals (poles, coins), bill, paper money. Modern traders\ninstead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a\nresult, 'buying' can be separated from 'selling', or earning. The invention of\nmoney (and later credit, paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified\nand promoted trade. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while\ntrade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade.\n\nTrade exists for man due to specialization and division of labor, in which most\npeople concentrate on a small aspect of production, trading for other products.\nTrade exists between regions because different regions have a comparative\nadvantage in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different\nregions size allows for the benefits of mass production. As such, trade at\nmarket prices between locations benefits both locations.\n\nRetail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed\nlocation, such as a department store, boutique or kiosk, or by mail, in small or\nindividual lots for direct consumption by the purchaser.\nWholesale trade is defined as the sale of goods or merchandise to retailers, to\nindustrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or\nto other wholesalers and related subordinated\nservices.

financial markets.\n","linknr":850,"url":"trade","recorded":1362574641,"links":118,"instances":["historiography","business_writer","economics","finance","travellers","ancient_greece","international_relations","mythology","economics","economics","functional","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Trade|"],"headings":["History
