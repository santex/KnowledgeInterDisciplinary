in Guadalajara, Jalisco.]]\n\n'Trade' also called goods exchange economy is the transfer of ownership of goods\nfrom one person or entity to another by getting something in exchange from the\nbuyer. Trade is sometimes loosely called commerce or financial transaction or\nbarter. A network that allows trade is called a market. The original form of\ntrade was barter, the direct exchange of goods and services. Later one side of\nthe barter were the metals, precious metals (poles, coins), bill, paper money.\nModern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as\nmoney. As a result, 'buying' can be separated from 'selling', or earning. The\ninvention of money (and later credit, paper money and non-physical money)\ngreatly simplified and promoted trade. Trade between two traders is called\nbilateral trade, while trade between more than two traders is called\nmultilateral trade.\n\nTrade exists for man due to specialization and division of labor, in which most\npeople concentrate on a small aspect of production, trading for other products.\nTrade exists between regions because different regions have a comparative\nadvantage in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different\nregions size allows for the benefits of mass production. As such, trade at\nmarket prices between locations benefits both locations.\n\nRetail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed\nlocation, such as a department store, boutique or kiosk, or by mail, in small or\nindividual lots for direct consumption by the purchaser.<ref name=\"fas\"></ref>\nWholesale trade is defined as the sale of goods or merchandise to retailers, to\nindustrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or\nto other wholesalers and related subordinated\nservices.<ref>[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/completeacc_e.htm#chn\nWTO â€“ World Trade Organization]</ref>\n\nTrading can also refer to the action performed by traders and other market\nagents in the financial markets.\n","title":"trade","headings":["History","Perspectives","Current trends","International trade","Notes","Bibliography"]},"micro-relation":["2: Comparative_advantage","2: Hanseatic_League","1: Guadalajara,_Jalisco","1: Ownership","1: Buyer","1: Commerce","1: Financial_transaction","1: Market","1: Money","1: Earnings","1: Commodity","1: Mass_production","1: Market_price","1: Retail","1: Sales","1: Department_store","1: Boutique","1: Kiosk","1: Mail","1: Wholesale","1: Merchandise","1: Retailer","1: Business","1: Financial_markets","1: History_of_communication","1: Prehistoric","1: History_of_international_trade","1: Circa","1: Flint","1: Stone_age","1: New_Guinea","1: Robert_Carr_Bosanquet","1: James_Silk_Buckingham","1: John_Sterling","1: Frederick_Denison_Maurice","1: Henry_Stebbing","1: Charles_Wentworth_Dilke","1: Thomas_Kibble_Hervey","1: William_Hepworth_Dixon","1: Norman_Maccoll","1: Vernon_Horace_Rendall","1: John_Middleton_Murry","1: W._Lewer","1: Chert","1: Douglas_Harper","1: Melos","1: Lipari","1: Sar-i_Sang","1: Kassites","1: Ebla","1: Bamber_Gascoigne","1: Jewelry","1: Egypt","1: 3rd_millennium_BC","1: Sumerians","1: Mesopotamia","1: Indus_Valley_Civilization","1: Indus_River","1: Phoenicians","1: Mediterranean_Sea","1: Prehistoric_Britain","1: Tin","1: Bronze","1: Greece","1: Civilization","1: Roman_empire","1: Spice","1: India","1: China","1: Roman_commerce","1: Piracy","1: Hermes","1: Alexander_S._Murray","1: Johannes_Hasebroek","1: Western_Europe","1: Radhanite","1: Jew","1: Christian","1: Europe","1: Muslim","1: Near_East","1: Late_Middle_Ages","1: Sogdiana","1: Silk_Road","1: Suyab","1: Taraz","1: Central_Asia","1: Viking","1: Varangians","1: Scandinavia","1: Russia","1: Monopoly","1: Northern_Europe","1: Baltic_region","1: Vasco_da_Gama","1: Spice_trade","1: History_of_Kozhikode","1: Cape_of_Good_Hope","1: Age_of_Discovery","1: Gold","1: Seventeen_Provinces","1: Exchange_control","1: East_Indies","1: Portugal","1: Dutch_Republic","1: United_Kingdom","1: Spanish_Empire","1: Atlantic_Ocean","1: Pacific_Ocean","1: Adam_Smith","1: Mercantilism","1: Economic","1: Division_of_labour","1: Productive","1: International_trade","1: Export","1: Dutch_East_India_Company","1: Bankrupt","1: Timbuktu","1: David_Ricardo","1: James_Mill","1: Robert_Torrens","1: Principles_of_Political_Economy_and_Taxation","1: Economics","1: John_Stuart_Mill","1: Pricing_power","1: Terms_of_trade","1: Tariff","1: Economic_surplus","1: Infant_industry","1: Protectionism","1: Industrialize","1: England","1: Great_Depression","1: World_War_II","1: International_political_economy","1: General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade","1: BBC","1: European_Union","1: North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement","1: Marrakech_Agreement","1: World_Trade_Organization","1: Free_trade","1: Most_favoured_nation","1: Central_American_Free_Trade_Agreement","1: Tariffs","1: Import_quota","1: Great_depression","1: Judeo-Christian","1: Denarius","1: Commodity_money","1: Iraq","1: Mexico","1: Montezuma","1: Currency","1: Numismatist","1: Precious_metal","1: Coins","1: Trade_barrier","1: Fair_trade","1: Developing_countries","1: Developed_countries","1: G20","1: Agricultural_subsidies","1: Trade_facilitation","1: Doha","1: Qatar","1: CancÃºn","1: Geneva","1: Switzerland","1: Paris","1: France","1: People's_Republic_of_China","1: Economic_reforms_in_China","1: USSR","1: Centrally_planned_economy","1: Special_Economic_Zone","1: Price","1: Demand","1: Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation","1: Economy_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China","1: Gross_Domestic_Product","1: Amber_Road","1: Industrialization","1: Globalization","1: Multinational_corporation","1: Outsourcing","1: South_Korea","1: Export-oriented_industrialization","1: Trade_sanctions","1: Embargo","1: United_States_embargo_against_Cuba","1: Cuba","1: Subsidy","1: Manual_labour","1: Environmental_movement","1: Social_issues","1: Commodities","1: Third_World","1: Second_World","1: First_World","1: Human_right","1: Employment_law","1: Commercial_law","1: Slave_labour","1: Price_support","1: Non-governmental_organization","1: Fair_trade_labeling","1: University_of_Wales_Press"]}
