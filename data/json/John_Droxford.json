He was elected 5 February 1309 and consecrated 9\nNovember 1309. Fryde, et al. Handbook of British\nChronology p. 228\n\nDroxford, born probably at Drokensford, now Droxford, Hampshire, was controller\nof the wardrobe to King Edward I in 1291, and continued to hold that office\nuntil 1295, when he appears as keeper of the wardrobe. These offices kept him in\nconstant attendance at court. He accompanied Edward in the expeditions he made\nto Scotland in 1291 and 1296. In 1297 he discharged the duties of Treasurer\nduring a vacancy. The next year he was again busy in Scotland, and he appears to\nhave again accompanied Edward I on the expedition of 1303â4. His services were\nrewarded with ecclesiastical preferments; he was rector of Droxford, of\nHemingburgh and Stillingfleet in Yorkshire, and of Balsham in Cambridgeshire; he\nheld prebends in Southwell and four other collegiate churches in England,\nbesides certain prebends in Ireland; was installed as prebendary in the\ncathedral churches of Lichfield, Lincoln, and Wells; and was chaplain to the\npope. His secular emoluments were also large, for he appears to have had five\nresidences in Surrey, Hampshire, and Kent, besides a sixth estate in Chute\nForest, Wiltshire, and a grant of land in Windsor Forest. He is sometimes\nincorrectly styled Chancellor, or Keeper of the Great Seal, simply because on\none occasion, as keeper of the wardrobe, he had charge of the great seal for a\nfew days during a vacancy.\n\nAfter the death of Edward I Droxford ceased to hold office in the wardrobe, and\nin the first year of King Edward II sat in the exchequer as chancellor. On 25\nDecember 1308 the king, in sending his congÃ© d'Ã©lire to the cathedral chapters\nof Bath and Wells, nominated him for election; he received the temporalities of\nthe see on 15 May 1309, and was enthroned at Wells about twelve months\nafterwards. During the first four years of his episcopate he was seldom in his\ndiocese; \"political troubles\" he writes, in December 1312, \"having hindered our\nresidence\". In later years, though often in London and elsewhere, and paying an\nannual visit to his private estates, he was also much in Somerset. He did not\nmake either Bath or Wells his headquarters, but moved about constantly, attended\napparently by a large retinue, from one to another of the manor-houses, sixteen\nor more in number, attached to the see and used as episcopal residences.\nMagnificent and liberal, he was, like many of his fellow-bishops, a worldly man,\nand by no means blameless in the administration of his patronage, for he\nconferred a prebend on a member of the house of Berkeley who was a layman and a\nmere boy, and in the bountiful provision he made for his relations out of the\nrevenues of his church he was not always careful to act legally. He had some\ndisputes with his chapter which were settled in 1321.\n\nAlthough Droxford was left regent when the king and Queen Isabella crossed over\nto France in 1313, and was one of the commissioners to open parliament, he found\nhimself \"outrun in the race for secular preferment\" in the reign of Edward II,\nand probably for this reason was hostile to the king. He joined in the petition\nfor the appointment of ordainers in March 1310. In July 1321 he and others\nendeavoured to arrange a peace between the king and the malcontent lords at\nLondon. At the same time he was concerned in the rebellion against Edward, and\nin February 1323 the king wrote to Pope John XXII and the cardinals complaining\nof his conduct, and requesting that he should be translated to some see out of\nthe kingdom. He signed the letter sent by the bishops to the queen in 1325\nexhorting her to return to her husband, and on 13 January 1327 took the oath to\nsupport her and her son at the Guildhall of London.\n\nDroxford died at his episcopal manor-house at Dogmersfield, Hampshire, on 9 May\n1329, and was buried in St Katharine's Chapel in his cathedral church, where his\ntomb is still to be seen. Two months before his death he endowed a chantry to be\nestablished at the altar nearest to his grave.\n","linknr":191,"url":"John_Droxford","recorded":1375075937,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Droxford&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Droxford&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Bishop_of_Bath_and_Wells","/wiki/File:Johndrokensfield.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Johndrokensfield.JPG/220px-Johndrokensfield.JPG","/wiki/Wells_Cathedral","/wiki/Diocese_of_Bath_and_Wells","/wiki/Walter_Haselshaw","/wiki/Ralph_of_Shrewsbury","/wiki/Wells_Cathedral","/wiki/Bishop_of_Wells","#cite_note-Handbook228-1","/w/index.php?title=Droxford,_Hampshire&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Edward_I_of_England","/wiki/Keeper_of_the_wardrobe","/wiki/Lord_High_Treasurer","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/Cambridgeshire","/wiki/Prebend","/wiki/Cathedral_church","/wiki/Lichfield_Cathedral","/wiki/Lincoln_Cathedral","/wiki/Wells_Cathedral","/wiki/Surrey","/wiki/Hampshire","/wiki/Kent","/w/index.php?title=Chute_Forest,_Wiltshire&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Windsor_Forest","/wiki/Lord_Chancellor","/wiki/Lord_Keeper_of_the_Great_Seal","/wiki/Edward_II_of_England","/wiki/Exchequer","/wiki/Cathedral_chapter","/wiki/Temporalities","/wiki/Somerset","/wiki/Isabella_of_France","/wiki/Lord_Ordainers","/wiki/Pope_John_XXII","/w/index.php?title=Dogmersfield,_Hampshire&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Chantry","/w/index.php?title=John_Droxford&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Handbook228_1-0","/w/index.php?title=John_Droxford&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0-521-56350-X","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Public_domain","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Drokensford,_John_de_(DNB00)","/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography","/wiki/Catholic_Church","/wiki/Walter_Haselshaw","/wiki/Bishop_of_Bath","/wiki/Ralph_of_Shrewsbury","/wiki/Template:Bishops_of_Bath_and_Wells","/wiki/Template_talk:Bishops_of_Bath_and_Wells","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bishops_of_Bath_and_Wells&action=edit","/wiki/Bishop_of_Bath_and_Wells","/wiki/Bishop_of_Bath_and_Wells","/wiki/Roger_of_Salisbury_(Bishop_of_Bath_and_Wells)","/wiki/William_of_Bitton_I","/wiki/Walter_Giffard","/wiki/William_of_Bitton_II","/wiki/Robert_Burnell","/wiki/William_of_March","/wiki/Walter_Haselshaw","/wiki/Ralph_of_Shrewsbury","/wiki/John_Barnet","/wiki/John_Harewell","/wiki/Walter_Skirlaw","/wiki/Ralph_Ergham","/wiki/Richard_Clifford","/wiki/Henry_Bowet","/wiki/Nicholas_Bubwith","/wiki/John_Stafford_(bishop)","/wiki/Thomas_Beckington","/wiki/Robert_Stillington","/wiki/Richard_Foxe","/wiki/Oliver_King","/wiki/Adriano_Castellesi","/wiki/Thomas_Wolsey","/wiki/John_Clerk_(bishop)","/wiki/William_Knight_(bishop)","/wiki/William_Barlow_(bishop_of_Chichester)","/wiki/Gilbert_Bourne","/wiki/Gilbert_Berkeley","/wiki/Thomas_Godwin_(bishop)","/wiki/John_Still","/wiki/James_Montague_(bishop)","/wiki/Arthur_Lake_(bishop)","/wiki/William_Laud","/wiki/Leonard_Mawe","/wiki/Walter_Curle","/wiki/William_Piers","/wiki/Robert_Creighton","/wiki/Peter_Mews","/wiki/Thomas_Ken","/wiki/Richard_Kidder","/wiki/George_Hooper","/wiki/John_Wynne","/wiki/Edward_Willes","/wiki/Charles_Moss_(bishop_of_Bath_and_Wells)","/wiki/Richard_Beadon","/wiki/George_Law_(bishop)","/wiki/Richard_Bagot_(bishop)","/wiki/Robert_Eden,_3rd_Baron_Auckland","/wiki/Lord_Arthur_Hervey","/wiki/George_Kennion","/wiki/Wynne_Willson","/wiki/Francis_Underhill","/wiki/William_Wand","/wiki/Harold_Bradfield","/wiki/Edward_Henderson_(bishop)","/wiki/John_Bickersteth","/wiki/George_Carey","/wiki/Jim_Thompson_(bishop)","/wiki/Peter_Price_(bishop)","/wiki/Peter_Maurice_(bishop)","/wiki/Bishop_of_Taunton","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Droxford&oldid=556497818","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Bishops_of_Bath_and_Wells","/wiki/Category:1329_deaths","/wiki/Category:Lord_High_Treasurers_of_England","/wiki/Category:Articles_incorporating_DNB_text_with_Wikisource_reference","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_August_2011","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_mi
