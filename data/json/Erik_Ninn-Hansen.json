He served in the\nCabinet of Hilmar Baunsgaard, first as Defence Minister, and later as Finance\nMinister. In the early 1970s he became leader of the Conservative People's\nParty, but without much success, as the party slumped to its worst-ever results\nin the 1973 and 1975 elections.

When the story broke in 1989, Ninn-Hansen was forced to resign\nas cabinet minister. He served as Speaker of Parliament, but as the scope of the\nscandal increased, he was forced to resign this office as well. An independent\ninquiry headed by a Supreme Court Judge was set up to investigate the affair in\nthe late 1980s. The resulting report of this committee led to the resignation of\nthe Conservative-Liberal government in 1993.\n\nLater that year, Erik Ninn-Hansen became the first person since 1910 to be\nimpeached for high crimes and misdemeanours committed as a cabinet minister. In\n1995 he was convicted on three charges of abuse of power, and was given a four\nmonths suspended prison sentence. Thi kendes for ret. Dokument. Rigsrettens\ndom over forhenvÃ¦rende justitsminister Erik Ninn- Hansen afsagt 22. juni 1995.\nWeekendavisen, 23.06.1995, 1._sektion, Side 3 The most important task in\nthe impeachment process had been to establish responsibility for the affair. Ninn-\nHansen's advanced age and poor health weighed against a full prison term.\n\nAn additional case of ministerial wrongdoing surfaced in 2007. Allegedly, Ninn-\nHansen, then Minister of Justice, ordered that the ministry shelved requests to\nthe French courts to have two Palestinian PFLP prisoners and 6 mio. DKK handed\nover to the Danish justice system, presumably out of fears for new acts of\nterror on Denmark. Blekingegadesagen krÃ¦ver en\nkulegravning. Kristeligt-Dagblad, 05.01.2008 The two PFLP members were\npresumably connected the notorious Danish terror cell Blekingegadebanden and had\nbeen caught on the 26 March 1984 trying to leave De Gaulle airport France with\nsix million DKK in suitcases, on their way to Damaskus. RÃ¸veriet der ikke skulle opklares. Berlingske Tidende, 04.01.2008,\n1. SEKTION, Side 10 Earlier that month, on the 2nd March 1983, a Danish\nmoney transport had been robbed of 8.3 mio. DKK by Blekingegadebanden in\nKÃ¸bmagergadekuppet, in which a young policeman was shot dead. Police officers\nresponsible for the investigation were silenced by the Ministry of Justice and\nordered to cease the investigation. Relevant files in the ministry of justice\nhave routinely been destroyed, and Erik Ninn-Hansen either cannot or will not\nrecall any details. Krav om undersÃ¸gelse af\nJustitsministeriet. Berlingske Tidende, 24.10.2007, 1. SEKTION, Side 8 The author Peter Ãvig Knudsen discovered correspondence\nbetween the French and Danish authorities in the files of the ministry of\nforeign affairs, as the communications had taken place under the auspiced of\nthat ministry. In 2008 an ongoing investigative commission of cold war affairs,\nthe so-called PET-kommissionen, was asked also to report on this issue. In 2009\nit concluded that both the French and Danish authorities mutually and silently\nhad agreed not to prosecute the PLFP prisoners, but also that it was within the\ndiscretion of Ninn-Hansen to take such a decision and that he cannot be\ncriticized. There have been several calls in parliament for a new in-depth\ninvestigation of this issue.
