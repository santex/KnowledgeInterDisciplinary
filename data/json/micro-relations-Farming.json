Agriculture\nwas the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby\nfarming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the\ndevelopment of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural\nscience. Agriculture generally speaking refers to human activities, although it\nis also observed in certain species of ant and termite.\nThe word agriculture is the English adaptation of Latin agricultÅ«ra, from ager,\n\"a field\", [http://catholic.archives.nd.edu/cgi-\nbin/lookup.pl?stem=ager&ending= Latin Word Lookup] and cultÅ«ra,\n\"cultivation\" in the strict sense of \"tillage of the soil\". [http://catholic.archives.nd.edu/cgi-\nbin/lookup.pl?stem=cultura&ending= Latin Word Lookup] Thus, a literal\nreading of the word yields \"tillage of fields\".\n\nThe history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development\nhas been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and\ntechnologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and\nmaintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For\nplants, this usually requires some form of irrigation, although there are\nmethods of dryland farming; pastoral herding on rangeland is still the most\ncommon means of raising livestock. In the developed world, industrial\nagriculture based on large-scale monoculture has become the dominant system of\nmodern farming, although there is growing support for sustainable agriculture\n(e.g. permaculture or organic agriculture).\n\nUntil the Industrial Revolution, the vast majority of the human population\nlabored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically subsistence\nagriculture in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own\nconsumption instead of for trade. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices\nhas occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the\ndevelopment of world markets. This also led to technological improvements in\nagricultural techniques, such as the Haber-Bosch method for synthesizing\nammonium nitrate which made the traditional practice of recycling nutrients with\ncrop rotation and animal manure less necessary.\n\nModern agronomy, plant breeding, and agrochemicals such as pesticides and\nfertilizers, and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from\ncultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and\nnegative human health effects. Selective breeding and modern\npractices in animal husbandry such as intensive pig farming have similarly\nincreased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal cruelty and\nthe health effects of the antibiotics, growth hormones, and other chemicals\ncommonly used in industrial meat production.\n\nThe major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers,\nfuels, and raw materials. In the 21st century, plants have been used to grow\nbiofuels, biopharmaceuticals, bioplastics, and\npharmaceuticals. Specific foods include cereals, vegetables, fruits,\nand meat. Fibers include cotton, wool, hemp, silk and flax. Raw materials\ninclude lumber and bamboo. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such\nas resins. Biofuels include methane from biomass, ethanol, and biodiesel. Cut\nflowers, nursery plants, tropical fish and birds for the pet trade are some of\nthe ornamental products. Regarding food production, the World Bank targets\nagricultural food production and water management as an increasingly global\nissue that is fostering an important and growing debate.\n\nIn 2007, one third of the world's workers were employed in agriculture. The\nservices sector has overtaken agriculture as the economic sector employing the\nmost people worldwide. Despite the size of its workforce,\nagricultural production accounts for less than five percent of the gross world\nproduct (an aggregate of all gross domestic products).\n","linknr":1835,"url":"Farming","recorded":1362892741,"links":237,"instances":["plough","environmental","bird","herbicide","agriculture","tool","biology","economics","region","horticulture","plant","economics","legume","food","agriculture"],"pdf":["http://cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1860.pdf","http://cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1860.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-128/pdfs/2003128.PDF","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/22/10/579.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071024233407/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/22/10/579.pdf","http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/22/10/579.pdf","http://www.rafiusa.org/pubs/Farmers_Guide_to_GMOs.pdf","http://www.geography.siu.edu/courses/429/AgroEco/AgroEcoB.pdf","http://www.geography.siu.edu/courses/429/AgroEco/AgroEcoB.pdf","http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf","http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf","http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf","http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf","http://www.ces.edu.uy/Relaciones_Publicas/BoletinPrensa/2007-08/20070824.pdf","http://www.ces.edu.uy/Relaciones_Publicas/BoletinPrensa/2007-08/20070824.pdf","http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/eceee07/white.pdf","http://css.snre.umich.edu/css_doc/CSS00-04.pdf","http://ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/04nov/RL32677.pdf","http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/researchreports/nk01ltar.pdf","http://www.bio.org/ind/GrowingEnergy.pdf"],"categories":["Agriculture"],"headings":["History","Contemporary
