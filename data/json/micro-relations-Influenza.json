The most common symptoms are chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains,\nheadache (often severe), coughing, weakness/fatigue and general discomfort. {{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec17/ch198/ch198d.html\n|title=Influenza: Viral Infections: Merck Manual Home Edition |publisher=Merck\n|accessdate=15 March 2008 }}  Although it is often confused with other influenza-\nlike illnesses, especially the common cold, influenza is a more severe disease\ncaused by a different type of virus. Influenza may\nproduce nausea and vomiting, particularly in children, but\nthese symptoms are more common in the unrelated gastroenteritis, which is\nsometimes inaccurately referred to as \"stomach flu\" or \"24-hour\nflu\". [http://coldflu.about.com/od/flumisconceptions/f/stomachflu.htm\nSeasonal Flu vs. Stomach Flu] by Kristina Duda, R.N.; Retrieved 12 March 2007\n(Website: \"About, Inc., A part of The New York Times Company\")\n\nFlu can occasionally lead to pneumonia, either direct viral pneumonia or\nsecondary bacterial pneumonia, even for persons who are usually very\nhealthy. In particular\nit is a warning sign if a child (or presumably an adult) seems to be getting\nbetter and then relapses with a high fever as this relapse may be bacterial\npneumonia. Another warning sign is if the\nperson starts to have trouble breathing.\n\nTypically, influenza is transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes,\ncreating aerosols containing the virus. Influenza can also be transmitted by\ndirect contact with bird droppings or nasal secretions, or through contact with\ncontaminated surfaces. Airborne aerosols have been thought to cause most\ninfections, although which means of transmission is most important is not\nabsolutely clear. Influenza viruses can be inactivated by\nsunlight, disinfectants and detergents.

Physical characteristics of\ninfluenza A viruses. UMN CIDRAP. As the virus can be inactivated by soap,\nfrequent hand washing reduces the risk of infection.\n\nInfluenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in about\nthree to five million yearly cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to\n500,000 yearly deaths, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/\nInfluenza (Seasonal)], World Health Organization, April 2009. Retrieved 13\nFebruary 2010. rising to millions in some pandemic years. In the 20th\ncentury three influenza pandemics occurred, each caused by the appearance of a\nnew strain of the virus in humans, and killed tens of millions of people. Often,\nnew influenza strains appear when an existing flu virus spreads to humans from\nanother animal species, or when an existing human strain picks up new genes from\na virus that usually infects birds or pigs. An avian strain named H5N1 raised\nthe concern of a new influenza pandemic after it emerged in Asia in the 1990s,\nbut it has not evolved to a form that spreads easily between people.\nIn April 2009 a novel flu strain evolved that combined genes from human, pig,\nand bird flu. Initially dubbed \"swine flu\" and also known as influenza A/H1N1,\nit emerged in Mexico, the United States, and several other nations. The World\nHealth Organization officially declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 June\n2009 (see 2009 flu pandemic). The WHO's declaration of a pandemic level 6 was an\nindication of spread, not severity, the strain actually having a lower mortality\nrate than common flu outbreaks. World Health Organization.

Farmed poultry is often vaccinated to\navoid decimation of the flocks. The most common human vaccine is the\ntrivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) that contains purified and inactivated\nantigens from three viral strains. Typically, this vaccine includes material\nfrom two influenza A virus subtypes and one influenza B virus strain.\nThe TIV carries no risk of transmitting the disease, and it has very low\nreactivity. A vaccine formulated for one year may be ineffective in the\nfollowing year, since the influenza virus evolves rapidly, and new strains\nquickly replace the older ones. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase\ninhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) have been used to treat influenza; World Health Organization, Global Alert and Response\n(GAR),
