His prize of 50 gold\nsovereigns was used to buy a handmade gold pocket watch, in which he had his\ninitials 'N.C.C' inscribed. He moved to Stawell, hoping to win another Gift, and\nhe played two seasons with Stawell Football Club.\n\nUpon his arrival at Carlton in 1905, his team-mates noticed his exceptional\nphysique and nicknamed him \"Hackenschmidt\" after the famous strongman and\nprofessional wrestler, Georg Hackenschmidt.\n\nHe played in three consecutive premiership sides for Carlton from 1906â1908 as\nwell as coaching Carlton to back-to-back premierships in 1914â15. He was\ntherefore one of the only men involved in Carlton's first five flags.\n\nAfter leaving Carlton at the end of the 1918 season he took up the head\ncoaching role at Richmond. In his first season, he took the Tigers to the Grand\nFinal. This attained him the rare feat of coaching two separate clubs in VFL\nGrand Finals.\n\nClark was also the coach of VFL sides St Kilda in 1925â26 and North Melbourne in\n1931. He was Captain/Coach of Victorian Football Association (VFA) side Brighton\nin 1913. He coached junior and senior football for seventeen seasons in the VFA,\nthe VFL and the Ringwood Districts Football Association, with four more\npremierships to his credit by the time he retired after the 1931 season.\n\nClark died on Boxing Day in 1943. He was survived by his wife Eileen (deceased)\nand two sons Norman (Adrian) and Brian (both deceased).\n","linknr":333,"url":"Norm_Clark","recorded":1375083397,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Norm_Clark&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Norm_Clark&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Norm_Clarke","/wiki/Stawell_Football_Club","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/St_Kilda_Football_Club","/wiki/North_Melbourne_Football_Club","/wiki/Brighton_Football_Club","/wiki/North_Melbourne_Football_Club","/wiki/Prahran_Football_Club","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/1906_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/1907_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/1908_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/1914_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/1915_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/Australian_rules_football","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/VFL/AFL","/wiki/North_Adelaide_Roosters","/wiki/Sprint_(race)","/wiki/Stawell_Gift","/wiki/Stawell_Football_Club","/wiki/Strongman_(strength_athlete)","/wiki/Professional_wrestling","/wiki/Georg_Hackenschmidt","/wiki/Richmond_Football_Club","/wiki/St_Kilda_Football_Club","/wiki/North_Melbourne_Football_Club","/wiki/Victorian_Football_Association","/wiki/Brighton_Football_Club","/wiki/Boxing_Day","/w/index.php?title=Norm_Clark&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Norm_Clark&action=edit&section=2","http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-index.php?page=Norman+Clark","http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/N/Norman_Clark.html","http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/ci-cl.htm#Norman%20'Hackenschmidt'%20Clark%20(North%20Adelaide,%20Carlton,%20Richmond,%20Brighton,%20St%20Kilda,%20North%20Melbourne)","http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=2","http://www.mcc.org.au/About%20the%20MCC/Heritage/MCC%20Library/~/media/Files/Library%20Fact%20Sheet_CarlvRich_2010-08-14.pdf","/wiki/Template:1906/07/08_Carlton_Blues_triple_premiership_players","/wiki/Template_talk:1906/07/08_Carlton_Blues_triple_premiership_players","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1906/07/08_Carlton_Blues_triple_premiership_players&action=edit","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/1906_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/1907_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/1908_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/Les_Beck","/wiki/George_Bruce_(footballer)","/wiki/Jim_Flynn_(footballer)","/wiki/Charlie_Hammond","/wiki/Fred_Jinks","/wiki/George_S._Johnson","/wiki/Ted_Kennedy_(footballer)","/wiki/Alex_Lang","/wiki/Billy_Payne_(footballer)","/wiki/George_Topping","/wiki/Jack_Worrall","/wiki/Template:1914/15_Carlton_Blues_dual_premiership_players","/wiki/Template_talk:1914/15_Carlton_Blues_dual_premiership_players","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1914/15_Carlton_Blues_dual_premiership_players&action=edit","/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club","/wiki/1914_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/1915_VFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/Alf_Baud","/wiki/Percy_Daykin","/wiki/Andy_McDonald_(footballer)","/wiki/Harry_Haughton","/wiki/Ernie_Jamieson","/wiki/Ted_Brown_(Australian_footballer)","/wiki/Paddy_O%27Brien_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Rod_McGregor","/wiki/Charlie_Fisher","/wiki/Charlie_Hammond","/wiki/Gordon_Green","/wiki/Jimmy_Morris_(footballer)","/wiki/Herb_Burleigh","/wiki/Template:Carlton_Football_Club_coaches","/wiki/Template_talk:Carlton_Football_Club_coaches","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Carlton_Football_Club_coaches&action=edit","/wiki/List_of_Carlton_Football_Club_coaches","/wiki/Jack_Worrall","/wiki/Fred_Elliott_(footballer)","/wiki/Jack_Wells_(footballer)","/wiki/Viv_Valentine","/wiki/Horrie_Clover","/wiki/Percy_Parratt","/wiki/Jim_Caldwell_(footballer)","/wiki/Paddy_O%27Brien_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Ray_Brew","/wiki/Horrie_Clover","/wiki/Ray_Brew","/wiki/Dan_Minogue","/wiki/Frank_Maher_(footballer)","/wiki/Percy_Rowe","/wiki/Brighton_Diggins","/wiki/Percy_Bentley","/wiki/Jim_Francis","/wiki/Ken_Hands","/wiki/Ron_Barassi","/wiki/John_Nicholls_(footballer)","/wiki/Keith_McKenzie_(Australian_footballer)","/wiki/Ian_Thorogood","/wiki/Ian_Stewart_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/Sergio_Silvagni","/wiki/Alex_Jesaulenko","/wiki/Peter_Jones_(Australian_rules_footballer)","/wiki/David_Parkin","/wiki/Robert_Walls","/wiki/Alex_Jesaulenko","/wiki/David_Parkin","/wiki/Wayne
