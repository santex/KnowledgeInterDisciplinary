Page 19.\n\nIn Attorney General for New South Wales v Love, the appellant argued that\nsection 24 of the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 did not have the effect applying the Nullum\nTempus Act (9 Geo 3 c 16) (1768) to New South Wales. Counsel for the appellant\nsaid that Whicker v Hume Whicker v Hume (1858) 7 HL 124 decided that\nsection 24 referred not to laws generally, but only to laws as to modes of\nprocedure, and that the Nullum Tempus Act did not deal merely with procedure.\nThe Lord Chancellor said that the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 prima facie \"applied the\nNullum Tempus Act to the Colony in question as much as if it had re-enacted it\nfor that Colony.\" He then said:\n\n\n\nThe following matters and things pertain to the administration of justice: the\norganisation of the courts; the prerogative of justice, the prerogative of\nmercy, and any prerogative power to create new courts; nolle prosequi; the\nappointment, tenure and immunity of judges; the immunity of other participants\nin legal proceedings; contempt of court; the composition and availability of\njuries, any requirement that their verdict be unanimous, and the allowances they\nreceive; the branches of the legal profession; and the provision of legal aid\nand advice. O. Hood Phillips. A First Book of English Law. Fourth Edition.\nSweet & Maxwell. 1960. Chapter 2. (These matters and things are discussed by the\nauthor in a chapter titled \"The Administration of Justice\").\n\nThe administration of justice is an act which is normally associated with the\ncarrying on of the business of government. When a government does that act, it\nis thereby exercising its sovereignty. It would accordingly be a violation of\nBritish sovereignty for a foreign government to do that act in British territory\nwithout authorisation. McNair, Sir Arnold Duncan. Legal Effects of War.\nSecond Edition. Cambridge University Press. 1944. Page 356.

An arrestable offence which\nconsisted of making a threat was serious for the purposes of that Act if\ncarrying out the threat would be likely to lead to, amongst other things,\nserious interference with the administration of justice.

Where in proceedings\nfor any offence which is an administration of justice offence for the purposes\nof section 54 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 it appears\nto the court that there is a possibility that (by virtue of that section)\nproceedings may be taken against a person for an offence of which he has been\nacquitted, section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 applies as if those\nproceedings were pending or imminent: The Contempt of Court Act 1981, section\n4(2A).\n\nInformation which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 of the\nFreedom of Information Act 2000 is exempt information if its disclosure under\nthat Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the administration of\njustice.
