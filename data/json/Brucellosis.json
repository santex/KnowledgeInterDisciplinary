Transmission from human to human, through sexual contact or from\nmother to child, is rare but possible.\n\n[[Brucella]] spp. are small, Gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod\nshaped (coccobacilli) bacteria. They function as facultative intracellular\nparasites causing chronic disease, which usually persists for life. Symptoms\ninclude profuse sweating and joint and muscle pain. Brucellosis has been\nrecognized in animals including humans since the 20th century.\n","linknr":722,"url":"Brucellosis","recorded":1362501577,"links":64,"instances":["microbiology","microbiologist","epidemiology","biology","politician"],"pdf":["http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/brucellosis-pathway.pdf","http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/brucellosis-pathway.pdf","http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf","http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf","http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/40/3/321.pdf","http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/40/3/321.pdf","http://www.vermontbeefproducers.org/NewFiles/AsktheVet/Fall%2002.pdf","http://www.vermontbeefproducers.org/NewFiles/AsktheVet/Fall%2002.pdf"],"categories":["Zoonotic bacterial diseases","Bacterium-related cutaneous conditions","Animal diseases","Occupational diseases","Zoonoses","Dog diseases","Biological weapons"],"headings":["History and nomenclature","Brucellosis in animals","Brucellosis in humans","Control and eradication efforts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Brucella_spp.JPG/230px-Brucella_spp.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Brucella_granuloma.jpg/250px-Brucella_granuloma.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/B.melitensis_in_Europe.svg/300px-B.melitensis_in_Europe.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sterilization","microbiology"],["david_bruce","microbiologist"],["cell","biology"],["endemic","epidemiology"],["brendan_smith","politician"]],"members":["sterilization","david_bruce","endemic","cell","brendan_smith"],"related":["Zoonosis","Sterilization_(microbiology)","Milk","Meat","Sexual_contact","Gram-negative","Coccobacillus","Parasitic_plant","United_Kingdom","Crimean_War","David_Bruce_(microbiologist)","Denmark","Veterinarian","Bernhard_Lauritz_Frederik_Bang","Maltese_people","Themistocles_Zammit","Knighthood","Pasteurization","Neurologists","Milk_sickness","Brucella_melitensis","Swine_brucellosis","Spontaneous_abortion","Placenta","Erythritol","Seminal_vesicle","Ampulla_of_ductus_deferens","Testicle","Epididymis","Dog","Lymphatic_system","Human_eye","Kidney","Intervertebral_disc","Discospondylitis","Scrotum","Orchitis","Uveitis","Necrosis","Fever","Anaemia","Headache","Clinical_depression","Fever","Septicaemia","Arthralgia","Myalgia","Leukopenia","Anemia","Spondylodiscitis","Sacroiliitis","Orchitis","Hepatitis","Arthritis","Spondylitis","Anaemia","Leukopenia","Thrombocytopenia","Meningitis","Uveitis","Optic_neuritis","Endocarditis","Antibiotic","Tetracycline","Rifampicin","Aminoglycoside","Streptomycin","Gentamicin","Cell_(biology)","Streptomycin","Doxycycline","Gentamicin","Intramuscular_injection","Pasteurization","Cheese","Rifampin","Endocarditis","Brucella_melitensis","Biological_warfare","Pine_Bluff_Arsenal","World_War_II","U.S._Air_Force","M114_bomblet","Anthrax","Veterinarian","Vaccination","Zoonosis","Bison","Elk","Yellowstone","Canada","Endemic_(epidemiology)","Pasteurised","Temi_Zammit","Republic_of_Ireland","Government_of_Ireland","European_Commission","Brendan_Smith_(politician)","Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine","Department_of_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine","Australia","New_Zealand","Swine_brucellosis","Wildlife_disease","Andrew_Moynihan","KIT_Biomedical_research","Centers_for_Disease_Control","European_Centre_for_Disease_Prevention_and_Control"]}
