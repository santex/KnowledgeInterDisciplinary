{"cursor":"88692","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Net neutrality' (also 'network neutrality', 'Internet neutrality') is the\nprinciple that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data\non the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user,\ncontent, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, and modes of\ncommunication.\n\nThere has been extensive debate about whether net neutrality should be required\nby law. Since the early 2000s, advocates of net neutrality and associated rules\nhave raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their last\nmile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites,\nservices, and protocols), and even block out competitors. (The term \"net\nneutrality\" didn't come into popular use until several years later, however.)\nThe possibility of regulations designed to mandate the neutrality of the\nInternet has been subject to fierce debate, especially in the United States.\n\nNeutrality proponents claim that telecom companies seek to impose a tiered\nservice model in order to control the pipeline and thereby remove competition,\ncreate artificial scarcity, and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise\nuncompetitive services. Many believe net neutrality to be primarily important as\na preservation of current freedoms. Vinton Cerf,\nconsidered a \"father of the Internet\" and co-inventor of the Internet Protocol,\nTim Berners-Lee, creator of the Web, and many others have spoken out in favor of\nnet neutrality.\n\nOpponents of net neutrality claim that broadband service providers have no plans\nto block content or degrade network performance. Despite this claim, there has been a single case\nwhere an Internet service provider, Comcast, intentionally slowed peer-to-peer\n(P2P) communications. {{cite news\n | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21376597/ title = Comcast Blocks some\n | Subscriber Internet Traffic, AP Testing shows author = Peter Svensson |\n | agency = Associated Press date = 19 October 2007 | accessdate =25 October\n | 2009 }} Still other companies have begun to use deep packet inspection\n | to discriminate against P2P, FTP, and online games, instituting a cell-phone\n | style billing system of overages, free-to-telecom \"value added\" services, and\n | bundling. Critics of net neutrality also argue that data\n | discrimination of some kinds, particularly to guarantee quality of service,\n | is not problematic, but is actually highly desirable. Bob Kahn, co-inventor\n | of the Internet Protocol, has called the term net neutrality a \"slogan\" and\n | states that he opposes establishing it, but he admits that he is against the\n | fragmentation of the net whenever this becomes excluding to other\n | participants. Partial transcript: [http://vasarely.wiwi.hu-\n | berlin.de/kahn_net_neutrality_transcript.html Hu-Berlin.de] Opponents\n | of net neutrality regulation also argue that the best solution to\n | discrimination by broadband providers is to encourage greater competition\n | among such providers, which is currently limited in many areas.\n","linknr":1096,"url":"Network_neutrality","recorded":1362543070,"links":75,"instances":["information_technology","author","software","protocol","united_states","networking","belgië","electronic","computing","policy_expert","engineering"],"pdf":["http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf","http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf","http://www.sdma.com/files/Publication/e078fa3a-8b3c-4bf5-b384-734f26afc9b3/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/ab2b71fb-ec17-47cf-aef1-7eb8bbb7073f/media_law-12_dec_2007.pdf","http://www.sdma.com/files/Publication/e078fa3a-8b3c-4bf5-b384-734f26afc9b3/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/ab2b71fb-ec17-47cf-aef1-7eb8bbb7073f/media_law-12_dec_2007.pdf","http://www.google.com/googleblogs/pdfs/verizon_google_legislative_framework_proposal_081010.pdf","http://www.google.com/googleblogs/pdfs/verizon_google_legislative_framework_proposal_081010.pdf","http://static.publicknowledge.org/pdf/nn-letter-20060301.pdf","http://static.publicknowledge.org/pdf/nn-letter-20060301.pdf","http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/cerf-020706.pdf","http://commerce.senate.gov/pdf/cerf-020706.pdf","http://dna-pubs.cs.columbia.edu/citation/paperfile/200/netneutrality.pdf","http://dna-pubs.cs.columbia.edu/citation/paperfile/200/netneutrality.pdf","http://www.freepress.net/docs/timwu.pdf","http://www.freepress.net/docs/timwu.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/1472/comm_pdf_sec_2007_1472_1_en_documentdetravail.pdf.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/1472/comm_pdf_sec_2007_1472_1_en_documentdetravail.pdf.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/698/com_2007_0698_en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/doc/library/proposals/698/com_2007_0698_en.pdf","http://www.dekamer.be/FLWB/PDF/53/1467/53K1467002.pdf","http://markey.house.gov/images/PDFs/netneutralitybill.pdf","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-09-23/pdf/2011-24259.pdf","http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/Releases/NewsLetter/Vol17/Vol17_13/Vol17_13.pdf","http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/Releases/NewsLetter/Vol17/Vol17_13/Vol17_13.pdf","http://rouskas.csc.ncsu.edu/Publications/Thesis/PHD-Lv-2010.pdf","http://rouskas.csc.ncsu.edu/Publications/Thesis/PHD-Lv-2010.pdf","http://www.dhv-speyer.de/PUBL/Vortraege/Heft96.pdf"],"categories":["Net
