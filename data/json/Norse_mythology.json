The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology\nconsists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous\nsources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval\nmanuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.\n\nNumerous gods are mentioned in the source texts, such as the hammer-wielding,\nmankind-protecting god Thor, who unrelentingly pursues his foes; the one-eyed,\nraven-flanked god Odin, who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and\nbestowed among mankind the runic alphabet; the beautiful, seiÃ°r-working,\nfeathered cloak-clad goddess Freyja who rides to battle to choose among the\nslain; the vengeful, skiing goddess SkaÃ°i, who prefers the wolf howls of the\nwinter mountains to the seashore; the powerful god NjÃ¶rÃ°r, who may calm both sea\nand fire and grant wealth and land; the god Freyr, whose weather and farming\nassociations bring peace and pleasure to mankind; the goddess IÃ°unn, who keeps\napples that grant eternal youthfulness; the mysterious god Heimdallr, who is\nborn of nine mothers, can hear grass grow, has gold teeth, and possesses a\nresounding horn; the half-god Loki, who brings tragedy to the gods by\nengineering the death of the goddess Frigg's beautiful son Baldr; and numerous\nother deities.\n\nMost of the surviving mythology centers on the plights of the gods and their\ninteraction with various other beings, such as mankind and the jÃ¶tnar, beings\nwho may be friends, lovers, foes and/or family members of the gods. The cosmos\nin Norse mythology consist of Nine Worlds flanked a central cosmological tree;\nYggdrasil. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as\ndeities or beings. Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the\nworld is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two\nhumans are Ask and Embla. These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the\nevents of RagnarÃ¶k, where an immense battle occurs between the Gods and their\nenemies, and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There the\nsurviving gods will meet and the land will be fertile and green, and two humans\nwill repopulate the world.\n\nNorse mythology has been a discussion of scholarly interpretation and debate\nsince the 17th century, when key texts were brought to the attention to the\nintellectual circles of Europe. By way of comparative mythology and historical\nlinguistics, scholars have identified elements of Germanic mythology from Proto-Indo-\nEuropean mythology. In the modern period, the Romanticist Viking revival re-\nawoke an interest in the subject matter, and references to Norse mythology may\nnow be found throughout modern popular culture. The myths have further been\nrevived in a religious context among adherents of Germanic Neopaganism.\n","linknr":586,"url":"Norse_mythology","recorded":1362484550,"links":83,"instances":["sun","linguist","germanic_mythology","being"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Norse
