Fibers are often used in the manufacture of\nother materials. The strongest engineering materials are generally made as\nfibers, for example carbon fiber and Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.\n\nSynthetic fibers can often be produced very cheaply and in large amounts\ncompared to natural fibers, but for clothing natural fibers can give some\nbenefits, such as comfort, over their synthetic counterparts.\n","linknr":421,"url":"fibers","recorded":1362560991,"links":62,"instances":["textile","fiber","radar_countermeasure","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fibers|","Materials","Textiles"],"headings":["Textile fiber","Natural fibers","Synthetic fibers","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Kapok_seeds_I_IMG_8004.jpg/140px-Kapok_seeds_I_IMG_8004.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Veranotrigo.jpg/16px-Veranotrigo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg/16px-Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Fibreoptic.jpg/220px-Fibreoptic.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Alpackaull.jpg/110px-Alpackaull.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["matted","disambiguation"],["carbon","fiber"],["modal","textile"],["carbon","fiber"],["modal","textile"],["chaff","radar_countermeasure"]],"members":["modal","carbon","chaff","matted"],"related":["Rope","String","Composite_material","Matted_(disambiguation)","Paper","Felt","Carbon_(fiber)","Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene","Textile","Biodegradation","Fiber_crop","Cellulose","Lignin","Cotton","Cannabis_sativa","Jute","Flax","Ramie","Sisal","Bagasse","Paper","Textile","Wood_fibre","Engineered_wood","Fiberboard","Animal_fiber","Silkworm","Silk","Spider_silk","Sinew","Catgut","Wool","Sea_silk","Cashmere_wool","Mohair","Angora","Mineral_fiber","Asbestos","Mineral","Chrysotile","Serpentine_group","Amphibole","Amosite","Crocidolite","Tremolite","Anthophyllite","Actinolite","Wollastonite","Palygorskite","Synthetic_fiber","Petrochemical","Cellulose","Rayon","Modal_(textile)","Lyocell","Cellulose_fiber","Metallic_fiber","Stainless_steel_fiber","Carbon_(fiber)","Pyrolysis","Polyacrylonitrile","Silicon_carbide_fiber","Hydrocarbon","Silane","Fiberglass","Optical_fiber","Quartz","Silica_fiber","Sodium_silicate","Basalt_fiber","Cellulose_fiber","Cellulose","Modal_(textile)","Bamboo_fiber","Seaweed","Petrochemical","Nylon","Polyester","Vinylon","Vinyon","Olefin_fiber","Acrylic_fiber","Polyester","Carbon_fiber","Aramid","Twaron","Kevlar","Nomex","Polyethylene","Ultra_high_molecular_weight_polyethylene","Elastomer","Spandex","Polyurethane","Chaff_(radar_countermeasure)","Denier","Optical_fiber","Fiber_crop","Molded_pulp","Dietary_fiber","Glossary_of_differential_geometry_and_topology","Ceramic_matrix_composite"]}
