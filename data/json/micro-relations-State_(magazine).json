While the magazine claims to be \"going\nonline\", founding co-editor John Walshe admitted that it would be on an amateur\nbasis \"no one is going to be working full-time on it because we will all be\nworking elsewhere\". Originally the concept of the magazine involved a\nhard copy of which there was a charge to purchase, however after six issues it\nwas decided to make the magazine's content free to view online. The first issue\nappeared on Irish shelves on 6 March 2008  and featured\nMichael Stipe of R.E.M. on the cover. This immediately garnered\ncomparisons between the new magazine's similarities with [[Hot Press\n(magazine)|Hot Press]] who featured Stipe on their cover at the same time, a\nmove widely thought to be an attempt by Hot Press to stifle State's status as a\nserious 'alternative' to the more established local magazine. At a\nprice of â¬5.50, State charged â¬2 more than Hot Press.\n\nState is published by Roger Woolman and edited by two Hot Press alumni, John\nWalshe and Phil Udell. Contributors include [[Evening Herald]] columnist, [[The\nIrish Times]] reviewer and blogger Sinead Gleeson, Rolling Stone writer Kara\nManning, award-winning blogger Niall Byrne (a.k.a.

The magazine's art director, Simon Roche, was named designer of the\nyear by the Periodical Publishers Association of Ireland in December 2008.\n\nAs of September, 2008 State Magazine has redeveloped its website\n([http://www.state.ie state.ie]) and confirmed that there would not be a\nSeptember edition of the Magazine as they were overlooking future production of\nthe magazine. From October until December 2008 the magazine was made available\nfor free of charge from a number of venues around Ireland's major cities and\nonline from the magazine's website, following a number of other magazines such\nas Mongrel, Connected and Analogue Magazine in providing their print content\nfree of charge. The first freely distributed issue of State featured Kings of\nLeon on the cover. As of January 2009, the magazine will only be\navailable online from its website.\n","linknr":215,"url":"State_(magazine)","recorded":1362477379,"links":16,"instances":["band","band","musician","band","musician","editor","band","band","band","band","band","band","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Irish music magazines","Irish websites","Monthly magazines","Publications established in 2008","Magazines disestablished in 2009"],"headings":["Issues","Cross-border collaborations","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/State_Magazine.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2d/State-First-Issue-R.E.M.-Cover.jpg/180px-State-First-Issue-R.E.M.-Cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Flag_of_Ireland.svg/22px-Flag_of_Ireland.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_walshe","editor"],["muse","band"],["portishead","band"],["jape","band"],["the_national","band"],["interpol","band"],["pendulum","band"],["david_holmes","musician"],["oppenheimer","band"],["pivot","band"],["and_so_i_watch_you_from_afar","band"],["conor_o'brien","musician"],["villagers","band"]],"members":["pivot","portishead","interpol","david_holmes","john_walshe","and_so_i_watch_you_from_afar","oppenheimer","jape","the_national","villagers","muse","pendulum"],"related":["English_language","Music","Roger_Woolman","Phil_Udell","John_Walshe_(editor)","Republic_of_Ireland","Michael_Stipe","R.E.M.","Roger_Woolman","Kings_of_Leon","Michael_Stipe","Goldfrapp","The_Jimmy_Cake","Cadence_Weapon","Stiff_Little_Fingers","The_Kooks","Muse_(band)","Portishead_(band)","Jape_(band)","South_by_Southwest","Gemma_Hayes","Republic_of_Loose","The_National_(band)","Mick_Jagger","Iggy_Pop","Damien_Dempsey","Alanis_Morissette","Martha_Wainwright","The_Ting_Tings","Interpol_(band)","Tricky","The_Hold_Steady","Pendulum_(band)","Justin_Timberlake","ABBA","Electric_Picnic_2008","Tinariwen","David_Holmes_(musician)","Oppenheimer_(band)","Tindersticks","That_Petrol_Emotion","Bodytonic","Pivot_(band)","Belfast","Alphastates","And_So_I_Watch_You_From_Afar_(band)","Conor_O'Brien_(musician)","Villagers_(band)","The_Immediate"]}
