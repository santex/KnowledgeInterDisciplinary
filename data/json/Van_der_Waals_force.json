{"cursor":"19406","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn physical chemistry, the 'van der Waals force' (or 'van der Waals\ninteraction'), named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, is\nthe sum of the attractive or repulsive forces between molecules (or between\nparts of the same molecule) other than those due to covalent bonds, the hydrogen\nbonds, or the electrostatic interaction of ions with one another or with neutral\nmolecules or charged molecule. The term includes:\n\n* force between two permanent dipoles (Keesom force)\n* force between a permanent dipole and a corresponding induced dipole\n  (Debye force)\n* force between two instantaneously induced dipoles (London dispersion force).\n\nIt is also sometimes used loosely as a synonym for the totality of\nintermolecular forces. Van der Waals forces are relatively weak compared to\ncovalent bonds, but play a fundamental role in fields as diverse as\nsupramolecular chemistry, structural biology, polymer science, nanotechnology,\nsurface science, and condensed matter physics. Van der Waals forces define many\nproperties of organic compounds, including their solubility in polar and non-\npolar media.\n\nIn low molecular weight alcohols, the hydrogen-bonding properties of the polar\nhydroxyl group dominate the weaker van der Waals interactions. In higher\nmolecular weight alcohols, the properties of the nonpolar hydrocarbon chain(s)\ndominate and define the solubility. Van der Waals forces quickly vanish at\nlonger distances between interacting molecules.\n\nIn 2012, the first direct measurements of the strength of the van der Waals\nforce for a single organic molecule bound to a metal surface was made via atomic\nforce microscopy and corroborated with density functional calculations. htt-\np://www.columbia.edu/~sva2107/media/Aradhya_NMat_2012.pdf\n","linknr":363,"url":"Van_der_Waals_force","recorded":1362511372,"links":50,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.columbia.edu/~sva2107/media/Aradhya_NMat_2012.pdf"],"categories":["Intermolecular forces"],"headings":["Definition","London dispersion force","Van der Waals forces between macroscopic objects","Use by Geckos","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D.png/200px-Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/e/81e13c5d4c90ab1e30ccad56cf0b3fe6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/2/2d28d3ec293af30bbda7e11ca6922bfb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/5/6/556c3de6c165c00403913a30a1e2607f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/b/b/8bbd96ce577204680497bcc9df366c38.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/9/3/593736673bcd7c49179e2410bf4da565.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/9/5a98886ab87eb7ccea7cd91ae84496b9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Gecko_Leaftail_1.jpg/300px-Gecko_Leaftail_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Physical_chemistry","Netherlands","Scientist","Johannes_Diderik_van_der_Waals","Molecule","Covalent_bond","Hydrogen_bonds","Electrostatic_interaction","Ion","Molecular_dipole_moment","Molecular_dipole_moment","Debye_force","Molecular_dipole_moment","London_dispersion_force","Synonym","Supramolecular_chemistry","Structural_biology","Polymer_science","Nanotechnology","Surface_science","Condensed_matter_physics","Organic_chemistry","Chemical_polarity","Alcohol","Hydroxyl_group","Atomic_force_microscope","Density_functional_theory","Covalent_bond","Ionic_bond","Quantum_dynamics","Intermolecular_forces","Pauli_exclusion_principle","Electrostatic","Quadrupole","Multipole","Keesom_force","Willem_Hendrik_Keesom","Polarizability","Peter_J.W._Debye","Fritz_London","Anisotropic","Lennard-Jones_potential","Van_der_Waals_broadening","Van_der_Waals_molecules","Casimir_effect","Evgeny_Mikhailovich_Lifshitz","Fritz_London","Intermolecular_force","Molecule","Multipole_moments","London_dispersion_force","H._C._Hamaker","London_dispersion_force","Hamaker_constant","Many-body_problem","Retarded_potential","Evgeny_Lifshitz","D._Langbein","Boris_Derjaguin","Gecko","Dry_glue","Dieter_Langbein"]}
