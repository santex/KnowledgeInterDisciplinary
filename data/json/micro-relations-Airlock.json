{"cursor":"5167","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n.]] An 'airlock' is a device which permits the passage of people and objects\nbetween a pressure vessel and its surroundings while minimizing the change of\npressure in the vessel and loss of air from it. The lock consists of a small\nchamber with two airtight doors in series which do not open simultaneously.\n\nAn airlock may be used for passage between environments of different gases\nrather than different pressures, to minimize or prevent the gases from mixing.\n\nAn airlock may also be used underwater to allow passage between an air\nenvironment in a pressure vessel and a water environment outside, in which case\nthe airlock can contain air or water. This is called a 'floodable airlock' or an\n'underwater airlock', and is used to prevent water from entering a submersible\nvessel or an underwater habitat.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Airlock","recorded":1362267873,"links":26,"instances":["water_transport","parachute"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Spacecraft components","Types of gates"],"headings":["Use","Applications","Similar mechanisms","Fictional airlocks","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/STS-125_EVA3a.jpg/280px-STS-125_EVA3a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/SEAL_Delivery_Vehicle_Team_%28SDV%29_2.jpg/220px-SEAL_Delivery_Vehicle_Team_%28SDV%29_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lock","water_transport"],["airlock","parachute"]],"members":["lock","airlock"],"related":["Pressure_vessel","Pressure","Air","Hermetic_seal","Door","Submersible","Underwater_habitat","Lock_(water_transport)","Boyle's_law","Pressure_suit","Space_suit","Pressure_suit","Paranasal_sinus","Decompression_sickness","Scuba_diving","Decompression_tables","Aviation","Airplanes","Spacecraft","Space_station","Hyperbaric_chamber","Submarine","Diving_chamber","Underwater_habitat","Torpedo_tube","Escape_trunk","Cleanroom","Nuclear_reactor","Biochemistry","Laboratory","USF_Sun_Dome","BC_Place_Stadium","Electron_microscopes","Airlock_(parachute)","Fermentation_lock","Ethanol_fermentation","Revolving_door","Aviary","Science_fiction","H._Beam_Piper","Battlestar_Galactica","Suitport","Fermentation_lock","Sally_port"]}
