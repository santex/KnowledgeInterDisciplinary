While at UGA, Clayton\nfounded the Demosthenian Literary Society.\n\nAfter studying law under the tutelage of judge Thomas P. Carnes, Clayton was\nadmitted to the state bar in 1806 and began practicing law in Carnesville,\nGeorgia (which was named in the Judge's honor). In 1807, he married Judge\nCarnes' daughter, Julia, and they moved back to Athens in 1808. Clayton's\ngranddaughter, Julia Carnes King, would marry another famous UGA alumnus,\nHenry W. Grady.\n\nIn 1810, Clayton was elected to represent Clarke County in the Georgia House of\nRepresentatives and served through 1812. In that same year, he became the\nsecretary for the Board of Trustees for UGA. Clayton was appointed to the board\nin 1816 and remained on the board until his death.\n\nClayton also served as the clerk of the Georgia House from 1813 to 1815.
