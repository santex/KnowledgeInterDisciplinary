{"cursor":"2966","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'bursary' is an office for a bursar and his or her staff in a college\nor school.\n\nIn modern English usage, however, the term has become synonymous with monetary\nawards made by some institutions to individuals or groups of people who cannot\nafford to pay full fees. According to the [[Good Schools Guide]], a bursary is\n\"usually for helping out the impoverished but deserving and those fallen on hard\ntimes.\" http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/education-advice-and-\nhelp/scholarships-and-bursaries/money-matters.html?Itemid=52\n\nAccording to The Hobsons UK Boarding Schools Guide, http://www.boardingscho-\nols.hobsons.com/advice/advice_uk_fees_funding numerous independent schools\nhave bursary capability, namely grants from the school to help pay education\nfees. These are usually awarded after a \"means test\" of family income and are\nnot necessarily dependent on examination performance, although some account of\nacademic ability will be taken. Bursaries may be awarded in addition to\nscholarships where financial need is demonstrated and the prospective student\nwould otherwise be unable to enter the school.\n\nTo obtain such a bursary, it is customary for parents to be asked by the\nschoolâs bursar to fill in an application form, giving details of their\nfinancial circumstances, supported by documentary evidence, including capital\nassets. The application will be considered by the school in accordance with its\nbursary policy. The award will often only remain in force until the pupil has\nsat the next relevant public examination. Most schools will review bursaries\nannually to ensure that the justification for an award remains. In Britain any\naward made before GCSE will not necessarily continue to the A-level stage.\n\nThere are two types of bursary awarded by institutions (such as universities).\nThe first is a means-tested bursary which is available for all students whose\nparents earn under a threshold value per annum. It is often given out using a\nsliding scale, with people at the lowest end of the scale receiving a full\nbursary and the monetary award decreasing in value with proportion to the\nparental earnings.\n\nThe second type of bursary, also known as a \"scholarship\" or \"prize\", is one\nbased on performance. These awards are generally given for good performance in\nthe exams preceding university or college entrance in which the student achieves\ngrades above the standard entry. These can be awarded by the university or,\nsometimes, by companies.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Bursary","recorded":1374539727,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=edit","/wiki/Bursar","/wiki/Money","/wiki/Good_Schools_Guide","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Examination","/wiki/University","/wiki/Pay_scale","/wiki/Scholarship","/wiki/Prize","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/education-advice-and-help/scholarships-and-bursaries/money-matters.html?Itemid=52","#cite_ref-2","http://www.boardingschools.hobsons.com/advice/advice_uk_fees_funding","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=edit&section=2","http://www.goodschoolsguide.co.uk/education-advice-and-help/scholarships-and-bursaries/money-matters.html?Itemid=52","/wiki/Good_Schools_Guide","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bursary&oldid=559576549","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Student_financial_aid","/wiki/Category:Award_items","/wiki/Category:Academia","/wiki/Category:Scholarships_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Academic_awards","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_June_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_with_a_reason_field_from_June_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needing_cleanup_from_June_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bursary&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Bursary","/wiki/Bursary","/wiki/Talk:Bursary","#","/wiki/Bursary","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Bursary","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Bursary","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&oldid=559576549","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5000589","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Bursary&id=559576549","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Bursary","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Bursary&oldid=559576549&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Bursary&printable=yes","//cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bwrsari","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5000589#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursary","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Student
