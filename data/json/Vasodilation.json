{"cursor":"18269","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Vasodilation' refers to the widening of blood vessels. It\nresults from relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls,\nparticularly in the large veins, large arteries, and smaller arterioles. The\nprocess is essentially the opposite of vasoconstriction, which is the\nnarrowing of blood vessels.\n\nWhen blood vessels dilate, the flow of blood is increased due to a decrease in\nvascular resistance. Therefore, dilation of arterial blood vessels (mainly the\narterioles) decreases blood pressure. The response may be intrinsic (due to\nlocal processes in the surrounding tissue) or extrinsic (due to hormones or the\nnervous system). Additionally, the response may be localized to a specific organ\n(depending on the metabolic needs of a particular tissue, as during strenuous\nexercise), or it may be systemic (seen throughout the entire systemic\ncirculation).\n\nDrugs that cause vasodilation are termed 'vasodilators'.\n","linknr":884,"url":"Vasodilation","recorded":1362511071,"links":37,"instances":["biology","pharmacology","medicine","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiovascular
