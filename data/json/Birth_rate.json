The rate of births in a population is calculated in several\nways: live births from a universal registration system for births, deaths, and\nmarriages; population counts from a census, and estimation through specialized\ndemographic techniques. The birth rate (along with mortality and migration rate)\nare used to calculate population growth.\n\nThe crude birth rate is the number of births per 1,000 people per year. See\n\"Fertility rates\"; Economic Geography Glossary at University of Washington\nAnother term used interchangeably with birth rate is natality. When\nthe crude death rate is subtracted from the crude birth rate, the result is the\nrate of natural increase (RNI). This is equal to\nthe rate of population change (excluding migration).\n\nThe total (crude) birth rate (which includes all births)âtypically indicated as\nbirths per 1,000 populationâis distinguished from an age-specific rate (the\nnumber of births per 1,000 persons in an age group). The first known\nuse of the term \"birth rate\" in English occurred in 1859.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; text-\n     align:left\"\n|+ World historical and predicted crude birth rates (1950â2050) UN,\n|  medium variant, 2008 rev. -\n!Years!!CBR!!Years!!CBR\n|- 1950â1955||align=center|37.2||2000â2005||align=center|21.2 -\n||1955â1960||align=center|35.3||2005â2010||align=center|20.3\n|-\n||1960â1965||align=center|34.9||2010â2015||align=center|19.4\n|-\n||1965â1970||align=center|33.4||2015â2020||align=center|18.2\n|-\n||1970â1975||align=center|30.8||2020â2025||align=center|16.9\n|-\n||1975â1980||align=center|28.4||2025â2030||align=center|15.8\n|-\n||1980â1985||align=center|27.9||2030â2035||align=center|15.0\n|-\n||1985â1990||align=center|27.3||2035â2040||align=center|14.5\n|-\n||1990â1995||align=center|24.7||2040â2045||align=center|14.0\n|-\n||1995â2000||align=center|22.5||2045â2050||align=center|13.4\n|}\n\n\nIn 2012 the average global birth rate was 19.15 births per 1,000 total\npopulation, compared to 20.09 per 1,000 total population in\n2007.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Birth_rate","recorded":1372152322,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Population","Population ecology","Demography","Demographic economics","Fertility","Ageing"],"headings":["Political issues","{{anchor|Birth rate in different countries}}National birth rates","{{anchor|Methods of measuring birth rate}}Measurement methods","Factors affecting birth rate","{{anchor|Birth rate and the Demographic Transition Model}}Demographic transition","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Census","Demographics","Mortality_rate","Human_migration","Population_growth","Fertility_rates","Crude_death_rate","Rate_of_natural_increase","Italy","Malaysia","One-child_policy","Birth_control","Family_planning_in_Iran","Reproductive_health","Life_expectancy","Social_status","Demographic_transition","Economic_development","World_Population_Conference","Bucharest","Romania","Birth_control","Birth_control_pill","Condom","Abortion","Cairo","Egypt","Aegis","Hong_Kong","Special_administrative_region","China","U.S._National_Institutes_of_Health","Office_for_National_Statistics","Germany","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Great_Depression_in_the_United_States","Total_fertility_rate","Natalism","Antinatalism","Tax_on_childlessness","Family_planning","Birth_control","Sex_education","Abortion","Childbirth","Infant_mortality","Population_pyramid","Age_of_marriage","Contraception","Abortion","Child_labour","Demographic-economic_paradox","Measures_of_national_income_and_output","Poverty","Urbanization","Pension","Conflict","Death_rate","Population_ageing","Human_population_control","Total_fertility_rate","Aging_of_Europe","Aging_of_Japan","List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_birth_rate","List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate","Population_Matters"]}
