{"cursor":"51000","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn the 'United States', a 'law school' is an institution where students obtain a\nprofessional education in law after first obtaining an undergraduate degree.\n\nLaw schools in the U.S. issue the Juris Doctor degree (J.D.), which is a\nprofessional doctorate, Under\n\"Data notes\" this article mentions that the J.D. is a professional\ndoctorate. . Under \"other references\", this discusses\ndifferences between academic and professional doctorates, and contains a\nstatement that the J.D. is a professional doctorate Report by the German Federal\nMinistry of Education analysing the Chronicle of Higher Education from the U.S.\nand stating that the J.D. is a professional doctorate. and for most practitioners a terminal degree. Although most\nlaw schools only offer the traditional three-year program, several U.S. law\nschools offer an Accelerated JD program.\n\nOther degrees that are awarded include the Master of Laws (LL.M.) and the Doctor\nof Juridical Science (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) degrees, which can be more international\nin scope. Most law schools are colleges, schools, or other units within a larger\npost-secondary institution, such as a university. Legal education is very\ndifferent in the United States from that in many other parts of the world.\n\nAccording to a study by labor economists Michael Simkovic and Frank McIntyre, a\nlaw degree increases lifetime earnings by $1,000,000 compared to a bachelor's\ndegree. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2250585m Michael\nSimkovic & Frank McIntyre, The Economic Value of a Law Degree] This is\npresent value, as of the start of law school, and includes opportunity costs and\nfinancing costs. After taxes, the mean present value will be around $700,000.\nBecause law school tuition (less scholarships and grants) is often around\n$30,000 per year for 3 years, this means that a law graduate with average\noutcomes effectively becomes $600,000 richer as of the day he or she starts law\nschool. At the median, or 50th percentile, the pretax present value is $610,000\nand the after tax value is $430,000. After tuition, the law graduate becomes\naround $330,000 richer. Even toward the bottom of the distribution, the value of\na law degree will typically exceed its costs by hundreds of thousands of\ndollars.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nthe national average salary for lawyers in 2012 was above $130,000. [http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm United\nStates Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment\nStatistics, Lawyers] Salaries vary by geography, with higher average\nsalaries in big citiesâespecially New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Los\nAngelesâand lower salaries in rural areas. An unpublished table produced by the\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that unemployment rates among experienced\nlawyers are lower than those for most high-income occupations. [http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-\nbiggest-salary Tableau, Who's got the Biggest Salary] BLS data also\nsuggests that lawyer employment has grown slightly faster than other\noccupations, with lawyers comprising a growing share of the work force over the\nlast decade.\n\nHowever, not all recent law graduates work as lawyers. According to Simkovic and\nMcIntyre's study of U.S. Census Bureau data, around 40 percent of U.S. residents\nwith law degrees do not practice law. Law\ngraduates are disproportionately represented in leadership positions in business\nand government. The National Association for Legal\nCareer Professionals produces an annual report summarizing the employment of\nrecent graduates of U.S. law schools at a single point in time, 9 months of\ngraduation. Employment at that point is typically around 90 percent, although\nfrom 2009 to 2011, the numbers have been lower, at around 86 to 88 percent. [http://www.nalp.org/0712research National Association\nfor Law Placement] Approximately 2 percent of graduates were employed in\nnon-professional jobs. Approximately 75 to 85\npercent work in jobs classified by NALP as \"JD required\" or \"JD preferred\", and\nanother 5 percent work in other professional jobs.\nHowever, a law degree increases earnings, even including those who do not\npractice law.\n","linknr":587,"url":"Law_school_in_the_United_States","recorded":1375074697,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Law_school_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Law_school_in_the_United_States&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Legal_education_in_the_United_States","/wiki/File:Law_School_Oral_Arguments.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Law_School_Oral_Arguments.jpg/200px-Law_School_Oral_Arguments.jpg","/wiki/Pre-law","/wiki/Trial_practice","/wiki/Legal_clinic","/wiki/Juris_Doctor","/wiki/Master_of_Laws","/wiki/Doctor_of_Laws","/wiki/Law_School_Admission_Test","/wiki/Admission_to_the_bar_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Continuing_legal_education","/wiki/Law_School_Admission_Council","/wiki/American_Bar_Association","/wiki/Practising_Law_Institute","/wiki/Template:Legal_education_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Template_talk:Legal_education_in_the_United_States","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Legal_education_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/wiki/Professional_degree","/wiki/Legal_education_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Undergraduate_degree","/wiki/Law_schools","/wiki/Juris_Doctor","/wiki/Academic_degree","/wiki/Doctorate#Professional_doctorates","#cite_note-aaude2008-1","#cite_note-nsf2006-2","#cite_note-sdcba1969-3","#cite_note-utah2006-4","#cite_note-gfme2008-5","#cite_note-eb2002-6","/wiki/Terminal_degree","/wiki/Accelerated_JD_program","/wiki/Master_of_Laws","/wiki/Doctor_of_Juridical_Science","/wiki/College","/wiki/Higher_education","/wiki/University","/wiki/Legal_education","/wiki/United_States","#cite_note-Simk._Mc._Study-7","#cite_note-Simk._Mc._Study-7","#cite_note-BLS_OES_Lawyers-8","#cite_note-Tableau-9","#cite_note-Simk._Mc._Study-7","#cite_note-Simk._Mc._Study-7","#cite_note-NALP_Statistics-10","#cite_note-NALP_Statistics-10","#cite_note-NALP_Statistics-10","#cite_note-Simk._Mc._Study-7","#History","#History_of_women_in_law_school","#Admission","#Accreditation","#Curriculum","#Grades.2C_grading.2C_and_GPA_curves","#Accelerated_JD_Programs","#Pedagogical_methods","#Credentials_obtainable_while_in_law_school","#State_and_federal_court_clerkship","#United_States_Supreme_Court_clerkship","#Controversies_involving_US_law_schools","#Employment_statistics_and_salary_information","#Political_balance","#Law_school_rankings","#Top_tier_law_schools","#Regional_tiers_and_lower-tier_national_schools","#State-authorized_schools","#Unaccredited_schools","#Oldest_active_law_schools","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Law_school_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Reading_law","/wiki/Independent_study","/wiki/Apprenticeship","/wiki/Edward_Coke","/wiki/Institutes_of_the_Lawes_of_England","/wiki/William_Blackstone","/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Colonial_America","/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary","/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Lecture","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Litchfield_Law_School","/wiki/Tapping_Reeve","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Harvard_University","/wiki/Yale_University","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/American_Bar_Association","/wiki/Admission_to_the_bar_in_the_United_States","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-16","/w/index.php?title=Law_school_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Ada_Kepley","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Buffalo_Law_School&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-18","/wiki/University_of_Iowa","/wiki/University_of_Michigan","/wiki/Boston_University_Law_School","#cite_note-Stevens.2C_p._82-19","/wiki/Clara_S._Foltz","#cite_note-Stevens.2C_p._82-19","/wiki/Ellen_Spencer_Mussey","/wiki/Emma_Gillett","#cite_note-20","/wiki/Myra_Bradwell","/wiki/Bradwell_v._Illinois","/wiki/Belva_Ann_Lockwood","#cite_note-Stevens.2C_p._82-19","/wiki/Harvard_Law_School","#cite_note-Stevens.2C_p._83-21","/wiki/New_England_School_of_Law","#cite_note-Stevens.2C_p._83-21","#cite_note-Stevens.2C_p._84-22","/wiki/World_War_I","/wiki/Fordham_Law_School","/wiki/Yale_Law_School","#cite_note-Stevens.2C_p._84-22","/wiki/Northeastern_University_School_of_Law","#cite_note-23","/wiki/Harvard_Law_School","#cite_note-24","/wiki/Notre_Dame_Law_School","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-26","#cite_note-2
