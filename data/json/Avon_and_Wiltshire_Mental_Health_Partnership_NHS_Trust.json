{"cursor":"5516","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust' (AWP) is a NHS mental\nhealth trust providing adult mental health and related services in Wiltshire and\nthe former county of Avon, an area centered on Bristol.\n\nThe trust is headquartered in Chippenham, and offers services at a large number\nof sites including at Blackberry Hill Hospital, Callington Road Hospital, Green\nLane Hospital, Petherton Day Hospital, Royal United Hospital, St Martin's\nHospital, Savernake Hospital, Southmead Hospital and Weston General\nHospital. The trust is one of the largest mental health trusts in the\ncountry, providing services to 1.6 million people. It is organised into five strategic business units: *Adult services\n*Older people's services *Specialist drug and alcohol services *Specialised and\nsecure services *Research and development\n\nIn 2008 the Care Quality Commission rated mental health services run by the\ntrust as weak overall, along with 10 other mental health trusts\nnationally. A 2012 Care Quality Commission routine review found that\nthe trust failed in four out of five inspection areas, and had insufficient\nexperienced staff to meet needs. In 2013 the Care Quality\nCommission identified the trust as one of eight mental health trusts with units\nthat had dangerous staffing levels.\n\nFollowing a 2012 NHS South of England review of the trust that concluded that\n\"there is an urgent need to change the culture and leadership from one of\ncentral control to one in which all staff are positively engaged and involved in\ndetermining and delivering safe, high quality care\", the trust appointed a new\nchairman and will recruit a new chief executive.\n\nIn April 2013 the new Bristol Clinical Commissioning Group announced that\nfollowing complaints from staff and patients in Bristol, it would re-procure\nadult out-patients mental health services in Bristol from autumn 2014, enabling\nalternative suppliers to bid to operate the service which currently contibutes\nabout Â£40 million to AWP's income.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust","recorded":1375078337,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/NHS_mental_health_trust","/wiki/Mental_health","/wiki/Wiltshire","/wiki/Avon_(county)","/wiki/Bristol","/wiki/Chippenham","/wiki/Blackberry_Hill_Hospital","/w/index.php?title=Callington_Road_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Green_Lane_Hospital","/w/index.php?title=Petherton_Day_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Royal_United_Hospital","/w/index.php?title=St_Martin%27s_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Savernake_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Southmead_Hospital","/wiki/Weston_General_Hospital","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-statement-2010-2","/wiki/Care_Quality_Commission","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-telegraph-20130112-6","/wiki/NHS_South_of_England","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Clinical_Commissioning_Group","#cite_note-bbc-20130428-9","#cite_note-10","/w/index.php?title=Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://web.archive.org/web/20090427031703/http://www.awp.nhs.uk/templates/Page____843.aspx","http://www.awp.nhs.uk/templates/Page____843.aspx","#cite_ref-statement-2010_2-0","http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/reports/RVN_Avon_and_Wiltshire_MH_Partnership_NHS_Trust_November_2010_Annual_Statement_0.pdf","http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/reports/RVN_Avon_and_Wiltshire_MH_Partnership_NHS_Trust_November_2010_Annual_Statement_0.pdf","#cite_ref-3","http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Avon-Wiltshire-Mental-Health-Partnership-services-rated-weak-health-watchdog/story-11229845-detail/story.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19281868","#cite_ref-5","http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/reports/RVN_Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust_RVN1H_Trust_Headquarters_20120802.pdf","http://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/reports/RVN_Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust_RVN1H_Trust_Headquarters_20120802.pdf","#cite_ref-telegraph-20130112_6-0","http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/heal-our-hospitals/9797839/Seventeen-NHS-hospitals-have-dangerously-low-numbers-of-nurses.html","#cite_ref-7","http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18997986","#cite_ref-8","http://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/9844695.Mental_health_trust_wows_to_be_transparent_after_review_criticism/","#cite_ref-bbc-20130428_9-0","http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-22324310","#cite_ref-10","http://www.awp.nhs.uk/news-publications/trust-news/2013/april/inpatient-beds-excluded-from-tender/","/w/index.php?title=Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust&action=edit&section=2","http://www.awp.nhs.uk/","http://www.nhs.uk/Services/Trusts/Overview/DefaultView.aspx?id=2309","http://www.cqc.org.uk/directory/RVN","/wiki/Care_Quality_Commission","/wiki/File:NHS-logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/NHS-logo.jpg/40px-NHS-logo.jpg","/wiki/National_Health_Service","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust&action=edit","/wiki/Template:NHS-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:NHS-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:NHS-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust&oldid=552583435","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:National_Health_Service_stubs","/wiki/Category:NHS_mental_health_trusts","/wiki/Category:Avon","/wiki/Category:Organisations_based_in_Wiltshire","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Avon+and+Wiltshire+Mental+Health+Partnership+NHS+Trust&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Avon+and+Wiltshire+Mental+Health+Partnership+NHS+Trust","/wiki/Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_NHS_Trust","/wiki/Talk:Avon_and_Wiltshire_Mental_Health_Partnership_
