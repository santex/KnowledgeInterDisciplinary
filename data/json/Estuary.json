{"cursor":"22170","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nAn 'estuary' is a partly enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or\nmore rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open\nsea.\n\nEstuaries form a transition zone between river environments and ocean\nenvironments and are subject to both marine influences, such as tides, waves,\nand the influx of saline water; and riverine influences, such as flows of fresh\nwater and sediment. The inflows of both sea water and fresh water provide high\nlevels of nutrients in both the water column and sediment, making estuaries\namong the most productive natural habitats in the world.\n\nMost existing estuaries were formed during the Holocene epoch by the flooding of\nriver-eroded or glacially scoured valleys when the sea level began to rise about\n10,000-12,000 years ago. Estuaries are typically\nclassified by their geomorphological features or by water circulation patterns\nand can be referred to by many different names, such as bays, harbors, lagoons,\ninlets, or sounds, although some of these water bodies do not strictly meet the\nabove definition of an estuary and may be fully saline.\n\nThe banks of many estuaries are amongst the most heavily populated areas of the\nworld, with about 60% of the world's population living along estuaries and the\ncoast. As a result, many estuaries are suffering degradation by many factors,\nincluding sedimentation from soil erosion from deforestation, overgrazing, and\nother poor farming practices; overfishing; drainage and filling of wetlands;\neutrophication due to excessive nutrients from sewage and animal wastes;\npollutants including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, radionuclides and\nhydrocarbons from sewage inputs; and diking or damming for flood control or\nwater diversion.\n","linknr":870,"url":"Estuary","recorded":1362482267,"links":98,"instances":["geology","environmental","ecology","landform","new_hampshire","landform","chemistry","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/others/85_15.pdf","http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/wdb/pub/others/85_15.pdf"],"categories":["Estuaries|","Geodesy","Coastal
