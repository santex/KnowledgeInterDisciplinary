He is\nalso coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages. The 'K' of K&R C and\nthe 'K' in AWK both stand for 'Kernighan'. Brian Kernighan is currently a\nProfessor at the Computer Science Department of Princeton University, where he\nis also the Undergraduate Department Representative.\n\nKernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on\nthe C programming language with Dennis Ritchie. Kernighan has said that he had\nno part in the design of the C language (\"it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's\nwork\").<ref name=\"LJ 2003\"></ref> He authored many Unix programs, including\nditroff, and cron for Version 7 Unix.\n\nIn collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known heuristics for two NP-\ncomplete optimization problems: graph partitioning and the travelling salesman\nproblem. (In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the\n[[Kernighan–Lin]] algorithm, while the latter is styled [[Lin–Kernighan]].)\n\nKernighan was the software editor for Prentice Hall International. His \"Software\nTools\" series spread the essence of 'C/Unix thinking' with makeovers for BASIC,\nFORTRAN, and Pascal - and most notably his 'Ratfor' (rational FORTRAN) was put\nin the public domain.\n\nHe has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it\nwould have to be C.<ref></ref>\n\nKernighan coined the term Unix in the 1970s. The original term he coined was\nUnics (for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, a play on Multics),\nwhich was later changed to Unix. Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the\nexpression \"'What You See Is All You Get (WYSIAYG)'\", which is a sarcastic\nvariant of the original \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG). Kernighan's\nterm is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a\ndocument that could be useful in other contexts.\n","title":"Brian%20Kernighan","headings":["Early life and education","Summary of achievements","Writings","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Unix","4: Princeton_University","4: Dennis_Ritchie","4: Rob_Pike","3: Toronto","3: Canada","3: AMPL","3: Ratfor","3: Troff","3: PJ_Plauger","2: University_of_Toronto","2: Ditroff","2: Al_Aho","2: Peter_J._Weinberger","1: Canadian","1: Computer_Science","1: AWK","1: Computer_scientist","1: Bell_Labs","1: Programming_language","1: Cron","1: Version_7_Unix","1: Heuristics","1: NP-complete","1: Graph_partitioning","1: Travelling_salesman_problem","1: Prentice_Hall","1: BASIC","1: FORTRAN","1: Multics","1: WYSIWYG","1: Bachelor's_degree","1: Engineering_Physics","1: Electrical_engineering","1: P._J._Plauger","1: Pic_language","1: Eqn","1: Lorinda_Cherry","1: Niklaus_Wirth","1: Dennis_M._Ritchie","1: Robert_Fourer"]}
