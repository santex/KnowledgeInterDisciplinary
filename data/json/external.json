The costs of the\n air pollution for the rest of society is not compensated for by either the\n producers or users of motorized transport.]]\n\nIn economics, an 'externality' is a cost or benefit which results from an\nactivity or transaction and which affects an otherwise uninvolved party who did\nnot choose to incur that cost or benefit. <ref></ref>\n\nFor example, manufacturing activities which cause air pollution impose health\nand clean-up costs on the whole society, while the neighbors of an individual\nwho chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire\nspreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the\nproducer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if he\nwere required to pay all associated environmental costs. If there are external\nbenefits, such as in public safety, less of the good may be produced than would\nbe the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to\nothers. For the purposes of these statements, overall cost and benefit to\nsociety is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and\ncosts to all parties involved.<ref>J.J.
