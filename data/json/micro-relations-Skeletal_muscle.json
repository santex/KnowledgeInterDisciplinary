It is one of three major muscle types, the others being\ncardiac and smooth muscle. As their name suggests, most skeletal muscles are\nattached to bones by bundles of collagen fibers known as tendons.\n\nSkeletal muscle is made up of individual components known as myocytes, or\n\"muscle cells\", sometimes colloquially called \"muscle fibers\". They are formed\nfrom the fusion of developmental myoblasts (a type of embryonic progenitor cell\nthat gives rise to a muscle cell). These long, cylindrical, multinucleated cells\nare also called myofibers.\n\nThe myofibers are in turn composed of myofibrils. The myofibrils are composed of\nactin and myosin filaments repeated as a sarcomere, the basic functional unit of\nthe muscle fiber and responsible for skeletal muscle's striated appearance and\nforming the basic machinery necessary for muscle contraction. The term muscle\nrefers to multiple bundles of muscle fibers held together by connective tissue.\n","linknr":428,"url":"Skeletal_muscle","recorded":1362484977,"links":50,"instances":["geometry","anatomy","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Muscular system","Somatic motor system","Muscle tissue"],"headings":["Muscle fibers","Cellular physiology and contraction","Physics","Signal transduction pathways","Research","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Skeletal_muscle.jpg/250px-Skeletal_muscle.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Muscle_pathways.svg/400px-Muscle_pathways.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cylinder","geometry"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["triad","anatomy"]],"members":["cylinder","triad","fermentation"],"related":["Striated_muscle","Somatic_nervous_system","Cardiac_muscle","Smooth_muscle","Collagen","Tendons","Myocyte","Myoblasts","Cylinder_(geometry)","Multinucleate","Myofibers","Myofibrils","Actin","Myosin","Filaments","Sarcomere","Muscle_contraction","Cytoskeleton","Myosin","Actin","Sarcomere","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Myoglobin","Oxidative_metabolism","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Triglyceride","Phosphocreatine","Glycogen","MYH7","MYH2","MYH1","Myosin","Postural_muscles","Sarcolemma","Sarcoplasm","Myofibrils","Sarcoplasmic_reticulum","Terminal_cisternae","T_tubule","Triad_(anatomy)","Tricep","Bicep","Pectoralis_muscles","Rectus_femoris","Orbicularis_oris","Actin","Myosin","Sarcomere","Troponin","Tropomyosin","Depolarization","Acetylcholine","Neuromuscular_junction","Motor_neurons","Sarcoplasmic_reticulum","Calcium","Physiologic_cross-sectional_area","Tensor_tympani_muscle","PPARGC1A","Electrical_muscle_stimulation","In_vitro_muscle_testing","Hill's_muscle_model","In_vitro_muscle_testing","Myopathy","Muscle_atrophy","Musculoskeletal_injury"]}
