Descriptions of the\napparition of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or\nbarely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions. The deliberate\nattempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as necromancy, or in\nspiritism as a [[sÃ©ance]].\n\nThe belief in manifestations of the spirits of the dead is widespread, dating\nback to animism or ancestor worship in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious\npracticesâfuneral rites, exorcisms, and some practices of spiritualism and\nritual magicâare specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts\nare generally described as solitary essences that haunt particular locations,\nobjects, or people they were associated with in life, though stories of phantom\narmies, ghost trains, phantom ships, and even ghost animals have also been\nrecounted.
