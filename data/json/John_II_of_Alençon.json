He succeeded his father as Duke of AlenÃ§on and Count of Perche as a\nminor in 1415, after the latter's death at the Battle of Agincourt. He is best\nknown as a general in the Last Phase of the Hundred Years' War and for his role\nas a comrade-in-arms of Joan of Arc, who called him '\"le beau duc\"' ('\"the fair\nduke\"'/'\"the gentle duke\"').\n\nHe saw action at the age of fifteen at the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424,\nand was captured by the English. He was held prisoner until 1429 at Le Crotoy,\npaying 200,000 saluts d'or for his ransom. He sold all he possessed to the\nEnglish, and his fief of FougÃ¨res to the Duke of Brittany. After AlenÃ§on's\ncapture, the Duke of Bedford, regent of Henry VI, took control of his duchy. He\nwould not regain AlenÃ§on until 1449, but remained the titular duke in the eyes\nof the French crown. When he left prison, Jean d'AlenÃ§on was called \"the poorest\nman in France\".\n\nBefore his capture at Verneuil, he had married in 1424, at the Chateau de Blois,\nJeanne of Valois, daughter of Charles, duc d'OrlÃ©ans and Isabella of Valois, but\nshe died in Angers in 1432, having given him no children.\n\nIn April 1429, not long after his release, the duke heard about Joan of Arc, who\nhad come to Charles VII at Chinon, promising to liberate France from the\nEnglish, asking that he send her with an army to lift the Siege of OrlÃ©ans.\nAlenÃ§on came eagerly to Chinon and very quickly became her good friend and most\nprominent supporter among the princes of the blood. He accompanied her to\nOrlÃ©ans, where he became the official commander of the French army there and\nplayed a major role in Joan's decisive victory against the English alongside\nJean de Dunois and La Hire among others. He then joined her in the liberation of\nthe rest of the Loire Valley. He left to fight elsewhere after the end of the\ncampaign in September 1429, preferring to attack the English around his own\ndomains in Normandy. Upon Joan's martyrdom on 30 May 1431, when she was burnt at\nthe stake by the English at Rouen, AlenÃ§on was one of the people most devastated\nby the loss.\n\nOn 30 April 1437, at the Chateau L'Isle-Jourdain, he married Marie of Armagnac\n(c. 1420 – 25 July 1473, Cloister Mortagne-au-Perche), daughter of Jean IV\nof Armagnac.\n\nJohn was discontented with the Treaty of Arras, having hoped to make good his\npoverty through the spoliation of the Burgundians. He fell out with Charles VII,\nand took part in a revolt in 1439–40, (the Praguerie) but was forgiven,\nhaving been a lifelong friend of the king. He took part in the invasion of\nNormandy in 1449, but he had unwisely entered into correspondence with the\nEnglish since 1440. (He had also accepted the Order of the Golden Fleece at this\ntime.) Shortly after testifying at the \"rehabilitation trial\" of Joan of Arc in\n1456, he was arrested by Jean de Dunois and imprisoned at Aigues-Mortes. In\n1458, he was convicted of lÃ¨se-majestÃ© and sentenced to death, but the sentence\nwas commuted and he was imprisoned at Loches. He was released by Louis XI upon\nterms at his accession in 1461, but he refused to keep them and was imprisoned\nagain. He was tried a second time before the Parlement of Paris and sentenced to\ndeath again on 18 July 1474, and his Duchy was confiscated. However, the\nsentence was not carried out, and he died in prison in the Louvre in 1476.\n\nHe had two children by his second wife, Marie:\n* Catherine (1452–1505), married 1461 in Tours FranÃ§ois Guy XIV de\n  Montmorency, Count of Laval (d. 1500)\n* RenÃ© of AlenÃ§on (1454–1492), who would regain his father's confiscated\n  titles of Duke of AlenÃ§on and Count of Perche in 1478\n\nHe also had several illegitimate children:\n* John (living 1483)\n* Robert (living 1489)\n* Jeanne (d. aft. 4 December 1481), Countess of Beaumont-le-Roger, married in\n  1470 Guy de Maulmont\n* Madeleine, married Henri de Breuil\n","linknr":213,"url":"John_II_of_Alençon","recorded":1375084890,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jean_II,_Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jean_II,_Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Jean_II,_Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=John_II_of_Alen%C3%A7on&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jean_II,_Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Alen%C3%A7on_Arms.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Alen%C3%A7on_Arms.svg/125px-Alen%C3%A7on_Arms.svg.png","/wiki/Counts_and_dukes_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/House_of_Valois","/wiki/Jeanne_of_Valois_(1409-1432)","/wiki/Marriage","/wiki/Widower","/wiki/Marie_of_Armagnac","/wiki/Marriage","/wiki/Widower","/wiki/Nobility","/wiki/House_of_Valois","/wiki/John_I_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Argentan","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/File:Blason_ville_fr_Chambellay_(Maine-et-Loire).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Blason_ville_fr_Chambellay_%28Maine-et-Loire%29.svg/125px-Blason_ville_fr_Chambellay_%28Maine-et-Loire%29.svg.png","/wiki/File:Blason_ville_fr_Chambellay_(Maine-et-Loire).svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Argentan","/wiki/John_I_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/w/index.php?title=Marie_of_Brittany,_Lady_of_La_Guerche&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_V,_Duke_of_Brittany","/wiki/Joan_of_Navarre,_Queen_of_England","/wiki/Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Count_of_Perche","/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt","/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War","/wiki/Joan_of_Arc","/wiki/Battle_of_Verneuil","/wiki/Le_Crotoy","/wiki/Foug%C3%A8res","/wiki/John_IV,_Duke_of_Brittany","/wiki/John_of_Lancaster,_1st_Duke_of_Bedford","/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England","/wiki/Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Chateau_de_Blois","/wiki/Jeanne_of_Valois_(1409-1432)","/wiki/Charles,_duc_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans","/wiki/Isabella_of_Valois","/wiki/Angers","/wiki/Joan_of_Arc","/wiki/Charles_VII_of_France","/wiki/Chinon","/wiki/Kingdom_of_France","/wiki/Siege_of_Orl%C3%A9ans","/wiki/Orl%C3%A9ans","/wiki/Jean_de_Dunois","/wiki/La_Hire","/wiki/Loire_Valley","/wiki/Normandy","/wiki/Martyrdom","/wiki/Burnt_at_the_stake","/wiki/Rouen","/wiki/L%27Isle-Jourdain","/wiki/Marie_of_Armagnac","/wiki/Mortagne-au-Perche","/wiki/Jean_IV_of_Armagnac","/wiki/Treaty_of_Arras_(1435)","/wiki/Charles_VII_of_France","/wiki/Praguerie","/wiki/Order_of_the_Golden_Fleece","/wiki/Jean_de_Dunois","/wiki/Aigues-Mortes","/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9","/wiki/Loches","/wiki/Louis_XI_of_France","/wiki/Parlement_of_Paris","/wiki/Louvre","/wiki/Tours","/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Count_of_Perche","/wiki/Beaumont-le-Roger","/w/index.php?title=Jean_II,_Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Charles_of_Valois","/wiki/Charles_II_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Marguerite_of_Anjou_and_Maine","/wiki/Peter_II_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Ferdinand_de_la_Cerda_(1275%E2%80%931322)","/wiki/Maria_de_la_Cerda","/wiki/Juana_Nunez_de_Lara","/wiki/John_I,_Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Arthur_II,_Duke_of_Brittany","/wiki/John_IV,_Duke_of_Brittany","/wiki/Yolande_de_Dreux_(1263%E2%80%931330)","/wiki/John_V,_Duke_of_Brittany","/wiki/Louis,_Count_of_Nevers","/wiki/Joanna_of_Flanders","/wiki/Jeanne_of_Rethel","/wiki/Philip_III_of_Navarre","/wiki/Charles_II_of_Navarre","/wiki/Joan_II_of_Navarre","/wiki/Joan_of_Navarre,_Queen_of_England","/wiki/John_II_of_France","/wiki/Joan_of_Valois,_Queen_of_Navarre","/wiki/Bonne_of_Luxembourg","/wiki/John_I_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_of_Alen%C3%A7on","/wiki/Count_of_Perche","/w/index.php?title=Jean_II,_Duke_of_Alen%C3%A7on&action=edit&section=2","http://xenophongroup.com/montjoie/compgns.htm","http://www.futura-dtp.dk/SLAG/Personer/NavneA/AlenconDuc.htm","http://www.maidofheaven.com/joanofarc_alencon.asp","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/7
