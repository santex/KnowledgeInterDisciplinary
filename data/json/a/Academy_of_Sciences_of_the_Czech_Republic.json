'AV ÄR') was\nestablished in 1992 by the Czech National Council as the Czech successor of the\nformer Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. The Academy is the leading non-\nuniversity public research institution in the Czech Republic. It conducts both\nfundamental and strategic applied research.\n\nIt has three scientific divisions, namely the Division of Mathematics, Physics,\nand Earth Sciences, Division of Chemical and Life Sciences, and Division of\nHumanities and Social Sciences. The Academy currently manages a network of sixty\nresearch institutes and five supporting units staffed by a total of 6,400\nemployees, over one half of whom are university-trained researchers and Ph.D.\nscientists.\n\nThe Head Office of the Academy and forty research institutes are located in\nPrague, the remaining institutes being situated throughout the country.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_Czech_Republic","recorded":1362505007,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["National academies of sciences|Czech Republic","National academies of arts and humanities|Czech Republic","Science and technology in the Czech Republic"],"headings":["Institutes of AS CR","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Prague_Academy_Sci.jpg/150px-Prague_Academy_Sci.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_Czech_Republic.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Royal_Czech_Society_of_Sciences","Czechoslovak_Academy_of_Sciences","Jiří_Drahoš","Prague","Czech_Republic","Czech_National_Council","Czechoslovak_Academy_of_Sciences","Czech_Republic","Mathematics","Physics","Earth_science","Chemistry","Life_science","Humanities","Social_Sciences","Ph.D.","Prague","Astronomical_Institute_of_Czech_Academy_of_Sciences","Institute_of_Information_Theory_and_Automation_AS_CR","Institute_of_Atmospheric_Physics_AS_CR","J._Heyrovský_Institute_of_Physical_Chemistry_of_the_AS_CR","Jaroslav_Heyrovský","Institute_of_Chemical_Process_Fundamentals","CERGE-EI","Czech_Language_Institute"]}
