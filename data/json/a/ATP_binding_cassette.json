ABC transporters\nare transmembrane proteins that utilize the energy of adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP) hydrolysis to carry out certain biological processes including\ntranslocation of various substrates across membranes and non-transport-related\nprocesses such as translation of RNA and DNA repair. Goffeau, A.; B. de Hertogh; and P.V.\nBaret. 2004. ABC Transporters. In: Encyclopedia of Biological Chemistry. Vol. 1,\n1â5. They transport a wide variety of substrates across extra- and\nintracellular membranes, including metabolic products, lipids and sterols, and\ndrugs. Proteins are classified as ABC transporters based on the sequence and\norganization of their 'ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domain(s)'. ABC transporters\nare involved in tumor resistance, cystic fibrosis and a range of other inherited\nhuman diseases along with both bacterial (prokaryotic) and eukaryotic (including\nhuman) development of resistance to multiple drugs.\n","linknr":1167,"url":"ATP_binding_cassette","recorded":1362486609,"links":30,"instances":["biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["ABC transporters","Protein families"],"headings":["Function","Structure","Mechanism of transport","ABC importers","ABC exporters","Role in multidrug resistance","Reversal of multidrug resistance","Physiological role","Methods to characterize ABC transporter interactions","Subfamilies","Images","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/1l7v_opm.gif/220px-1l7v_opm.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/3b60.gif/220px-3b60.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/2onk.gif/220px-2onk.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Btucd.jpg/300px-Btucd.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/Abc-sav.jpg/300px-Abc-sav.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Abc_domain.jpg/400px-Abc_domain.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d1/Abc_importer.jpg/400px-Abc_importer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Msba.jpg/400px-Msba.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/Abc_exporter.jpg/400px-Abc_exporter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biochemistry"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["substrate","polymorphism"],"related":["Protein","Extant_taxon","Phylum","Prokaryote","Transmembrane_protein","Adenosine_triphosphate","Cell_membrane","Metabolism","Lipid","Sterol","Medication","Cystic_fibrosis","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Cell_membrane","Nutrient","Ion","Amino_acid","Peptide","Sugar","Hydrophilic","Lipid_bilayer","Eukaryotes","Gram-negative_bacteria","Polysaccharide","Cytoplasm","Periplasm","Virulence","Pathogens","Siderophores","Enterobactin","Erythrocytes","Gene","Glucose","Galactose","Osmosis","Lipopolysaccharides","Teichoic_acid","Hemolysis","Heme","Protease","Hydrolytic_enzymes","Toxins","Antibiotics","Bacteriocins","Antibiotics","Cytochrome","Cystic_fibrosis","Cystic_fibrosis_transmembrane_conductance_regulator","Sulfonylurea","Polymorphism_(biology)","Mendelian","Adrenoleukodystrophy","Stargardt_disease","Tangier_disease","Cholestasis","Dubin-Johnson_syndrome","Pseudoxanthoma_elasticum","Hyperinsulinemic_hypoglycemia","Hyperplasia","Sideroblastic_anemia","Macular_degeneration","Corneal_dystrophy","Multiple_drug_resistance","P-glycoprotein","Aldosterone","Dendritic","Platelet_activating_factor","Cortisol","Dexamethasone","Progesterone","Cholesterol","Phosphatidylcholine","Phosphatidylethanolamine","Phosphatidylserine","Sphingomyelin","Glucosylceramide","Placenta","Xenobiotic","Alpha_helices","Macrolide","Vitamin_B12","Homodimer","Monomers","Molybdate","RecA","ATPases","Hydrolysis","Histidine","Catalysis","Lysine","Serine","Amide","Glycine","Aspartate","Glutamate","Glutamine","Active_transport","Phosphate","Adenosine_diphosphate","Vinblastine","Permease","P-glycoprotein","Spectroscopy","Protease","Crosslinking","Gram-negative_bacteria","Gram-positive","Periplasm","Lipoprotein","Cell_membrane","X-ray_crystallography","Molybdenum","Maltose","Transition_state","ATPase","Toxins","Hydrolase","Lantibiotics","Bacteriocins","Antibiotics","Anticancer_agents","Hemolysin","P-glycoprotein","Multi-drug_resistant","Electron_crystallography","Doxorubicin","Vinblastine","Flippase","ATPase","Lipid_A","Lipopolysaccharide","Endotoxin","Mutations","Cross-linking","EPR_spectroscopy","Fluorescence","Multidrug_resistance","P-glycoprotein","Prokaryotic","Eukaryotic","RNAi","Drug_interaction","ATPase_assay","ABCB11","Calcein","ABCA12","ABCA1","ABCB5","Cystic_fibrosis","ABCC6","Peroxisome","ABCD1","ABCF1","ABCF2","ABCG2","ABCG1","Transmembrane_domain_of_ABC_transporters","ATP-binding_domain_of_ABC_transporters","TCDB","ABCdb"]}
