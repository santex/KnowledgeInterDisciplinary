In\nsome of its facets, anatomy is closely related to embryology, comparative\nanatomy and comparative embryology,<ref name=\"intro HGray\"></ref> through common\nroots in evolution. Human anatomy is important in medicine.\n\nThe discipline of anatomy is subdivided into gross or macroscopic anatomy, and\nmicroscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures that can, when\nsuitably presented or dissected, be seen by unaided vision with the naked eye.\nMicroscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including\nhistology (the study of tissues) and cytology (the study of cells).\n\nThe history of anatomy is characterized by a continual development in\nunderstanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body.\nMethods have also improved dramatically, advancing from examination of animals\nthrough dissection of cadavers (dead human bodies) to 20th century techniques\nincluding X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n",
