(May 15, 1905 â October 28, 2002) was a Bengali\nauthor.\n\nHe graduated in English from Ravenshaw College. His father had shifted base from\ntheir ancestral village of Rameswarpur near Dhamnagar in Bhadrak of Orissa,\nfollowing a family feud. His family roots go back to the 'Ghosh Mahashayas' who\nmigrated to Rameswarpur from Kotarang near Howrah as a part of Todarmal's\ncontingent during Akbar's reign.\n\nHe topped the list of Indian Civil Service examinees in 1927. He had failed to\nmake the mark in the previous year, being cut off by one rank. It is said that\nhe promised to his family and friends that if only one person was to be selected\nfor ICS the next year, it would be himself, and he proved it. Incidentally, he\nwas the first ICS officer from the territory later forming the state of Orissa.\n\nAfter serving in various administrative posts, he sought voluntary retirement in\n1951 to devote himself to literary pursuits. Ray was a Gandhian in politics and\nRabindranath Tagore inspired his literature\n\nA Bengali rendering of a short story by Tolstoy and an appraisal of Sarat\nChandra Chattopadhyayâs essay \"Narir Mulya\" marked his debut on the literary\nscene at the age of 16.\n\nHis first published book was Tarunya (1928), which gave him a footing as an\nessayist. His first two novels were Asamapika and Agun Niye Khela. As an\nessayist, he was urbane and sophisticated and combined in his craft two\ndifferent styles of prose, represented by Tagore and Pramatha Choudhury.\n\nA significant breakthrough in his literary career came with the publication of\nPathe Prabase, a diary of his Europe trip, in 1931.\n\nRay also established himself as a short-story writer. His collections include\nPrakritir Parihas (1934), Man Pavan (1946), Kamini Kanchan (1954) and Katha.\n\nHe received the Vidyasagar Smriti Award from the state government and the Padma\nBhushan. He was made a fellow of the Sahitya Akademi in 1989. The Visva Bharati\nconferred on him the Desikottama and an honorary D.Litt. He also received the\nRabindra Puraskar, the Ananda Puraskar twice and the Zaibunnisa Award of\nBangladesh.\n\nHe was a bitter opponent of the partition of 1947 and wrote several Bengali\npoems criticising it. Most notable is \"Teler shishi bhaanglo bole khukur pare\nraag karo\". Among his many essays, the book \"Banglar Reneissance\" has an\nanalytical history of the cultural and social revolution in Bengal. His married\nLeela Ray, an Indianized American lady with literary talent. Annada Shankar's\nmost famous work is Pathe Prabaase, a diary of his Europe trip in 1931.\n\nFrom amongst his other works in Oriya, the poetry \"Sabita\" finds place in higher\nstudies of the language at college level, making him one of the rare poets to\nhave the distinction of getting such acclaim from two different language\nspeaking states of India.\n\nHe died in Kolkata on 28 October 2002.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Annadashankar_Roy","recorded":1374859525,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Annada_Shankar_Ray","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Annadashankar_Roy&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Annada_Shankar_Ray","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Wikipedia:When_to_cite","/wiki/File:Annada.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/60/Annada.jpg","/wiki/File:Annada.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Orissa","/wiki/India","/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify","/wiki/Bengali_people","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Ravenshaw_College","/wiki/Rameswarpur","/wiki/Rameswarpur","/wiki/Indian_Civil_Service","/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words","/wiki/Padma_Bhushan","/wiki/Sahitya_Akademi","/wiki/Visva_Bharati","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#Life","#Works","#Novels","#Essays","#Autobiography","#Short_story_collections","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Ravenshaw_College","/wiki/Cuttack","/wiki/Orissa","/wiki/Oriya_Literature","/wiki/Oriya_Literature","/wiki/Oriya_Literature","/wiki/Bengali_Language","/wiki/Indian_Civil_Service","/wiki/Pianist","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Bengali_Literature","/wiki/Bangladesh","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-1","http://www.southasianmedia.net/profile/Bangladesh/bangladesh_lp_literature.cfm#18h","/wiki/Bangladesh","/wiki/University_of_Dhaka","/wiki/Bangladesh","/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&action=edit&section=8","http://www.calcuttaweb.com/cgi-bin/picdispgeneral.pl?/kabita/teler_sisi.gif","http://www.telegraphindia.com/1021029/asp/bengal/story_1334876.asp","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/39391009","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annada_Shankar_Ray&oldid=542452531","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1904_births","/wiki/Category:2002_deaths","/wiki/Category:Bengali_bureaucrats","/wiki/Category:Indian_Civil_Service_officers","/wiki/Category:Indian_poets","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Padma_Bhushan","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Ananda_Purashkar","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Sahitya_Akademi_Fellowship","/wiki/Category:Bengali_writers","/wiki/Category:Bengali-language_writers","/wiki/Category:Bengali_poets","/wiki/Category:Bengali-language_poets","/wiki/Category:Oriya_literature","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Sahitya_Akademi_Award_in_Bengali","/wiki/Category:Recipients_of_the_Rabindra_Puraskar","/wiki/Category:People_associated_with_the_Bengal_Renaissance","/wiki/Category:People_from_Dhenkanal","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_cleanup_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Cleanup_tagged_articles_with_a_reason_field_from_April_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_pages_needi
