{"cursor":"3030","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'ancestor' or ' forebear' is a parent or (recursively) the parent of an\nancestor (i.e., a grandparent, great-grandparent, great-great-grandparent, and\nso forth). Ancestor is \"any person from whom one is descended. In law the person\nfrom whom an estate has been inherited.\"\n\nTwo individuals have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other,\nor if they share a common ancestor. In evolutionary theory, species which share\nan evolutionary ancestor are said to be of common descent. However, this concept\nof ancestry does not apply to some bacteria and other organisms capable of\nhorizontal gene transfer.\n\nAssuming that all of an individual's ancestors are otherwise unrelated to each\nother, that individual has 2 n ancestors in the nth generation before\nhim and a total of about 2 g+1 ancestors in the g generations before\nhim. In practice, however, it is clear that the vast majority of ancestors of\nhumans (and indeed any other species) are multiply related (see Pedigree\ncollapse). Consider n = 40: the human species is more than 40 generations old,\nyet the number 2 40 , approximately 10 12 or one trillion,\ndwarfs the number of humans that have ever lived.\n\nIgnoring the possibility of other inter-relationships (even distant ones) among\nancestors, an individual has a total of 2046 ancestors up to the 10th\ngeneration, 1024 of which are 10th generation ancestors. With the same\nassumption, any given person has over a billion 30th generation ancestors (who\nlived roughly 1000 years ago) and this theoretical number increases past the\nestimated total population of the world in around AD 1000. (All of these\nancestors will have contributed to one's autosomal DNA is concerned: this\nexcludes Y-chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA.)\n\nSome cultures confer reverence to ancestors, both living and dead; in contrast,\nsome more youth-oriented cultural contexts display less veneration of elders. In\nother cultural contexts, some people seek providence from their deceased\nancestors; this practice is sometimes known as [[ancestor worship]] or, more\naccurately, [[ancestor veneration]].\n","linknr":192,"url":"ancestor","recorded":1362582178,"links":41,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Kinship and descent"],"headings":["See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Parent","Recursion","Grandparent","Great-grandparent","Genetics","Evolution","Common_descent","Bacteria","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Pedigree_collapse","DNA","Y-Chromosome","Ethnicity","Family_relationship","Most_recent_common_ancestor"]}
