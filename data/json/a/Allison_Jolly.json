Jolly began sailing at the age of 10 and attended the Florida State\nUniversity where she won the National Collegiate sailing championships in 1975\nand 1976. In 1976 she placed second in the European women's championship, and\nalso took second place in the Timmy Angsten Regatta. In 1977, at the age of 20,\nshe became the youngest woman ever to win the Yachtswoman of the Year Award from\nthe New York Yacht Club, \"considered the top prize in yachting.\"\n\nAfter college, Jolly worked as a computer programmer in Valencia, California to\nsupport her sailing. She bought her first boat with $8,000 that she and her\nhusband had saved for a down payment on a house. Her husband, Mark\nElliot, also worked as a computer programmer and raced as a sailor.\n\nIn 1987, Jolly and her sailing partner Lynne Jewell entered the Olympic trials\nfor the 1988 Summer Olympics. Despite a poor start in the qualifiers, the two\nrose to the top and won a spot. After qualifying, Jolly was\n\"considered a long shot\" in the event. In the first race of the\ngames, Jolly and Jewell placed third, and in the next race, their\nboat capsized twice, but the two managed to stay in contention. After\nfinishing strong in their remaining races, the two won the gold medal in the\n[[470 (dinghy)|470 Class]] with a convincing lead over the competition, causing\nthe Washington Post to write that they \"blew the competition out of the\nwater.\" [http://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=22&sp=YAT 1988\nSummer Olympics – Seoul, South Korea – Sailing] –\ndatabaseOlympics.com (Retrieved on May 25, 2008) Jolly and Jewel were the\nonly American sailors, male or female, to win a gold medal in the games. Their\nvictory helped to promote the involvement of more women in sailing\ncompetitions.\n\nImmediately after returning from the Olympics, Jolly continued sailing, entering\nthe US Yacht Racing Union's Championship of Champions with her husband only\nthree days later. In the Championship of Champions, Jolly raced a Snipe instead\nof the 470 she had raced in the Olympics and had a difficult time adjusting to\nthe boat differences. As a result, she and Elliot placed ninth. In 1994, Jolly applied to join the first-ever all female team in the\nAmerica's Cup yachting race, organized by Bill Koch. In a decision\nthat shocked the yachting world, Jolly was cut from the team after tryouts and\ntraining, as was Lynne Jewell.\n\nJolly continues her sailing passion working at the University of South Florida\nSt. Petersburg Campus as a sailing coach for the Women's Varsity\nteam.
