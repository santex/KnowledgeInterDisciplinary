It is a response to global (Eurocentric/Orientalist) racist attitudes\nabout African people and their historical contributions and revisits their\nhistory with an African cultural and ideological focus.

ISBN 0-19-517055-5\n\nAfrocentrism can be seen as an African-American inspired ideology that manifests\nan affirmation of themselves in a Eurocentric-dominated society, commonly by\nconceptualizing a glorified heritage in terms of distinctly African, foreign\norigins (where foreign is anything not indigenous to Sub-Saharan Africa). It\noften denies or minimizes European cultural influences while accenting\nhistorical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant\nlevel of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is\nusually manifested in a focus on African-American culture and the history of\nAfrica, and involves an African Diaspora version of an African-centered view of\nhistory and culture to portray the achievements and development of Africans who\nhave been marginalized by other races of people (usually Arabs and whites).\n\nWhat is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-\nAmerican intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but\nflowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American\nintellectuals in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development of African-\nAmerican Studies programs in universities. In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a\ndistinct academic ideology, reached its peak in the 80's and 90's. [http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.-\nhtm Wilson J.
