Antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter in the same\nway that normal particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron\n(the antiparticle of the electron, with symbol ) and an antiproton (symbol ) can\nform an antihydrogen atom. Furthermore, mixing matter and antimatter can lead to\nthe annihilation of both, in the same way that mixing antiparticles and\nparticles does, thus giving rise to high-energy photons (gamma rays) or other\nparticleâantiparticle pairs. The end result of antimatter meeting matter is a\nrelease of energy proportional to the mass as the mass-energy equivalence\nequation, E=mc 2 shows. http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-\nantimatter-110811.html\n\nThere is considerable speculation as to why the observable universe is\napparently composed almost entirely of matter (as opposed to a mixture of matter\nand antimatter), whether there exist other places that are almost entirely\ncomposed of antimatter instead, and what sorts of technology might be possible\nif antimatter could be harnessed. At this time, the apparent asymmetry of matter\nand antimatter in the visible universe is one of the greatest unsolved problems\nin physics.
