{"cursor":"5032","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Artificial Creation' is a field of research that studies the primary synthesis\nof complex lifelike structures from primordial lifeless origins.\n\nThe field bears some similarity to artificial life, but unlike artificial life,\nartificial creation focuses on the primary emergence of complex structures.\nArtificial creation does not rely exclusively on the application of evolutionary\ncomputation and genetic algorithms to optimize artificial creatures or grow\nsynthetic life forms. Artificial creation instead studies systems of rules of\ninteraction, initial conditions and primordial building blocks that can generate\ncomplex lifelike structures, based exclusively on repeated application of rules\nof interaction.\n\nAn essential difference that distinguishes artificial creation from other\nrelated fields is that no explicit fitness function is used to select for fit\nstructures. Structures exist based only on their ability to persist as entities\nthat do not violate the system's rules of interaction. Artificial creation\nstudies the way in which complex emergent properties can arise to form a self-\norganizing system.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Artificial_creation","recorded":1362673576,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Artificial life","Simulation software"],"headings":["Origins","Issues","References","Conferences"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Artificial_life","Evolutionary_computation","Genetic_algorithms","Fitness_function","Emergent_properties","Self-organizing_system","Biology","Computer_science","Mathematics","Engineering","Artificial_life","Evolutionary_computing","Evolution","Fitness_functions","Self-replication","Self-organizing_systems","Fitness_function","Objective_function","Artificial_life","Fitness_function","Artificial_evolution","Synthetic_organisms","Fitness_functions","Evolution","Evolution","Optimize","Stochastic","Artificial_organisms","Fitness_functions","Evolutionary_biology","Ecosystems","Emergent_properties","Artificial_life","Emergent_properties"]}
