They are also referred to as\n'hydrophytes' or '[[macrophytes]]'. These plants require special adaptations\nfor living submerged in water, or at the water's surface - the most common\nadaptation is aerenchyma, but floating leaves and finely dissected leaves are\nalso common.

Aquatic plants can only grow\nin water or in soil that is permanently saturated with water. They are\ntherefore a common component of wetlands. Keddy, P.A. 2010.

However, other factors may also control\ntheir distribution and abundance, including nutrients, disturbance from\nwaves, grazing, and salinity. Keddy, P.A. 2010.

Seaweeds are not\nvascular plants; rather they are multicellular marine algae, and therefore are\nnot typically included among aquatic plants. A few aquatic plants are able to\nsurvive in brackish, saline, and salt water. Sculthorpe, C. D. 1967. The\nBiology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by\nLondon. Examples are found in genera such as Thalassia and Zostera.\nAlthough most aquatic plants can reproduce by flowering and setting seed, many\nalso have extensive asexual reproduction by means of rhizomes, turions, and\nfragments in general.

New York: John Wiley.\n\nOne of the largest aquatic plants in the world is the Amazon water lily; one\nof the smallest is the minute duckweed. Many small aquatic animals use plants\nlike duckweed for a home, or for protection from predators. But areas with\nmore vegetation are likely to have more predators. Some other familiar\nexamples of aquatic plants might include floating heart, water lily, lotus and\nwater hyacinth.\n\nSome aquatic plants are used by humans as a food source. Examples include wild\nrice ([[Zizania (genus)|Zizania]]), water caltrop ([[Trapa natans]]), Chinese\nwater chestnut ([[Eleocharis dulcis]]), Indian lotus ([[Nelumbo nucifera]]),\nwater spinach ([[Ipomoea aquatica]]) and watercress ([[Rorippa nasturtium-\naquaticum]])\n","linknr":348,"url":"Aquatic_plant","recorded":1362371823,"links":54,"instances":["genus"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aquatic plants|"],"headings":["Morphological Classification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Nymphaea_alba.jpg/220px-Nymphaea_alba.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/FloatingRedBlueLilies.JPG/170px-FloatingRedBlueLilies.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["thalassia","genus"]],"members":["thalassia"],"related":["Water","Aerenchyma","Soil","Vascular_plant","Fern","Angiosperms","Monocot","Dicot","Seaweed","Ocean","Algae","Saline_water","Thalassia_(genus)","Zostera","Victoria_amazonica","Duckweed","Floating_heart","Nymphaeaceae","Nelumbo","Water_hyacinth","Isoetid","Helophyte","Pleuston","Marsh","Seagrass","Wetland"]}
