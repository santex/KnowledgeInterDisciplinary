They are also used to protect friendly surface\ncombatants and missile submarines.<ref></ref> Some attack subs are also armed\nwith cruise missiles mounted in vertical launch tubes, increasing the scope of\ntheir potential missions to include land targets.\n\nAttack submarines may be either nuclear-powered or diesel-electric\n(\"conventionally\") powered. In the United States Navy naming system, nuclear-\npowered attack submarines are known as SSNs and their diesel-electric\npredecessors were SSKs.\n",
