When applied to meters, the terms \"perfect\"\nand \"imperfect\" are sometimes used as the equivalents of \"divisive\" and\n\"additive\", respectively (Read 1964, ).\n\nFor example, 4 may be evenly divided by 2 (4/2 = 2) or reached through\nrepeatedly adding 2 (2 + 2 = 4), while 5 is only evenly\ndivisible by 5 and 1 (5/2 = 2.5; 5/3 = 1.66) and may be\nreached by repeatedly adding 1 or 5 (2 + 2 = 4,\n4 + 2 = 6; 3 + 3 = 6); thus 4/8 is\ndivisive while 5/8 is additive.\n\nThe terms additive and divisive originate with Curt Sachs's book Rhythm and\nTempo (1953) (Agawu 2003, 86), while the term akshak rhythm was introduced for\nthe former concept at about the same time by Constantin BrÄiloiu (1951), in\nagreement with the Turkish musicologist Ahmed Adnan Saygun (Fracile 2003, 198).\nThe relationship between additive and divisive rhythms is complex, and the terms\nare often used in imprecise ways. Justin London states in his article on rhythm\nin the second edition of the [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]\nthat \"In discussions of rhythmic notation, practice or style, few terms are as\nconfusing or used as confusedly as âadditiveâ and âdivisiveâ. â¦ These confusions\nstem from two misapprehensions. The first is a failure to distinguish between\nsystems of notation (which may have both additive and divisive aspects) and the\nmusic notated under such a system. The second involves a failure to understand\nthe divisive and additive aspects of metre itself\" (London 2001, Â§I.8). Winold\nrecommends that, \"metric structure is best described through detailed analysis\nof pulse groupings on various levels rather than through attempts to represent\nthe organization with a single term\" (Winold 1975, 217)\n\nSub-Saharan African music and most European (Western) music is divisive, while\nIndian and other Asian musics may be considered as primarily additive. However,\nmany pieces of music cannot be clearly labeled divisive or additive.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Additive_rhythm","recorded":1362902621,"links":25,"instances":["music","music","music","music","music","professor_of_music","rhythm"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rhythm"],"headings":["Divisive rhythm","Additive rhythm","Sub-Saharan African rhythm","Tresillo: divisive and additive interpretations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Additive_and_divisive_meters.png/250px-Additive_and_divisive_meters.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Divisive_rhythm.png/300px-Divisive_rhythm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Additive_rhythm.png/300px-Additive_rhythm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Tresillo_additive.png/200px-Tresillo_additive.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Tresillo_divisive.png/200px-Tresillo_divisive.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["meter","music"],["metre","music"],["bar","music"],["beat","music"],["tresillo","rhythm"],["counting","music"],["john_tyrrell","professor_of_music"]],"members":["bar","beat","meter","counting","metre","john_tyrrell","tresillo"],"related":["Music","Rhythm","Meter_(music)","Rhythm","Rhythmic_unit","Concatenation","Ahmed_Adnan_Saygun","Metric_structure","Pulse_group","Music_of_India","Time_signature","Metre_(music)","Time_signature","Bar_(music)","Quaver","Beat_(music)","Crotchet","Béla_Bartók","Philip_Glass","Minimalism","Cross-rhythm","Tresillo_(rhythm)","Morocco","Indonesia","Moroccan_music","Mali","Islam","Music_of_Africa","African_diaspora","Counting_(music)","Stanley_Sadie","John_Tyrrell_(professor_of_music)"]}
