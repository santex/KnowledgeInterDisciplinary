{"cursor":"5858","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Anti-fog' agents, also known as 'anti-fogging' agents and treatments, are\nchemicals that prevent the condensation of water in the form of small droplets\non a surface which resemble fog. Anti-fog treatments were first developed by\nNASA during Project Gemini, and are now often used on transparent glass or\nplastic surfaces used in optical applications, such as the lenses and mirrors\nfound in glasses, goggles, camera lenses, and binoculars. A-fog treatments work\nby minimizing surface tension, resulting in a non-scattering film of water\ninstead of single droplets, an effect called wetting. Anti-fog treatments\nusually work either by application of a surfactant film, or by creating a\nhydrophilic surface.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Anti-fog","recorded":1362512415,"links":19,"instances":["pharmaceutical","photography","liquid_drop","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fog","Automotive accessories","Glass coating and surface modification","NASA spin-off technologies"],"headings":["Development","Application","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png/20px-Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lens","optics"],["spray","liquid_drop"],["cream","pharmaceutical"],["fogging","photography"]],"members":["cream","fogging","spray","lens"],"related":["Condensation","Water","Droplets","Fog","NASA","Project_Gemini","Glass","Plastic","Optical","Lens_(optics)","Mirror","Glasses","Goggles","Photographic_lens","Binoculars","Surface_tension","Scattering","Film","Water","Wetting","Surfactant","Hydrophilic","NASA","Project_Gemini","Visor","Gemini_9A","Eugene_A._Cernan","Space_suit","Space_walk","Spacecraft_9_life_support_system","Condensation","Spray_(liquid_drop)","Solution","Cream_(pharmaceutical)","Gel","Wet_wipe","Coating","Manufacturing","Exude","Surfactant","Detergent","Shampoo","Soap","Shaving_cream","Hydrophilic","Surface_energy","Polymer","Hydrogel","Gelatin","Colloid","Nanoparticle","Titanium_dioxide","Ultraviolet","Detergent","Water_soluble","White_vinegar","Ammonia","Alcohol","Fog","Fogging_(photography)"]}
