{"cursor":"5455","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Arnold de Lantins' (fl. 1420s – before 2 July 1432) was a\nFranco–Flemish composer of the late medieval and early Renaissance eras.\nHe is one of a few composers who shows aspects of both medieval and Renaissance\nstyle, and was a contemporary of Dufay during Dufay's sojourn in Italy.\n\nVery little is known about his life, except for a few years in the 1420s to\naround 1430. It is presumed that he was from Flanders or adjacent areas. In the\nearly 1420s he was probably in the service of the Malatesta family in either\nRimini or Pesaro, since Dufay mentioned him in the text of a rondeau which was\nwritten between 1420 and 1424. Lantins was in Venice in 1428 and Rome in 1431,\nin the latter city as a singer in the papal chapel choir, along with Dufay. He\nwas only in Rome six months; after that he disappears from history. Rome was\nentering a period of turmoil related to the Conciliar movement after the death,\nin February 1431, of Pope Martin V; many musicians left at that time or shortly\nafter, and Lantins may have been one of them.\n\nIt is not known for certain if Arnold de Lantins was a relative of Hugo de\nLantins, a composer active at the same time, but since their works often appear\ntogether in collections and they seem to have been in the same geographical\nregions, it is not unlikely, however a sharp stylistic difference between the\nworks of the two composers shows they can not be the same person.\n\nLantin's music was held in high regard, and appears alongside that of Dufay,\nGilles Binchois and Johannes Ciconia in contemporary manuscript collections. In\nparticular, one motet — Tota pulchra es — is found in widely\ndistributed sources; since this was before the advent of printing technology,\nwide distribution of copies is taken as evidence of a composer's fame and\npopularity. Arnold wrote a complete mass, found in Bologna Q15 (all the\nmovements are found in OX 213 although the last two movements are separated\n– only the first three movements are found in Bologna 2216), as well as\nseveral parts of a composite mass in Bologna Q15, augmenting movements written\nby Johannes Ciconia. Several other examples exist of composers adding movements\nto partial masses written by other composers, for example Zacara da Teramo,\nparticularly in Bologna Q15. Musically Arnold's mass movements are fairly\nsimple, using three voices, head motif technique, and avoiding imitative\nwriting. Some of his other sacred music, such as his Marian motets, contain\nflorid melodic writing and some use of imitation.\n\nHe also wrote secular music, including ballades and rondeaux, all of which are\nin French, as well as a few shorter sacred pieces. Some of them refer to\nspecific events or specific people, but none of either have been conclusively\nidentified.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Arnold_de_Lantins","recorded":1375077357,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Floruit","/wiki/Dutch_School_(music)","/wiki/Medieval","/wiki/Renaissance","/wiki/Guillaume_Dufay","/wiki/Flanders","/wiki/House_of_Malatesta","/wiki/Rimini","/wiki/Pesaro","/wiki/Rondeau_(poetry)","/wiki/Venice","/wiki/Rome","/wiki/Conciliarism","/wiki/Pope_Martin_V","/wiki/Hugo_de_Lantins","/wiki/Gilles_Binchois","/wiki/Johannes_Ciconia","/wiki/Motet","/wiki/Mass_(music)","/wiki/Johannes_Ciconia","/wiki/Zacara_da_Teramo","/wiki/Head_motif","/wiki/Imitation_(music)","/wiki/Marian_antiphon","/wiki/Ballade_(forme_fixe)","/wiki/Rondeau_(forme_fixe)","/wiki/French_language","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1561591742","/wiki/Gustave_Reese","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0393095304","http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo","/wiki/Alejandro_Planchart","http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo","/w/index.php?title=Lidia_Ku%C4%87mierz&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Capilla_Flamenca","/wiki/Psallentes","/w/index.php?title=Oltremontano&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Johannes_Brassart","/wiki/Johannes_Cesaris","http://www.acc.umu.se/~akadkor/early/IIID_Lantins_Arnold_de.html","http://www.acc.umu.se/~akadkor/indexENG.html","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=edit&section=3","http://www.diamm.ac.uk/","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Arnold_de_Lantins","/wiki/Choral_Public_Domain_Library","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/74039957","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&oldid=541212288","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Medieval_composers","/wiki/Category:Renaissance_composers","/wiki/Category:Burgundian_school_composers","/wiki/Category:Franco-Flemish_composers","/wiki/Category:1432_deaths","/wiki/Category:Pages_containing_links_to_subscription-only_content","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_October_2010","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_unknown","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arnold+de+Lantins&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arnold+de+Lantins","/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins","/wiki/Talk:Arnold_de_Lantins","#","/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Arnold_de_Lantins","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Arnold_de_Lantins","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&oldid=541212288","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1988679","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Arnold_de_Lantins&id=541212288","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Arnold+de+Lantins","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Arnold+de+Lantins&oldid=541212288&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Arnold_de_Lantins&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_de_Lantins","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93_%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A1","//nl.wikipe
