A\ncommon misunderstanding is that x and y represent actual length and height. This\nis false; they actually represent the relation between width and height. As an\nexample, 8:5, 16:10 and 1.6:1 are the same aspect ratio.\n\nIt may be applied to two characteristic dimensions of a three-dimensional shape.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Aspect_ratio","recorded":1362556016,"links":25,"instances":["wing","graphics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ratios"],"headings":["Applications and uses","Examples","Maths and Aspect ratio","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Aspect_ratio_compare.svg/588px-Aspect_ratio_compare.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Elps-slr.svg/500px-Elps-slr.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aspect_ratio","image"],["aspect_ratio","wing"],["wxga","graphics"]],"members":["aspect_ratio","wxga"],"related":["Shape","Aspect_ratio_(image)","Display_aspect_ratio","Paper_size","Standard_photographic_print_sizes","Standard_ad_size","Pixel_aspect_ratio","Photolithography","HARMST","Tire_code","Tire_sizing","Aspect_ratio_(wing)","Aircraft","Bird","Astigmatism","Optical_lens","VGA","XGA","Standard-definition_television","ISO_216","135_film","Widescreen","Computer_display","WXGA_(graphics)","Golden_ratio","Super_16_mm","Film_gauge","Widescreen","Major_axis","Minor_axis","Pixel_dimensions","Digital_image","Ratio","Equidimensional","Vertical_orientation"]}
