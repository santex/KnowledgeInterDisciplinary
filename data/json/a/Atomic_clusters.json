Clusters exist of diverse stoichiometries\nand nuclearities. For example, carbon and boron atoms form fullerene and borane\nclusters, respectively. Transition metals and main group elements form\nespecially robust clusters. Inorganic Chemistry Huheey, JE , 3rd ed. Harper\nand Row, New York\n\nThe phrase cluster was coined by F.A. Cotton in the early 1960s to refer to\ncompounds containing metalâmetal bonds. In another definition a cluster\ncompound contains a group of two or more metal atoms where direct and\nsubstantial metal metal bonding is present. Introduction to cluster\nchemistry by D. M. P. Mingos, David J Wales 1990 ISBN 0-13-479049-9 The\nprefixed terms ânuclearâ and âmetallicâ are used and imply different meanings.\nFor example, polynuclear refers to a cluster with more than one metal atom,\nregardless of the elemental identities. Heteronuclear refers to a cluster with\nat least two different metal elements.\n\nThe main cluster types are \"naked\" clusters (without stabilizing ligands) and\nthose with ligands. For transition metal clusters, typical stabilizing ligands\ninclude carbon monoxide, halides, isocyanides, alkenes, and hydrides. For main\ngroup elements, typical clusters are stabilized by hydride ligands.\n\nTransition metal clusters are frequently composed of refractory metal atoms. In\ngeneral metal centers with extended d-orbitals form stable clusters because of\nfavorable overlap of valence orbitals. Thus, metals with a low oxidation state\nfor the later metals and mid-oxidation states for the early metals tend to form\nstable clusters. Polynuclear metal carbonyls are generally found in late\ntransition metals with low formal oxidation states. The polyhedral skeletal\nelectron pair theory or Wade's electron counting rules predict trends in the\nstability and structures of many metal clusters.Jemmis ''mno'' rules have\nprovided additional insight into the relative stability of metal clusters.\n","linknr":525,"url":"Atomic_clusters","recorded":1362666404,"links":26,"instances":["element","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cluster chemistry"],"headings":["History and classification","Metal clusters in catalysis","Stereodynamics of clusters","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Tetrarhodium-dodecacarbonyl-from-xtal-173K-3D-balls-A.png/200px-Tetrarhodium-dodecacarbonyl-from-xtal-173K-3D-balls-A.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Mo6Cl14-anion-from-xtal-2008-CM-3D-ellipsoids.png/200px-Mo6Cl14-anion-from-xtal-2008-CM-3D-ellipsoids.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Dodecaborane-3D-balls.png/200px-Dodecaborane-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/FdRedox.png/500px-FdRedox.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/DispersionVSclusterSize.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/b/7/bb70ad42bde695a7cdd2f8e2fd6a6043.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["molybdenum(ii_chloride"],["molybdenum(ii_chloride"],["potassium_octachlorodirhenate(iii"],["di-tungsten_tetra(hpp"],["reactivity","chemistry"],["cluster","physics"]],"members":["mercury","cluster","reactivity"],"related":["Chemistry","Atom","Molecule","Solid","Carbon","Boron","Fullerene","Borane","F.A._Cotton","Ligand","Carbon_monoxide","Halide","Isocyanide","Alkene","Hydride","Refractory_metals","D-orbital","Oxidation_state","Metal_carbonyl","Transition_metal","Oxidation_states","Polyhedral_skeletal_electron_pair_theory","Kenneth_Wade","Jemmis_mno_rules","Calomel","India","Mercury_(element)","Condensation","Adsorbtion","Freezing","Phase_space","Configuration_space","Metastability","Diiron_nonacarbonyl","Triiron_dodecacarbonyl","Dimanganese_decacarbonyl","X-ray_diffraction","Linus_Pauling","Molybdenum(II)_chloride","F._Albert_Cotton","Diamagnetic","Paramagnetic","Rhenium","Double_bond","Hydrochloric_acid","Tungsten","Molybdenum(II)_chloride","Molybdenum","Octahedral_cluster","Chevrel_phase","Superconductivity","Potassium_octachlorodirhenate(III)","Quadruple_bond","Di-tungsten_tetra(hpp)","Ionization_energy","Alfred_Stock","Borane","Pentaborane","Decaborane","Carborane","Ferredoxin","Nitrogenase","Bioinorganic_chemistry","Zintl_phase","Ammonia","Ethylenediamine","Cryptate","Square_antiprism","Wade's_rules","Closo_cluster","Oxidation","Potassium","Lead","Tetrachloroauric_acid","Triphenylphosphine","Ethylene_diamine","2.2.2-crypt","Nickel","Icosahedral","Tin","Closed_shell","Photoelectron_spectroscopy","Potassium","Mass_spectrometer","Angstrom","Fullerene","Endohedral_fullerene","Laves_phases","William_Hume-Rothery","Angewandte_Chemie_International_Edition","Mass_spectrometry","Photoelectron_spectroscopy","Infrared_multiphoton_dissociation","Reactivity_(chemistry)","Ionization_potential","HOMO","LUMO","Superatoms","Gold_cluster","Metal_aromaticity","Fullerene","Endohedral_fullerenes","Extended_metal_atom_chains","Ligand","Nickel","Chromium","Cobalt","Oligonucleotide","Pyridine","Quadruple_bond","Iron-sulfur_proteins","Stereochemistry","Isomerization","Citrate","Isocitrate","Aconitate","Tricarboxylic_acid_cycle","Nitrogenase","Carbon_monoxide_dehydrogenase","Hydrogenase","NiFe_clusters","Carbon_monoxide","Triruthenium_dodecacarbonyl","Tetrairidium_dodecacarbonyl","Water_gas_shift_reaction","Iron_oxide","Fischer-Tropsch_process","Heterogeneous_catalyst","Fluxionality","Density_Functional_Theory","Cluster_(physics)","Water_cluster","Metallaprism"]}
