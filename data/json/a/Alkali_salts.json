{"cursor":"1989","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Alkali salts' or 'basic salts' are salts which are the product of the\nneutralization of a strong base and a weak acid.\n\nRather than being neutral, as some salts are, basic salts are, as their name\nsuggests, bases. What makes these compounds basic is that the conjugate base\nfrom the weak acid hydrolyzes to form a basic solution. In sodium carbonate, for\nexample, the carbonate from the carbonic acid hydrolyzes to form a basic\nsolution. The chloride from the hydrochloric acid in sodium chloride does not\nhydrolyze, though, so sodium chloride is not basic.\n\nThe difference between a basic salt and an alkali is that an alkali is the\nsoluble hydroxide compound of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. A\nbasic salt is any salt that hydrolyzes to form a basic solution. The hydroxide\ncompounds are not salts.\n\nAnother definition of a basic salt would be a salt that contains amounts of both\nhydroxide and other anions. White lead is an example. It is basic lead\ncarbonate, or lead carbonate hydroxide.\n\nThese salts are insoluble and are obtained through precipitation reactions.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Alkali_salts","recorded":1362482480,"links":17,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical compounds","Salts"],"headings":["Examples","Alkaline salts","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/35px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base","salt"],"related":["Salt_(chemistry)","Base_(chemistry)","Sodium_carbonate","Carbonate","Carbonic_acid","Hydrolyze","Hydrochloric_acid","Sodium_chloride","White_lead","Precipitation_reactions","Calcium_carbonate","Sodium_carbonate","Sodium_acetate","Potassium_cyanide","Sodium_sulfide","Sodium_metasilicate","Sodium_hydroxide","Sodium_carbonate","Sodium_percarbonate","Sodium_persilicate","Potassium_metabisulphite","Alkali","Acid_salt"]}
