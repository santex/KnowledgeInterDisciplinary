{"cursor":"20493","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n forms of benzene (top) combine to produce an average structure (bottom)]] In\n organic chemistry, 'aromaticity' is a chemical property describing the way in\n which a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs, or empty orbitals\n exhibits a stabilization stronger than would be expected by the stabilization\n of conjugation alone. The earliest use of the term was in an article by August\n Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. There is no general\n relationship between aromaticity as a chemical property and the olfactory\n properties of such compounds.\n\nAromaticity can also be considered a manifestation of cyclic delocalization and\nof resonance. This is usually considered to be\nbecause electrons are free to cycle around circular arrangements of atoms that\nare alternately single- and double-bonded to one another. These bonds may be\nseen as a hybrid of a single bond and a double bond, each bond in the ring\nidentical to every other. This commonly seen model of aromatic rings, namely the\nidea that benzene was formed from a six-membered carbon ring with alternating\nsingle and double bonds (cyclohexatriene), was developed by KekulÃ© (see History\nsection below). The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms, which\ncorresponds to the double and single bonds superimposing to give rise to six one-and-a-\nhalf bonds. Benzene is a more stable molecule than would be expected without\naccounting for charge delocalization.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Aromatic_compounds","recorded":1362902298,"links":49,"instances":["chemistry","organic_chemist","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aromatic compounds|","Physical organic chemistry"],"headings":["Theory","History","Characteristics of aromatic (aryl) compounds","Importance of aromatic compounds","Types of aromatic compounds","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Benzene_resonance_structures.png/220px-Benzene_resonance_structures.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Benzene-6H-delocalized.svg/100px-Benzene-6H-delocalized.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Benzene-orbitals.png/330px-Benzene-orbitals.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Benzene_Orbitals.svg/330px-Benzene_Orbitals.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Historic_Benzene_Formulae_Kekul%C3%A9_%28original%29.png/300px-Historic_Benzene_Formulae_Kekul%C3%A9_%28original%29.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resonance","chemistry"],["resonance","chemistry"],["resonance","chemistry"],["radical","chemistry"],["robert_robinson","organic_chemist"],["chirality","chemistry"],["btx","chemistry"]],"members":["btx","robert_robinson","chirality","radical","resonance"],"related":["Organic_chemistry","Conjugated_system","Unsaturated_bond","Lone_pair","Empty_orbital","August_Wilhelm_Hofmann","Olfaction","Delocalization","Resonance_(chemistry)","Electron","Atom","Covalent_bond","Benzene","Friedrich_August_Kekulé_von_Stradonitz","Resonance_(chemistry)","Resonance_(chemistry)","Bond_length","Single_bond","Double_bond","Pi_bond","Sigma_bond","Atomic_orbital","Molecular_orbital","Phenyl","Radical_(chemistry)","August_Wilhelm_Hofmann","Olfactory","Terpenes","Aliphatic_compound","Benzene","August_Kekulé","J._J._Thomson","Robert_Robinson_(organic_chemist)","Henry_Edward_Armstrong","Electron","J._J._Thomson","Electrophilic_aromatic_substitution","Wheland_intermediate","Conjugated_system","Eric_Clar","Wave_mechanics","Quantum_mechanical","Erich_Huckel","Aryl","Covalent_bond","Delocalized_electron","Pi_electron","Covalent_bond","Coplanar","Singly_even","Hückel's_rule","Cyclobutadiene","Furan","Electrophilic_aromatic_substitution","Nucleophilic_aromatic_substitution","Electrophilic_addition","Aromatic_ring_current","NMR","Aromatic_interaction","Moebius-Hueckel_concept","Antiaromatic","Cyclooctatetraene","Cyclobutadiene","Hund's_rule","Histidine","Phenylalanine","Tryptophan","Tyrosine","Nucleotide","Adenine","Thymine","Cytosine","Guanine","Uracil","Purines","Pyrimidines","Heme","Chlorophyll","Aromatic_hydrocarbon","Benzene","Toluene","Xylene","Xylene","Styrene","Phenol","Aniline","Polyester","Nylon","Benzene","Annulene","Cyclodecapentaene","Cyclotetradecaheptaene","Heterocyclic_compound","Furan","Pyridine","Pyrazine","Imidazole","Pyrazole","Oxazole","Thiophene","Benzannulated","Benzimidazole","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Simple_aromatic_ring","Naphthalene","Anthracene","Phenanthrene","Chemical_compound","Functional_group","Trinitrotoluene","Aspirin","Paracetamol","DNA","Ion","Cyclopropenyl","Cyclopentadienyl","Tropylium","Cyclooctatetraene","Tropone","Cyclophane","Homoaromaticity","Orbital_hybridisation","Borabenzene","Silabenzene","Germanabenzene","Stannabenzene","Phosphorine","Pyrylium_salt","Hexasilabenzene","Borazine","Metal_aromaticity","Möbius_aromaticity","Atomic_orbitals","Closed_shell","Möbius_strip","Möbius–Hückel_concept","Left-handed","Right-handed","Chirality_(chemistry)","Paradromic","Johann_Benedict_Listing","Carbo-benzene","Aromatic_hydrocarbon","Aromatic_amine","BTX_(chemistry)","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Saturate,_Aromatic,_Resin_and_Asphaltene","Simple_aromatic_ring","Pi_interaction"]}
