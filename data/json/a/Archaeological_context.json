{"cursor":"2835","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn archaeology, not only the 'context' (physical location) of a discovery is a\nsignificant fact, but the formation of the context is as well. An archaeological\ncontext is an event in time which has been preserved in the archaeological\nrecord. The cutting of a pit or ditch in the past is a context, whilst the\nmaterial filling it will be another. Multiple fills, seen as layers in\narchaeological section would mean multiple contexts. Structural features,\nnatural deposits and inhumations are also contexts. By separating a site into\nthese basic, discrete units, archaeologists are able to create a chronology for\nactivity on a site and describe and interpret it. Artifacts in the main are not\ntreated as contexts but belonging of them. Contexts are sometimes referred to as\neither positive or negative depending on whether their formation added or\nremoved material from the archaeological record. Negative contexts are cuts. It\ncan not be stressed too strongly how fundamentally important the concept of\ncontext is in modern archaeological practice.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Archaeological_context","recorded":1362553742,"links":13,"instances":["archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","sfma","archaeology_"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Methods and principles in archaeology"],"headings":["Suitability of single context planning","Context types","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cut","archaeology"],["fill","archaeology"],["feature","archaeology"],["cut","archaeology"],["fill","archaeology"],["relationship","archaeology"],["cut","archaeology"],["feature","archaeology"],["fill","archaeology"],["stratification","archaeology_"],["studien_zu_fundmünzen_der_antike","sfma"]],"members":["feature","fill","cut","relationship","studien_zu_fundmünzen_der_antike","stratification"],"related":["Archaeology","Archaeological_record","Cut_(archaeology)","Fill_(archaeology)","Archaeological_section","Feature_(archaeology)","Inhumation","Archaeological_record","Cut_(archaeology)","Single_context_recording","Fill_(archaeology)","Single_context_recording","Harris_matrix","Archaeological_plan","Archaeological_association","Relationship_(archaeology)","Cut_(archaeology)","Archaeological_section","Feature_(archaeology)","Fill_(archaeology)","Stratification_(archaeology)_","Studien_zu_Fundmünzen_der_Antike_(SFMA)"]}
