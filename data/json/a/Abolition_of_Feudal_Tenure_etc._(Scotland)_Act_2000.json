{"cursor":"3769","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000' was an act of the\nScottish Parliament which was passed by the Parliament on 3 May 2000 and\nreceived Royal Assent on 9 June 2000. [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/s-\ncotland/acts2000/asp_20000005_en_1 Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland)\nAct 2000] www.opsi.gov.uk, accessed 2 August 2009\n\nThe Act brought the feudal system of land tenure to an end on 28 November 2004\n(that is, Martinmas, as the Act provided for the 'appointed day' to be one of\nthe Scottish term days Whitsun or Martinmas). At this point, the former Vassal\nof an estate became the sole owner of the land, and the former Superior's rights\nwere extinguished. For a further two years, the Superior had the option of\nclaiming compensation, which was fixed at a single payment of such a size that\nwhen invested at an annual rate of 2.5%, would yield interest equal to the\nformer feu duty. Because of inflation eroding the value of duties fixed many\nyears before, this payment was in most cases extremely small compared to the\ncurrent value of the land.\n\nIn consequence of this change in the legal basis of land-holding, the Act also\nreformulated the legal basis on which conditions on the use of land can be\nspecified in the title to ownership of that land. Such title conditions (known\nvariously as Real Burdens and Real Conditions in the prior law) were combined\ninto \"Real Burdens\". Prior to the Act, a Superior could choose to enforce title\nconditions, or grant a Consent or Waiver (usually for payment) allowing the land\nowner to disregard the condition even if otherwise neighbouring property owners\nmight wish to enforce the condition. Existing conditions which were enforceable\nonly by the Superior were abolished, and only conditions enforceable by the\nowners of neighbouring property or by certain legal bodies on public policy\ngrounds were retained. Transitional arrangements allowed Superiors who were also\nneighbouring property owners to convert the old title conditions to benefit\ntheir land and hence themselves as owners of that land rather than themselves as\nfeudal Superior.\n\nFollowing this change in the legal basis for title conditions, the Title\nConditions (Scotland) Act 2003 was passed, reconstituting the mechanics of how\nnew Real Burdens and Servitudes can be created. These two Acts, together with a\nthird Act (the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004), commenced on 28 November\n2004.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000","recorded":1375055876,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Feu_(land_tenure)","/wiki/Feudalism","/wiki/Land_tenure","/wiki/St._Martin%27s_Day","/wiki/Scottish_term_days","/wiki/Vassal","/wiki/Inflation","/w/index.php?title=Title_Conditions_(Scotland)_Act_2003&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tenements_(Scotland)_Act_2004","#cite_note-2","#See_also","#References","#External_links","#Legislation","#Literature","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_from_1999","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2000/asp_20000005_en_1","#cite_ref-2","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm","/wiki/BBC_News_Online","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=4","http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/Civil/17975/Abolition","http://www.legislation.gov.uk//asp/2000/5","/wiki/UK_Statute_Law_Database","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit&section=5","http://www.ejcl.org/83/art83-5.html","/wiki/David_Sellar","http://www.burkespeerage.com/articles/scotland/page14e.aspx","/wiki/Burke%27s_Landed_Gentry","/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Scotland.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/30px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/29px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Scots_law","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Scotland-law-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Scotland-law-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scotland-law-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&oldid=550771200","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Scots_property_law","/wiki/Category:Real_property_law","/wiki/Category:Feudalism_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Acts_of_the_Scottish_Parliament_2000","/wiki/Category:Scots_law_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Abolition+of+Feudal+Tenure+etc.+%28Scotland%29+Act+2000&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Abolition+of+Feudal+Tenure+etc.+%28Scotland%29+Act+2000","/wiki/Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000","/wiki/Talk:Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000","#","/wiki/Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Abolition_of_Feudal_Tenure_etc._(Scotland)_Act_2000&oldid=55077
