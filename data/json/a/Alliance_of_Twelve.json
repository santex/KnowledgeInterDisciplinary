It is involved\nin the trade of intelligence and weapons as well as in blackmail. SD-6 is one of\nits subsidiary cells.\n\nThe organization was founded by Alain Christophe, once a CIA counterintelligence\nofficer, as well as other former agents of various other intelligence agencies\nand wealthy individuals investing in the spy trade after the Cold War.\n\nThe Alliance of Twelve is an enemy of the United States and a rival to the CIA.\n\nOrganizational structure The Alliance is led by a board of directors, one of\nthem being Arvin Sloane. Some members are from the private sector, but most are\nformer intelligence officers. All of them are wealthy. The organization is\ndivided into 12 sections, named SD-1 through SD-12. \"SD\" stands for Section\nDisparue â literally, the section which has disappeared in French (Sydney\ntranslates it as \"the section that doesn't exist\" in the episode Q&A). These\norganizational cells are spread over 12 major cities of the world. The Alliance\ntakes in recruits and tricks them to believe they are working for the CIA when\nin reality they are not.\n\nObjectives The purview of the Alliance is the black market trading of weapons,\nmilitary secrets, industrial intelligence, medical technology, computer\nadvances, and political agendas. Its clients include governments, corporations,\nwealthy citizens, families.\n\nThe Alliance aims to eventually reach world domination through its control over\norganized crime and the trade of intelligence. According to Jack Bristow and\nArvin Sloane, the Alliance once wished to change the world when it had achieved\nthis, and rid the world of corruption, but had become bloated and corrupt over\nthe years, diverging from their original vision and focusing instead on profit.\n\nActions According to Sydney Bristow in the episode Q and A, the Alliance of\nTwelve was responsible for the carbon proxy disaster in 1992, in which an\naccidental methyl isocyanate leak at the manufacturer plant in Bangalore, India\nkilled three thousand people and injured another thousand, leaving them\ndisabled. In 1996, near Kyoto, Japan, a bullet train accidentally switched\ntracks and derailed, killing a hundred and fifty people. The Alliance was also\nresponsible for that disaster. In 2001, the Alliance caused a transport plane in\nGermany to suffer mechanical failures outside Munich, killing twelve people. The\ndisasters were falsely believed to have been accidents. In truth, some were acts\nof revenge, others were personal favors to those who helped fund the Alliance.\nSome were distractions so that local resources were occupied so that SD-4 or SD-\n7 could infiltrate a building somewhere and retrieve sensitive data.\n\nSD-6 SD-6, headed by Arvin Sloane and based in Los Angeles, is the focus of the\nfirst two seasons of Alias. SD-6 pretends to be part of the CIA and states its\nobjective as \"retrieval and study of intelligence both military and industrial\nthroughout the world that is critical to the superiority and survival of the\nUnited States of America.\" Even its own members, initially including agent\nSydney Bristow, believe it is a black ops division of the CIA and only a handful\nof senior staff know the truth and are complicit in the deception. The name \"SD-\n6\" derives from the French, Section Disparue, which, in character Sydney\nBristow's words, means \"The Section that doesn't exist.\" Alias, Season One,\nEpisode 17, \"Q and A.\"\n\nIn the first episode of Alias, Sydney learns from her father, Jack about the\norganization's true character as a part of The Alliance of Twelve.\n\nDuring the course of the first season, other heads of the SD cells are\neventually shown meeting. Among them was Edward Poole, head of SD-9 (played by\nRoger Moore), who manages to convince Sloane to kill fellow SD head Jean Briault\nto influence an upcoming vote on whether to declare war on Alexander Khasinau,\nwho has eliminated rival groups FTL and K-Directorate. Another SD leader is\nidentified by the first name \"Ramon,\" but his last name and his SD cell number\nare unrevealed.\n\nParanoia and ruthlessness\n\n= Of SD-6=\nSD-6 branch was headquartered in the Credit Dauphine building in Los Angeles,\nwith entry through a special elevator to the sixth sub-level of the building.\nEvery person who entered would be biometrically scanned and visually confirmed.\nAs a security measure, all three areas of the foundations of the building itself\nwere rigged with C-4 explosives that would go off if the inner vault had been\nbreached during a security lockdown or for other contingencies. Fail-safe or\nlockdown procedures could be carried out only by Arvin Sloane, using his right\nindex fingerprint; presumably, other SD cells had similar contingency plans\n(such as for deterring a CIA raid, which happens in Season 2) that would make it\ndifficult to shut down.\n\nIn addition, SD-6 employed an internal security group responsible for\ninvestigating and terminating individuals who even know of SD-6's existence,\nthose believed to know about the true nature of SD-6, or those suspected to be\nDouble agents or traitors to SD-6. Sydney's fiancÃ©e, Danny, was murdered by SD-\n6's internal security division in Season 1 after Sydney revealed to him that she\nworks for SD-6, believing it to be a part of the CIA.\n\n= Of The Alliance=\nIn addition to the cell-like nature of Section Disparue, which presumably allows\nthe termination of entire SD cells in the event that it is wholly compromised,\nthe Alliance of Twelve is an utterly ruthless organization that constantly\nsuspects and conduct surveillance of even its head members.\n\nWhen Arvin Sloane's wife, Emily, admits to knowing of the existence of SD-6,\nArvin is told to have his wife killed as a test of loyalty. Arvin was able to\nwin a temporary reprieve because of his wife's cancer which would kill her soon;\nwhen her cancer is found to be in remission, he is again told that in order to\nbecome a \"full partner\" in The Alliance, he would have to kill his wife. He then\nfaked his wife's death by drugging her wine and putting her in suspended\nanimation.\n\nHaving proven his loyalty to the members of The Alliance, he is welcomed as a\nfull partner and injected in the neck with a tracking device and mini-microphone\nto have his movements and conversations recorded 24/7. Although Sloane was\nclearly privy to matters that only a handful of men and women knew about, he was\nclearly not yet part of an 'inner circle' within The Alliance board, suggesting\nthat there is some sense of competition and suspicion among the SD cells and\ntheir leaders.\n\nThe end of The Alliance The Alliance came to an end in the middle of Season 2\n(Episode 13, \"Phase One\") of Alias when Sydney stumbles upon information, with\nSark's aid, that leads her and Vaughn to believe there is one master server,\nserver 47 (in keeping with the Rambaldi sub-plot of the show, where 47 is a key\nnumber in Rambaldi's works), which could potentially have all the information\nthe CIA would need to shut down all of the SD cells simultaneously, thus acting\nas a sort of 'silver bullet' to the cell-like nature of the Alliance.\n\nAlthough the server was located on a Boeing 747 plane that was constantly\nairborne as a security measure, Sydney was able to pose as an escort for the\ncomputer technicians onboard during one of its landings and copy all the\ninformation from the server. When Jack attempted to go back to SD-6 headquarters\nto get confirmation that the information was genuine (as the CIA would only have\none chance), he was apprehended by the acting head Geiger (Sloane had taken off\nand was declared MIA by the Alliance) who accused him of being a CIA spy.\n\nKnowing she couldn't go back herself, Sydney called her SD-6 partner Marcus\nDixon to get the confirmation and tells Dixon the true nature of SD-6. With this\ninformation, the CIA was able to successfully raid all the offices of various SD\ncells around the world; Sydney was a part of the CIA team that infiltrated SD-6\nheadquarters in Los Angeles and rescued her father moments before he would be\nelectrocuted by Geiger. It is then revealed that Sloane had planned the\ndestruction of the Alliance, having a technician bypass the surveillance devices\nin his neck, and he and Sark had supplied Sydney with the information the CIA\nneeded to remove The Alliance â after he had cleared out (apparently) all\nRambaldi artifacts to his own location outside of SD-6. However, one artifact\nescaped Sloane's attention. This artifact, the Horizon, had been sought by\nProphet Five for thirty years, and was eventually retrieved (after coercing\nSydney) by Irina Derevko, who then betrayed Prophet Five, almost four years\nafter the fall of the Alliance.\n\nThe Covenant The Covenant is a large, powerful, and secretive\nintelligence/terrorist organization.\n\nThe Covenant was a \"loose affiliation of Russian nationalists\" composed of\nretired KGB and former Central Committee members, all dedicated to the new world\nenvisioned by Milo Rambaldi. It functioned much like an organized crime family.\nAt one point, it had six cell leaders, until Julian Sark and Lauren Reed (a\ndouble agent in the United States National Security Council who was Michael\nVaughn's wife) assassinated them in a bid for power. The Covenant had secured\nSark's release to gain access to his wealth as a Romanov descendant. McKenas\nCole had somehow managed to secure his own release and was now the second most\npowerful individual in the Covenant. During season 3, it was based in St.\nPetersburg. Two of its front companies were the Dryden Bank and Chantre Telecom.\n\nFollowing the end of Season Two and prior to the beginning of Season Three, The\nCovenant kidnapped Sydney Bristow and attempted to brainwash her into believing\nshe was a Covenant agent. Sydney operated as a double agent for the CIA using\nthe alias Julia Thorne for almost two years. Eventually, Sydney left the\nCovenant and had her memory of the missing years erased in an effort to prevent\nthe Covenant from gaining a crucial Rambaldi artifact. FBI Assistant Director\nKendall later told Sydney about those missing years and how she was able to\nescape the Covenant with his help.\n\nAt the end of season 3 Lauren Reed was killed and Sark was captured. In season 4\nthe Covenant has disappeared as a threat, and Sark later referred to the\n\"implosion of the Covenant.\" However, the \"implosion\" was a ruse perpetrated by\nElena Derevko, who was revealed to be the leader of the Covenant, and that Irina\nDerevko had actually been trying to prevent Elena's endgame. Elena's new\nheadquarters is based in Prague and was eventually raided, however she managed\nto escape.\n\nElena's endgame, based on her interpretation of one of Rambaldi's prophecies,\nwas an apocalypse called Il Diluvio, The Flood. Covenant operatives primed the\nworld's water with Rambaldi substances and Elena activated an enormous Mueller\ndevice in Sovogda, Russia. The device broadcast a frequency which caused those\nwho had consumed the tainted water to go into a mindless rage. Elena's intent\nwas that, after the entire world's population had been affected, the Earth would\nbe \"cleansed\" with very few survivors. With the help of Irina, the APO team\nmanaged to prevent The Flood, and Irina killed Elena. However, Nadia Santos had\nbeen captured and injected with the tainted water and sent out to fight her\nsister Sydney, as foreseen by Rambaldi. Sydney only managed to survive with the\nintervention of Arvin Sloane, who shot Nadia and put her in a coma.\n\nKnown Covenant Members *Elena Derevko (leader) *Roger Barris (leader) *Ned\nBolger (aka \"Arvin Clone;\" believed himself to be Arvin Sloane and not\nassociated with The Covenant) *Kazari Bomani *Sydney Bristow (alias Julia\nThorne; double agent) *\"Coke Bottle Glasses\" (real name unknown; Elena's\nunderling) *McKenas Cole (Elena's second in command and chief of operations)\n*\"Irina Derevko\" (real name unknown; volunteered to be doubled and killed by\nJack Bristow) *Katya Derevko (allied, possibly as a ruse to help bring down\nElena; exact status unknown) *Allison Doren *Johannes Gathird (one of the cell\nleaders assassinated by Lauren Reed) *Gerhard Kronish (a cell leader\nassassinated by Sark or Reed) *Leonid Lisenker (defected in North Korea) *Oleg\nMadrczyk (tried to turn Sydney into Julia Thorne; later killed by Sydney)\n*Calvin McCullough (former head of SD-6 Psychological Warfare Division,\nresponsible for creating \"Arvin Clone\") *Lucien Nisard (led a raid on the\nDepartment of Special Research to obtain Rambaldi artifacts) *Lauren Reed (co-\nleader of North American cell) *Olivia Reed *Uschek San'ko (Sark's main Covenant\ncontact.

It was formed at the beginning of Season 4 and is\nheadquartered beneath the Los Angeles Subway system.\n\nHistory and background Its first director was Arvin Sloane, who also gave the\norganization its name as an inside joke since the main entrance to APO's\nheadquarters was behind a maintenance door in the Los Angeles subway system\nmarked \"Authorized Personnel Only\". Concerned that increased public scrutiny of\nthe CIA and resulting red tape has impeded their ability to do their job, the\nCIA asked Sloane to set up the covert unit as one that is still governed by U.S.\nlaws, but unhampered by bureaucratic chain of command with no accountability\nexcept to themselves. Sloane was chosen because of his experience running SD-6,\nwhich successfully posed as a CIA black ops division for several years. All of\nits initial members were hand picked by Sloane, and in order to maintain APO's\ncover as a unit that officially doesn't exist, all members from previous seasons\nofficially resign from the CIA under varying circumstances to work for APO.\n\nAlthough headed by Sloane, APO ultimately answered to CIA Director Hayden Chase,\nand at the end of Season 4, Sloane was removed from his post and replaced by\nJack Bristow, who remained in charge of APO into Season 5. Sloane ultimately\nreturned to APO as assistant director, although unknown to his colleagues he was\nnow a mole for Prophet Five, a criminal organization that also pretended to be\nthe CIA in order to recruit. Sloane was allowed back into APO in order to use\nits resources to find a cure for Nadia Santos, his daughter, after the events of\nthe season 4 finale.\n\nPersonnel The first agents recruited and their new call signs are: *Jack Bristow\nâ Raptor *Sydney Bristow â Phoenix *Michael Vaughn â Shotgun *Nadia Santos â\nEvergreen *Marshall Flinkman â Merlin *Marcus Dixon â Outrigger *Thomas Grace â\nSidewinder *Rachel Gibson â Oracle\n\nNadia Santos (Evergreen) later joined APO at her request. Marshall Flinkman\n(Merlin) was recruited to serve as tech support. Eric Weiss also became a member\nafter crossing paths with Sydney and Vaughn during an APO mission.\n\nIn the 5th season, APO gained two new members following the apparent death of\nMichael Vaughn, Eric Weiss's transfer to Washington D.C. and Nadia's being\nhospitalized for her illness. Thomas Grace (Sidewinder) was recruited from\nanother division of the CIA, while Rachel Gibson (Oracle) was a former,\nunwitting agent of The Shed who thought she was working for the CIA while under\nGordon Dean.\n\nAs the series approached its finale, numerous changes occurred in APO. Arvin\nSloane was removed as director and replaced by Jack Bristow. As Sloane's endgame\nbegan to come to fruition, involving moles within the CIA itself, Bristow began\nto hide information from CIA oversight.\n\nIn the series finale, APO headquarters was destroyed by a large bomb planted in\nthe subway by Julian Sark, who was under orders from Sloane. APO and the subway\nwas evacuated, but agent Thomas Grace died in the blast. (The episode revealed\nthat APO headquarters was within a few blocks of Los Angeles City Hall, meaning\nthat APO must be in the Civic Center Station).\n\nThe series ends with a \"flash-forward\" to several years into the future (roughly\n2014). Marcus Dixon is referred to as \"deputy director\" but it is not indicated\nwhether APO still exists in this future time.\n\nProphet Five\n\nThe Shed is a fictional criminal operation in the television series [[Alias (TV\nseries)|Alias]]. The leader of the Shed was initially Gordon Dean, and later\nKelly Peyton, though both ultimately answered to a larger group: Prophet Five.\nProphet Five served as an Illuminati-like conspiracy group in the fifth season\nof Alias. The headquarters of Prophet Five was in Barcelona, Spain, with known\nShed satellite offices in Prague, Cleveland, Seattle, Chicago and St. Louis.\n\nHistory and objectives Prophet Five was started in the 1970s by Oskar Mueller as\na project funded by a private foundation. Parts of the project were\ncompartmentalized, but it is known that the \"best and the brightest\"\nmathematicians, linguists, scientists, and cryptologists, including James Lehman\nand the father of AndrÃ© Michaux, were recruited to decrypt a section of a 15th\ncentury manuscript known as the Profeta Cinque (Fifth Prophet) which was written\nin apparently unbreakable code. They succeeded, and discovered that the\nmanuscript referenced proteins, nucleotides and amino acids â advanced genetics\napparently ahead of its time. Lehman and Michaux assumed they were being tested,\nand presented their findings to a committee. The project was shut down and they\nwere sent back to their everyday lives.\n\nMeanwhile, RenÃ©e Rienne's father, Luc Goursaud, was involved in another part of\nthe project, as a test subject for clinical trials administered by Doctor Aldo\nDesantis. He was paid an impressive amount of money. It is unknown what he was\ntested for, but it is known that thirty years later, Desantis emerged from a\ncryogenic chamber looking identical to RenÃ©e's father. It is likely that Prophet\nFive experimented on RenÃ©e's father to develop experimental genetic doubling\ntechniques, possibly based on Lehman and Michaux's findings from the manuscript.\nRenÃ©e's father somehow discovered something about the experiments that disturbed\nhim, and he fled with his daughter across Europe, only to be taken away by\nDesantis. RenÃ©e witnessed this and swore revenge.\n\nA few weeks after Lehman and Michaux shut down the project, Michaux contacted\nLehman. He had begun to notice that those who they were told had worked on the\nproject were starting to die in mysterious accidents. He would then change his\nname and go into hiding (as Bill Vaughn) and urge Lehman to do the same.\n\nAccording to Irina Derevko most assumed Prophet Five to be a myth and discounted\nits existence, but around the time of the events occurring in Sovogda rumors\narose that Prophet Five was real and had gone active once again. The group\npursued the Horizon.\n\nThe key to finding this Rambaldi device lay with old SD-6 files. Prophet Five\nkidnapped and hypnotized Sydney Bristow, believing she had the knowledge from\nSD-6 that would aid in recovering the device. Sydney gave them fake coordinates,\nbut her mother Irina tricked her into taking them to the real location of the\nHorizon, a safety deposit box in Vancouver. Irina betrayed Prophet Five and\ndisappeared with the Horizon. Prophet Five's endgame also revolved around 15th\ncentury prophet Milo Rambaldi, specifically his interest in Sydney, whom\nRambaldi refers to as his \"Chosen One.\" Ultimately, Prophet Five's endgame\nremains a mystery, as the Twelve were on Sloane's orders. Since Irina and Sloane\nwere apparently after immortality, it may be assumed the Twelve were after the\nsecret as well.\n\nStructure and organization Prophet Five was led by a group of twelve, remarkably\nsimilar to the Alliance. In addition, the Shed operated similarly to SD-6, with\nmost agents believing they were part of a black ops division of the CIA. Members\nhave ties to British MI6, Russian SVR, French Intelligence, the Centers for\nDisease Control, pharmaceutical companies, and even the CIA. Prophet Five also\nhad some connection with the government of North Korea, as Doctor Desantis was\ntransported to a North Korean military facility after escaping RenÃ©e Rienne.\nMembers of the Twelve controlled entire sectors of technology, finance, and\ndefense. When Arvin Sloane is summoned to meet the twelve in Minsk, the twelve\nconsist of 11 men and one woman.\n\nPersonnel\n\n=Known aliases of the Twelve= *Y. Olnocvhev *S. Danforth *M. Aidarov *D.
