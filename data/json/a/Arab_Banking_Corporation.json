It obtained an offshore banking unit\nlicence from the Bahrain Monetary Agency on April 7, 1980, and began\noperations in the same month. It is headquartered at ABC Tower in the\nDiplomatic Area of Bahrain.\n\nBy April 1981, an amount of US$750 million was fully paid by ABC's original\nthree shareholders: the Ministry of Finance of Kuwait (later transferred to the\nKuwait Investment Authority), the Libyan Secretariat of Treasury (whose shares\nwere later transferred to the Central Bank of Libya) and the Abu Dhabi\nInvestment Authority.\n\nEach of the three shareholding groups held one-third of ABC's share capital\nuntil 1990. At the end of 1989, ABC's authorized capital was increased to\nUS$1,500 million. In 1990, ABC listed its shares on the Bahrain and Paris stock\nexchanges and increased its paid-up capital to US$1,000 million by a public\noffering in Bahrain and an international private placement.\n\nIn June 2008 ABCâs share capital was increased through a priority rights issue\nto existing shareholders of one share for every share held, i.e. 1.0 billion\nshares at nominal value of $1.00 each and at a premium of $0.11 per share. ABC's\nprincipal shareholders oversubscribed their rights in their pre-existing\nproportions. The allotment was completed on 18 June 2008, and ownership of ABC\nthe stood as Kuwait Investment Authority 29.7%, Central Bank of Libya 29.5%, Griffin, Donal and Ivry, Bob (1 April 2011) [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-31/libya-owned-arab-banking-corp-drew-\nat-least-5-billion-from-fed-in-crisis.html \"Libya-Owned Arab Banking Corp.
