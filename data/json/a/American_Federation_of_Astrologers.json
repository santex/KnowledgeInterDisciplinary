Now headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, AFA was established to\nencourage and promote the science and art of astrology through research,\nteaching, lecturing and practice. Ernest and Catharine Grant were its founders.\n\nAFA was originally named The American Federation of Scientific Astrologers, in\nkeeping with the European trend of the time which was the result of a strong\nintellectual movement within the ranks of astrologers in Europe towards the\nestablishment of astrology as a respected science. However, the name was changed\nto the American Federation of Astrologers in the mid-1940s.\n\nThe AFA has been active on several different levels since its inception,\nincluding the hosting of a periodic astrological conferences. The AFA was the\nfirst U.S. astrological organization to administer certification examinations\nfor astrologers, a program which it continues to sponsor. It is also a publisher\nof astrological books and has a world-class library of astrological literature\nand journals.\n\nAFA publishes astrological texts, primarily for intermediate and advanced\nastrologers, which are available for sale to members and non-members, both\ndirectly from AFA and through many bookstores. AFA also publishes a monthly\njournal, Today's Astrologer, which is distributed to the general membership.\n\nThere are various categories of membership available and open to anyone:\nAssociate and Research. Members located outside the United States pay higher\ndues as international members to compensate for the greater cost of postage,\nwhile those 65 and older pay reduced dues as senior members. Research members\npay a higher level of fees, and additionally receive a separate journal called\nthe AFA Journal of Research, which specializes in articles of relevance to\nastrological research. It is published periodically. Neither Today's Astrologer\nnor the Journal of Research is available for sale to non-members.\n\nIn earlier years, the AFA also published an annual Yearbook consisting of the\ntranscripts of all the papers presented at its annual conferences. This large,\nsubstantial publication began in 1939 and was issued annually until 1942, then\nmore sporadically in later years, appearing again in 1944, 1946, 1947, 1948,\n1950, 1952 and 1954. Copies have now become very scarce.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the AFA also issued a series of numbered publications called\nResearch Bulletins, each of which addressed a single research topic. These\nranged in theme from Astrological Americana to Angioma, and apart from\nAstrological Americana, which remains common, most of them have become scarce.\n\nThe AFA's most prominent activity as a publisher however has been in the\npublication of astrological books. Especially from the 1970s to the present\nday, it has been one of the leading publishers of astrological literature in\nthe world, and has also reprinted many otherwise out-of-print and often very\nscarce works from the early 20th century in high-quality new editions, as\nwell as translations of Morin's Astrologica Gallica, first published in the\n17th century.\n","linknr":87,"url":"American_Federation_of_Astrologers","recorded":1374523112,"links":["/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking","/wiki/Wikipedia:BUILD","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=edit","/wiki/Wikipedia:Only_make_links_that_are_relevant_to_the_context","/wiki/Astrology","/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=edit&section=1","http://www.astrologers.com/","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&oldid=563417988","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Astrological_organizations","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_July_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_too_few_wikilinks_from_November_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_too_few_wikilinks","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_November_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=American+Federation+of+Astrologers&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=American+Federation+of+Astrologers","/wiki/American_Federation_of_Astrologers","/wiki/Talk:American_Federation_of_Astrologers","#","/wiki/American_Federation_of_Astrologers","/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/American_Federation_of_Astrologers","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/American_Federation_of_Astrologers","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&oldid=563417988","/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&id=563417988","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=American+Federation+of+Astrologers","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=American+Federation+of+Astrologers&oldid=563417988&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=American_Federation_of_Astrologers&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4743748#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Astrologers","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Astrolo
