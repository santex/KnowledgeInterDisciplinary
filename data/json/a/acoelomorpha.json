Most species are free-living, some live on the surface of other\norganisms (ectocommensals). Traditionally, they were considered to\nbelong to the phylum Platyhelminthes. In 2004 molecular studies demonstrated\nthat they are a separate phylum, although their position in the tree\nof life is contentious; most researchers believe them to be basal among the\nBilateria, slightly more derived than the cnidaria. Recent (2011) results\nsuggest that they (along with [[Xenoturbella]]) may lie near the base of the\ndeuterostomes. However, some\nconsider the evidence for a position within deuterostomes weak and favor the\nplacement of Xenoturbella + Acoelomorpha more basally among Metazoa.\n\nEarlier (2007) work dismissed the phylum as paraphyletic, with Acoela and\nNemertodermatida as separate clades.\n\nAn ongoing (Feb. 2011) collaborative research project has \"the researchers ...\nconfident that they can reach an agreement about where acoels fit in\nevolutionary history\".\n\nAcoels are almost entirely marine, living between grains of sediment, swimming\nas plankton, or crawling on algae. Acoels have a statocyst, which presumably\nhelps them orient to gravity. Their soft bodies make them difficult to\nclassify.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"acoelomorpha","recorded":1372154269,"links":[],"instances":["phylogenetics","zoology","ocean","zoology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acoelomorphs|"],"headings":["Anatomy","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["basal","phylogenetics"],["marine","ocean"],["gut","zoology"],["epidermis","zoology"]],"members":["basal","epidermis","marine","gut"],"related":["Animal","Eumetazoa","Bilateria","Phylum","Planula","Flatworm","Basal_(phylogenetics)","Bilateria","Deuterostomes","Metazoa","Paraphyly","Acoela","Nemertodermatida","Marine_(ocean)","Sediment","Plankton","Algae","Statocyst","Symsagittifera_roscoffensis","Gut_(zoology)","Syncytium","Vacuole","Epithelium","Pharynx","Tapeworm","Ganglion","Epidermis_(zoology)","Statocyst","Ocellus","Hermaphrodite","Gonad","Gamete","Mesenchyme"]}
