{"cursor":"4705","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn gardening, annual often refers to a plant grown outdoors in the spring and\nsummer and surviving just for one growing season. Many food plants are, or are\ngrown as, annuals, including virtually all domesticated grains. Some perennials\nand biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience, particularly if\nthey are not considered cold hardy for the local climate. Carrot, celery and\nparsley are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their\nedible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. Tomato, sweet potato and bell\npepper are tender perennials usually grown as annuals.\n\nOrnamental annual perennials commonly grown as annuals are impatiens, wax\nbegonia, snapdragon, [[Pelargonium]], coleus and petunia.\n\nOne seed-to-seed life cycle for an annual can occur in as little as a month in\nsome species, though most last several months. Oilseed rapa can go from seed-to-\nseed in about five weeks under a bank of fluorescent lamps. This style of\ngrowing is often used in classrooms for education. Many desert annuals are\ntherophytes, because their\nseed-to-seed life cycle is only weeks and they spend most of the year as seeds\nto survive dry conditions.\n\nExamples of true annuals include corn, wheat, rice, lettuce, peas, watermelon,\nbeans, zinnia and marigold.
