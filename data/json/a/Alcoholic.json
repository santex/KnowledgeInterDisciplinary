It is medically considered a disease, specifically an addictive\nillness, and in psychiatry several other terms are used, specifically \"alcohol\nabuse\" and \"alcohol dependence,\" which have slightly different definitions. In 1979 an expert World Health Organization committee discouraged\nthe use of \"alcoholism\" in medicine, preferring the category of \"alcohol\ndependence syndrome\". In the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies, alcohol dependence in general was called dipsomania, but that term\nnow has a much more specific meaning. People suffering from\nalcoholism are often called \"alcoholics\". Many other terms, some of them\ninsulting or informal, have been used throughout history. The World Health\nOrganization estimates that there are 140 million people with alcoholism\nworldwide.\n\nThe biological mechanisms that cause alcoholism are not well understood. Social\nenvironment, stress, mental health, family history,\nage, ethnic group, and gender all influence the risk for the condition. Alcohol misuse has the potential to damage almost every\norgan in the body, including the brain. The cumulative toxic effects of chronic\nalcohol abuse can cause both medical and psychiatric problems.\n\nCompared with men, women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical,\ncerebral, and mental effects. name=\"Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K.,\nHertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003
