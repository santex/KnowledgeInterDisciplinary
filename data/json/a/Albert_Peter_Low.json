{"cursor":"4121","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"), Labrador, 1894.]] 'Albert Peter Low' (May 24, 1861 â October 9, 1942) was a\nCanadian geologist, explorer and athlete. His explorations of 1893â1895 were\nimportant in declaring Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic, and eventually\ndefining the border between Quebec and Labrador.\n\nHe was born in Montreal, Quebec, and attended McGill University,\ngraduating in 1882. He moved to Ottawa, Ontario to work as a surveyor and\nexplorer with the Geological Survey of Canada. Low was recognized by senior\nofficials for his excellent work and handed a series of scientific assignments\nin the North. Although his career is dotted with distinguished work, Low is\nperhaps best remembered as the commander of a 1903-04 Dominion expedition to\ndeclare Canada's authority over the Arctic, a journey that resulted in a\nbestselling book, The Cruise of the Neptune. In 1906 he was appointed director\nof the Geological Survey of Canada. In 1907, he became the first deputy minister\nof the Department of Mines. He retired from the department in 1913. He died in\nOttawa in 1942.\n\nLow was also an athlete, and he played ice hockey for two famous ice hockey\nteams, the McGill University Hockey Club, considered the first organized hockey\nclub in the world, and the Ottawa Hockey Club. In 1883, he played goaltender for\nthe victorious McGill Hockey Club in the 1883 Montreal Winter Carnival. The\nchampionship is considered the first Canadian championship. After moving to\nOttawa in 1883, he was a founding member of the Ottawa Hockey Club, formed\nwithin weeks of the 1883 tournament. In 1884, he would return to the Montreal\nWinter Carnival tournament as Ottawa's goaltender and shutout McGill. He was a\nmember of the Ottawa Hockey Club until 1889.\n\nAplowite, which is a transparent, pink-coloured cobalt mineral, is named in\nhis honour.\n","linknr":151,"url":"Albert_Peter_Low","recorded":1362477720,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1861 births","1942 deaths","Canadian geologists","Canadian explorers","Ottawa Senators (original) players","People from Montreal","McGill University alumni","Canadian geographers","Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada)"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/A.P._Low_Hamilton_River_Picnic_1894.jpg/220px-A.P._Low_Hamilton_River_Picnic_1894.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/16px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/35px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/40px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/WikiProject_Geology.svg/25px-WikiProject_Geology.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Canada","Geologist","Quebec","Labrador","Montreal","Quebec","McGill_University","Ottawa","Ontario","Geological_Survey_of_Canada","Natural_Resources_Canada","Ice_hockey","McGill_University_Hockey_Club","Ottawa_Hockey_Club","Goaltender","Montreal_Winter_Carnival_ice_hockey_tournaments","Shutout","Aplowite"]}
