{"cursor":"2940","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Roy Anthony \"Tony\" McNeill' (1941â1996) was a Jamaican poet, considered one of\nthe most promising West Indian writers of his generation, whose career was cut\nshort by his early death.\n\nMcNeill was born in Kingston, Jamaica and educated at Excelsior School and St.\nGeorge's College (where he was already known to his friends as a poet) before\nleaving to study in the United States. He studied creative writing at Johns\nHopkins University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, from which he\ngraduated with a PhD. He returned to Jamaica in 1975, where he worked as a\njournalist and assistant editor of the [[Jamaica Journal]] (1975â81), as well\nas in a variety of other jobs, including civil servant, encyclopedia salesman,\nand janitor.\n\nWhile a student in the US, McNeill began writing seriously. His first major\ncollection of poems, Reel from \"The Life Movie\", appeared in 1972 and\nimmediately established his reputation in Jamaica alongside his contemporaries\nDennis Scott and Mervyn Morris. This was followed by Credences at the Altar of\nCloud (1979) and Chinese Lanterns from the Blue Child, published posthumously in\n1998. Other significant work remains unpublished.\n\nMcNeill was known for his experimental style, influenced by contemporary jazz as\nwell as American poets like Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and E. E. Cummings.\nHe once said, of his first collection, \"I don't think I could write if my first\nconcern wasn't for the aesthetic.\" He also claimed that his greatest ambition\nwas to be a jazz pianist.\n\nHe was recognised by his peers as a prodigious talent, but McNeill was plagued\nby alcoholism and drug abuse. In one of his later poems he wrote, \"I realised\nvery early I had no gift for conducting a life. So I shifted my focus and sang a\nwreath.\" He died while undergoing surgery at the University Hospital of the West\nIndies on 2 January 1996. In an obituary essay, poet and literary scholar Mervyn\nMorris wrote: \"We have lost one of the finest of our West Indian poets, an\nextreme talent, recklessly experimental, awesome in commitment to his gift.\"\n","linknr":96,"url":"Anthony_McNeill","recorded":1375074285,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Jamaica","/wiki/West_Indian_literature","/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University","/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst","/wiki/Jamaica_Journal","/wiki/Dennis_Scott_(writer)","/wiki/Mervyn_Morris","/wiki/Jazz","/wiki/Walt_Whitman","/wiki/Emily_Dickinson","/wiki/E._E._Cummings","/wiki/University_of_the_West_Indies","/wiki/Mervyn_Morris","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&action=edit&section=1","http://www.peepaltreepress.com/review_display.asp?rev_id=17","http://www.peepaltreepress.com/author_display.asp?au_id=51","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/43014983","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&oldid=529507866","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1941_births","/wiki/Category:1996_deaths","/wiki/Category:Jamaican_male_singers","/wiki/Category:University_of_the_West_Indies_alumni","/wiki/Category:University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst_alumni","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Anthony+McNeill&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Anthony+McNeill","/wiki/Anthony_McNeill","/wiki/Talk:Anthony_McNeill","#","/wiki/Anthony_McNeill","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Anthony_McNeill","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Anthony_McNeill","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&oldid=529507866","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4773077","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Anthony_McNeill&id=529507866","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Anthony+McNeill","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Anthony+McNeill&oldid=529507866&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_McNeill&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4773077#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_McNeill","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["writer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1941
