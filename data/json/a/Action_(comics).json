It reappeared the following month, in toned-down form, and\ncontinued publication until 12 November 1977, at which point it was merged with\n[[Battle Picture Weekly]]. Despite its short lifespan, Action was highly\ninfluential on the British comics scene, and was a direct forerunner of the long-\nrunning [[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]].\n","linknr":314,"url":"Action_(comics)","recorded":1362677313,"links":12,"instances":["comics","comics","comic_writer","comics","artist","fishing","comics","artist","entertainment","comics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Censorship in the United Kingdom","Comics anthologies","Comics by Pat Mills","Defunct British comics"],"headings":["Publication history","Major stories","Collected editions","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/Action1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_sanders","comics"],["blockbuster","entertainment"],["ken_armstrong","comics"],["gaff","fishing"],["trigo","comics"],["tom_tully","comic_writer"],["costa","comics"],["ian_gibson","artist"],["mike_white","artist"],["tom_tully","comic_writer"],["trade_paperback","comics"]],"members":["trade_paperback","costa","tom_tully","ken_armstrong","mike_white","gaff","john_sanders","ian_gibson","blockbuster","trigo"],"related":["IPC_Media","Pat_Mills","United_Kingdom","Anthology_comic","IPC_Media","Pat_Mills","IPC_Media","D._C._Thomson_&_Co._Ltd","John_Wagner","John_Sanders_(comics)","Steve_MacManus","Blockbuster_(entertainment)","World_War_II","Cover_date","Penny_dreadful","Mary_Whitehouse","Mediawatch-uk","W.H._Smith","Frank_Bough","W.H._Smith","John_Menzies","Anarchism","Judge_Dredd","Polar_bear","Titan_Books","Ken_Armstrong_(comics)","Ramon_Sola","Great_White_Shark","Gaff_(fishing)","Oil_platform","Caribbean","England","Spitfire_Comics","John_Wagner","Trigo_(comics)","Tom_Tully_(comic_writer)","Costa_(comics)","Ian_Gibson_(artist)","Massimo_Bellardinelli","Jack_Adrian","Mike_White_(artist)","Gerry_Finley-Day","Nazi_Germany","Panzer","Hooliganism","Aston_Villa","Rangers_F.C.","Tom_Tully_(comic_writer)","Trade_paperback_(comics)","Titan_Books"]}
