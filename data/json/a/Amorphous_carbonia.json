It was first made in the laboratory in 2006 by subjecting dry ice\nto high pressures (40-48 gigapascal, or 400,000 to 480,000 atmospheres), in a\ndiamond anvil. http://books.google.com/books?id=6UGGgTXUJCEC&pg=PA198&dq=%2-\n2Amorphous+carbonia%22&num=50&as_brr=3&cd=2#v=onepage&q&f=false Amorphous\ncarbonia is not stable at ordinary pressuresâit quickly reverts to normal CO 2.

Retrieved 31 October 2009\n\nWhile normally carbon dioxide forms molecular crystals, where individual\nmolecules are bound by Van der Waals forces, in amorphous carbonia a covalently\nbound three-dimensional network of atoms is formed, in a structure analogous to\nsilicon dioxide or germanium dioxide glass.\n\nMixtures of a-carbonia and a-silica may be a prospective very hard and stiff\nglass material stable at room temperature. Such glass may serve as protective\ncoatings, e.g. in microelectronics.\n\nThe discovery has implications for astrophysics, as interiors of massive planets\nmay contain amorphous solid carbon dioxide.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Amorphous_carbonia","recorded":1362481781,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carbon dioxide","Amorphous solids","Physical chemistry","Astrophysics","Glass compositions"],"headings":["Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Amorphous","Carbon_dioxide","Silica_glass","Dry_ice","Gigapascal","Atmosphere","Diamond_anvil","Molecular_crystal","Van_der_Waals_force","Covalent_bond","Silicon_dioxide","Germanium_dioxide","Glass","Silica","Protective_coating","Microelectronics","Astrophysics","Gas_giant"]}
