{"cursor":"5412","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics the term 'additive function' has two different definitions,\ndepending on the specific field of application.\n\nIn algebra an 'additive function' (or 'additive map') is a function that\npreserves the addition operation: :f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for any two elements x\nand y in the domain. For example, any linear map is additive. When the domain is\nthe real numbers, this is Cauchy's functional equation.\n\nIn number theory, an 'additive function' is an arithmetic function f(n) of the\npositive integer n such that whenever a and b are coprime, the function of the\nproduct is the sum of the functions: :f(ab) = f(a) + f(b).\n\nThe remainder of this article discusses number theoretic additive functions,\nusing the second definition. For a specific case of the first definition see\nadditive polynomial. Note also that any homomorphism f between Abelian groups is\n\"additive\" by the first definition.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Additive_function","recorded":1362902620,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arithmetic functions"],"headings":["Completely additive","Examples","Multiplicative functions","See also","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Mathematics","Algebra","Linear_map","Real_numbers","Cauchy's_functional_equation","Number_theory","Arithmetic_function","Integer","Coprime","Additive_polynomial","Homomorphism","Abelian_group","Totally_multiplicative","Logarithm","Prime_number","Multiplicative_function","Sigma_additivity"]}
