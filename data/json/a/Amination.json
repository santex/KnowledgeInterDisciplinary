{"cursor":"1363","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Amination' is the process by which an amine group is introduced into an organic\nmolecule. Enzymes which catalyse this reaction, are termed 'aminases'. This can\noccur in a number of ways including reaction with ammonia or another amine such\nas an alkylation, reductive amination and the Mannich reaction. For example, -\nCOOH --> -CONH 2.\n\nAlkylation is the addition of an alkyl group where acylation is the addition of\nan acyl group (-COCH 3). Acylation has two steps; Acylation (the\naddition of an acylium ion) and then reduction. Reduction can often happen more\nthan once.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Amination","recorded":1362507835,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic reactions"],"headings":["Electrophilic Amination","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Amine","Molecule","Catalysis","Ammonia","Amine","Alkylation","Reductive_amination","Mannich_reaction","Acyl","Nucleophile","Electrophile","Oxaziridine","Hydroxylamine","Oxime","Electrophile","Carbanion","Enolate","Deamination"]}
