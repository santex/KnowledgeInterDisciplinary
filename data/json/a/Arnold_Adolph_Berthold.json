He studied medicine in GÃ¶ttingen in 1819 and wrote\nhis thesis under the direction of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752-1840).\nBerthold became a private lecturer in 1825 and began to teach physiology at the\nUniversity of GÃ¶ttingen where he spent the rest of his career. He is known as a\npioneer in endocrinology due to his experiments on the role of the gonads in the\ndevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics. He published important works on\nreptiles and amphibians as well as on avian physiology. In the field of\nentomology, he authored NatÃ¼rliche Familien des Thierreichs (1827).\n\nBerthold is particularly famous for his work on endocrinology. In 1849, Berthold\nperformed ground breaking experiments with chicken castration.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Arnold_Adolph_Berthold","recorded":1362510332,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1803 births","1861 deaths"],"headings":["References and external links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Arnold_Adolph_Berthold.jpg/220px-Arnold_Adolph_Berthold.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Col%C3%A9opt%C3%A8re_sch%C3%A9matique.jpg/35px-Col%C3%A9opt%C3%A8re_sch%C3%A9matique.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/35px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Soest,_Germany","Göttingen","Germany","Germany","Germany","Physiology","Zoology","Georg-August_University_of_Göttingen","Germany","Physiology","Zoology","Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach","Georg-August_University_of_Göttingen","Endocrinology","Reptiles","Amphibians","Bird","Physiology","Endocrinology","Germany","Soest,_Germany","Göttingen","Germany"]}
