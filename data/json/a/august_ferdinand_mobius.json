It was independently discovered by Johann Benedict Listing\naround the same time. The Möbius configuration, formed by two mutually inscribed\ntetrahedra, is also named after him. Möbius was the first to introduce\nhomogeneous coordinates into projective geometry.\n\nMany mathematical concepts are named after him, including the Möbius\ntransformations, important in projective geometry, and the Möbius transform of\nnumber theory. His interest in number theory led to the important Möbius\nfunction μ(n) and the Möbius inversion formula. In Euclidean geometry, he\nsystematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of\nsimplifying and unifying results.<ref>Howard Eves, A Survey of Geometry (1963),\np. 64 (Revised edition 1972, Allyn & Bacon, ISBN 0-205-03226-5)</ref>\n\nMöbius was born in Schulpforta, Saxony-Anhalt, and was descended on his mother's\nside from religious reformer Martin Luther.<ref></ref> He studied mathematics\nunder Carl Friedrich Gauss and Johann Pfaff. Möbius died in Leipzig in 1868 at\nthe age of 77.\n",
