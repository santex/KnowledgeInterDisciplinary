These microbes have no cell\nnucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles within their cells.\n\nIn the past Archaea had been classed with bacteria as prokaryotes (or Kingdom\nMonera) and named 'archaebacteria', but this classification is regarded as\noutdated. In fact, the Archaea have an independent evolutionary\nhistory and show many differences in their biochemistry from other forms of\nlife, and so they are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain\nsystem. In this system, the phylogenetically distinct branches of evolutionary\ndescent are the Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are further divided\ninto four recognized phyla, but many more phyla may exist. Of these groups, the\nCrenarchaeota and the Euryarchaeota are the most intensively studied.\nClassification is still difficult, because the vast majority have never been\nstudied in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their\nnucleic acids in samples from the environment.\n\nArchaea and bacteria are quite similar in size and shape, although a few archaea\nhave very strange or unusual shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of\n[[Haloquadratum|Haloquadratum walsbyi]]. Despite this visual similarity to\nbacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more\nclosely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in\ntranscription and translation. Other aspects of archaean biochemistry are\nunique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes. Archaea\nuse a much greater variety of sources of energy than eukaryotes: ranging from\nfamiliar organic compounds such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even\nhydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy\nsource, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and\ncyanobacteria, no species of archaea is known to do both. Archaea reproduce\nasexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and\neukaryotes, no known species form spores.\n\nInitially, archaea were seen as extremophiles that lived in harsh environments,\nsuch as hot springs and salt lakes, but they have since been found in a broad\nrange of habitats, including soils, oceans, marshlands and the human colon and\nnavel. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and\nthe archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant groups of organisms on\nthe planet. Archaea are now recognized as a major part of Earth's life and may\nplay roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of\narchaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or\ncommensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit the human gut and the\nruminant gut, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are used in\nbiogas production and sewage treatment, and enzymes from extremophile archaea\nthat can endure high temperatures and organic solvents are exploited in\nbiotechnology.\n","linknr":2280,"url":"Archaebacteria","recorded":1362506106,"links":131,"instances":["biochemistry","ecology","biology","biology","organisms","biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","ecology","biology","biology","genetics","biology","anatomy","reproduction","zoology"],"pdf":["http://www.im.microbios.org/0903/0903217.pdf","http://www.im.microbios.org/0903/0903217.pdf","http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/g38537726r273422/fulltext.pdf","http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/g38537726r273422/fulltext.pdf","http://archaea.ws/archive/freetext/1-9.pdf","http://archaea.ws/archive/freetext/1-9.pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/69/11/2019/_pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/69/11/2019/_pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/PXMTKQ8WH8X650ED.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/PXMTKQ8WH8X650ED.pdf","http://www.marine.usf.edu/genomics/PDFs%20of%20papers/wegleyetal2004.pdf","http://www.marine.usf.edu/genomics/PDFs%20of%20papers/wegleyetal2004.pdf","http://archaea.ws/archive/pdf/volume1/issue2/1-75.pdf","http://archaea.ws/archive/pdf/volume1/issue2/1-75.pdf","http://www.microeco.unizh.ch/uni/kurs/mikevol03/scinews/ASM_news_69_2003_503.pdf"],"categories":["Archaea","Extremophiles"],"headings":["Classification","Origin
