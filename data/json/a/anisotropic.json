It can be\n defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's\n physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity,\n tensile strength, etc.) An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a\n polarizer. And another is wood, which is easier to split along its grain than\n against it.\n","title":"Anisotropy","headings":["Fields of interest","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Birefringence","1: Cosmic_background_radiation","1: Isotropy","1: Polarizer","1: Wood","1: Wood_grain","1: Computer_graphics","1: Velvet","1: Anisotropic_filtering","1: Bilinear_filtering","1: Trilinear_filtering","1: Aliasing","1: Proximal","1: Region","1: Distal","1: NMR_spectroscopy","1: Chemical_shift","1: Benzene","1: Fluorescence_spectroscopy","1: Fluorescence_anisotropy","1: Cosmologists","1: Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation","1: Big_Bang","1: Physicists","1: Magnetic_anisotropy","1: Lightning","1: Plasma_globe","1: Chloroform","1: Liquid_crystals","1: Heat_conduction","1: Electronics","1: Crystal","1: Light","1: Crystal_optics","1: Optical_axis","1: Seismic_anisotropy","1: Wavelength","1: Inner_core","1: Geological","1: Sedimentary","1: Electrical_conductivity","1: Oil_exploration","1: Hydrocarbon","1: Sand","1: Shale","1: Resistivity","1: Formation_evaluation","1: Hydraulic_conductivity","1: Aquifer","1: Drainage","1: Water_well","1: Mineral","1: Quartz","1: Feldspar","1: Optical_mineralogy","1: Garnet","1: Echogenicity","1: Young's_modulus","1: Cambridge","1: Composite_material","1: Deep_reactive_ion_etching","1: Aspect_ratio","1: Microelectromechanical_systems","1: Microfluidic","1: Silicon","1: Diffusion_tensor_imaging","1: Magnetic_resonance_imaging","1: Brownian_motion","1: White_matter"]}
