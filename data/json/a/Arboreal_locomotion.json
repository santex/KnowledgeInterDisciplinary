In every habitat in which trees are present,\nanimals have evolved to move in them. Some animals may only scale trees\noccasionally, while others are exclusively arboreal. These habitats pose\nnumerous mechanical challenges to animals moving through them, leading to a\nvariety of anatomical, behavioral and ecological consequences. Cartmill, M. (1985). Climbing.

Furthermore, many of these same\nprinciples may be applied to climbing without trees, such as on rock piles or\nmountains.\n\nThe earliest known tetrapod with specializations that adapted it for climbing\ntrees, was [[Suminia]], a synapsid of the late Permian, about 260 million years\nago.
