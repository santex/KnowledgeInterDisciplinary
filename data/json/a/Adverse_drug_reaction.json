ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged\nadministration of a drug or result from the combination of two or more drugs.\nThe meaning of this expression differs from the meaning of \"side effect\", as\nthis last expression might also imply that the effects can be beneficial. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as\n[[pharmacovigilance]]. An 'adverse drug event' (abbreviated 'ADE') refers to any\ninjury caused by the drug (at normal dosage and/or due to overdose) and any harm\nassociated with the use of the drug (e.g. discontinuation of drug\ntherapy).
