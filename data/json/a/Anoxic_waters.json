{"cursor":"5094","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Anoxic waters' are areas of sea water, fresh water or groundwater that are\ndepleted of dissolved oxygen. This condition is generally found in areas that\nhave restricted water exchange.\n\nIn most cases, oxygen is prevented from reaching the deeper levels by a physical\nbarrier (e.g. mud) as well as by a pronounced density stratification,\nin which, for instance, heavier hypersaline waters rest at the bottom of a\nbasin. Anoxic conditions will occur if the rate of oxidation of organic matter\nby bacteria is greater than the supply of dissolved oxygen.\n\nAnoxic waters are a natural phenomenon, Richards, 1965; Sarmiento 1988-\nB and have occurred throughout geological history. Anoxic basins exist at\npresent, for example, in the Baltic Sea, Jerbo, 1972;Hallberg, 1974\nand elsewhere (see below). Recently, there have been some indications that\neutrophication has increased the extent of the anoxic areas in areas including\nthe Baltic Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.\n","linknr":361,"url":"Anoxic_waters","recorded":1362372899,"links":22,"instances":["environmental","ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical oceanography","Anoxic waters|","Aquatic ecology"],"headings":["Causes and effects","Anoxic basins","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dead_zone","ecology"],["hypoxia","environmental"]],"members":["hypoxia","dead_zone"],"related":["Groundwater","Dissolved_oxygen","Hypersaline","Redox","Bacteria","Dissolved_oxygen","Baltic_Sea","Eutrophication","Water_stagnation","Density_stratification","Thermocline","Sulfide","Anaerobic","Nitrate","Sulfate","Nitrate","Denitrification","Redox","Sulfate","Sulfide","Fossil","Lagerst√§tte","Bannock_Basin","Mediterranean_Sea","Black_Sea","Caspian_Sea","Cariaco_Basin","Venezuela","Gotland_Basin","Sweden","L'Atalante_basin","Mariager_Fjord","Denmark","Orca_Basin","Gulf_of_Mexico","Saanich_Inlet","Vancouver_Island","Canada","Anoxic_event","Dead_zone_(ecology)","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Meromictic","Mortichnia"]}
