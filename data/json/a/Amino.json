Primary amine || Secondary amine || Tertiary amine\n|-  ||  ||  }\n'Amines' are organic compounds and functional groups that contain a basic\nnitrogen atom with a lone pair. Amines are derivatives of ammonia, wherein one\nor more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or\naryl group. Important amines include amino acids, biogenic amines,\ntrimethylamine, and aniline; see for a list of amines. Inorganic derivatives of\nammonia are also called amines, such as chloramine (NClH 2).\n\nCompounds with the nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl of the structure RâCOâNRâ²Râ³ are called amides\nand have different chemical properties from amines.\n","linknr":532,"url":"Amino","recorded":1362508330,"links":71,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","protein_and_supramolecular","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Amines|*"],"headings":["Classes
