{"cursor":"5346","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn agriculture, 'agribusiness' is the business of agricultural production. It\nincludes crop production (farming and contract farming), seed supply,\nagrichemicals, farm machinery, distribution, processing, marketing, and\nretail sales.\n\nWithin the agriculture industry, \"agribusiness\" is used simply as a portmanteau\nof agriculture and business, referring to the range of activities and\ndisciplines encompassed by modern food production. There are academic degrees in\nand departments of agribusiness, agribusiness trade associations, agribusiness\npublications, and so forth, worldwide. In this context the term is only\ndescriptive, and is synonymous in the broadest sense with food industry. The\nUN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), for example, operates a section\ndevoted to Agribusiness Development which seeks to promote food\nindustry growth in developing nations.\n\nIn the context of agribusiness management in academia, each individual element\nof agriculture production and distribution may be described as agribusinesses.\nHowever, the term \"agribusiness\" most often emphasizes the \"interdependence\" of\nthese various sectors within the production chain.\n\nAmong critics of large-scale, industrialized, vertically integrated food\nproduction, the term agribusiness is used negatively, synonymous with\n[[corporate farming]]. As such, it is often contrasted with smaller family-\nowned farms.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Agribusiness","recorded":1372152597,"links":[],"instances":["cooperative"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agricultural economics","Industrial agriculture"],"headings":["Examples","Studies and reports","See also","Notes and references","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["ocean_spray","cooperative"]],"members":["ocean_spray"],"related":["Agriculture","Business","Crop","Farming","Contract_farming","Seed","Agrichemical","Agricultural_machinery","Processed_food","Marketing","Retail","Industry","Portmanteau","Academic_degrees","Trade_associations","Publications","Food_industry","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","Vertical_integration","Family_farm","Dow_AgroSciences","DuPont","Monsanto","Syngenta","Associated_British_Foods","Archer_Daniels_Midland","John_Deere","Ocean_Spray_(cooperative)","Purina_Farms","Agritourism","Global_warming","Biofuels","Oil_price_increases_since_2003","Energy_security","Greenhouse_gas","Fossil_fuel","Biofuels","Agricultural_economics","Management_studies","Agribusiness_management","Foreign_Agricultural_Service","U.S.&nbsp;Department_of_Agriculture","Agriculture_and_Agri-Food_Canada","Austrade","New_Zealand_Trade_and_Enterprise","Federation_of_International_Trade_Associations","Agrarian_law","Agrarian_reform","Agricultural_Marketing","Biofuel","Contract_farming","Energy_crop","Factory_farming","Industrial_agriculture","Land_banking","List_of_environment_topics"]}
