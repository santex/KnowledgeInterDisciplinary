{"cursor":"21777","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" such as this, precipitated from solutions of cell components, to perform\n bacterial transformations]] The 'AveryâMacLeodâMcCarty experiment' was an\n experimental demonstration, reported in 1944 by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod,\n and Maclyn McCarty, that DNA is the substance that causes bacterial\n transformation. It was the culmination of research in the 1930s and early 1940s\n at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research to purify and characterize\n the \"transforming principle\" responsible for the transformation phenomenon\n first described in Griffith's experiment of 1928: killed [[Streptococcus\n pneumoniae]] of the virulent strain type III-S, when injected along with living\n but non-virulent type II-R pneumococci, resulted in a deadly infection of type\n III-S pneumococci. In their paper \"Studies on the Chemical Nature of the\n Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types: Induction of\n Transformation by a Deoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated from Pneumococcus\n Type III\", published in the February 1944 issue of the [[Journal of\n Experimental Medicine]], Avery and his colleagues suggest that DNA, rather than\n protein as widely believed at the time, may be the hereditary material of\n bacteria, and could be analogous to genes and/or viruses in higher\n organisms.
