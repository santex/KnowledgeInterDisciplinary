The term is usually used,\nwithout further qualification, to refer to the 'standard atomic weights'\npublished at regular intervals by the International Union of Pure and Applied\nChemistry (IUPAC) The latest edition is The updated list of\nstandard atomic weights is expected to be formally published in late 2008. The\nIUPAC(International Union Of Pure And Applied Chemistry) Commission on Isotopic\nAbundances and Atomic Weights\n[http://www.iupac.org/objID/Note/nt50112469625981329917907 announced] in August\n2007 that the standard atomic weights of the following elements would be revised\n(new figures quoted here): lutetium 174.9668(1); molybdenum 95.96(2); nickel\n58.6934(4); ytterbium 173.054(5); zinc 65.38(2). The recommended value for the\nisotope amount ratio of Ar/Ar (which could be useful as a control measurement in\nargonâargon dating) was also changed from 296.03(53) to 298.56(31). and\nwhich are intended to be applicable to normal laboratory materials. These\nstandard atomic weights are reprinted in a wide variety of textbooks, commercial\ncatalogues, wallcharts etc., and in the table below.\n\nThe term \"atomic weight\" (of the element) is also used to describe this physical\nquantity, and is synonymous with it. However, its continued use has attracted\nconsiderable controversy since at least the 1960s\n(see below).\n","linknr":582,"url":"Atomic_weight","recorded":1362375475,"links":48,"instances":["unit","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1980/pdf/5210x2349.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1980/pdf/5210x2349.pdf","http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2006/pdf/7811x2051.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2006/pdf/7811x2051.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1992/pdf/6410x1535.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1992/pdf/6410x1535.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2003/pdf/7506x0683.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2003/pdf/7506x0683.pdf","http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1998/pdf/7001x0217.pdf","http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1998/pdf/7001x0217.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2002/pdf/7410x1987.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2002/pdf/7410x1987.pdf"],"categories":["Amount of substance","Chemical properties","Stoichiometry","Periodic table"],"headings":["Definition","Naming controversy","Determination of atomic weight","Periodic table with atomic weights","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["newton","unit"],["power","physics"]],"members":["newton","power"],"related":["Dimensionless_quantity","Physical_quantity","Mass","Atom","Chemical_element","Carbon-12","Unified_atomic_mass_unit","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Lutetium","Molybdenum","Nickel","Ytterbium","Zinc","Scientific_control","Argon–argon_dating","Boron","Turkey","California","Isotope","Isotope_analysis","Gold_Book","Atomic_mass","Weight","Force","Gravitational_field","Newton_(unit)","Poundal","Gravimetric_analysis","Nuclide","Isotope","Weighted_mean","Electromotive_force","Resolving_power","Power_(physics)","Molar_concentration","Isotope","National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","Mononuclidic_element","Fluorine","Avogadro_constant","Silicon","Metrology","Natural_abundance","Measurement_uncertainty","Sample_distribution","IUPAC"]}
