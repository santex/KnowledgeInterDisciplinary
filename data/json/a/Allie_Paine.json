In high school, Paine earned varsity letters in football,\n  basketball and baseball, and he earned a scholarship to play for the Oklahoma\n  Sooners men's basketball team. He played for four seasons:\n  1941, 1943, 1944 and 1947. He had spent two years\n  in the United States Army before finishing his college career.\n\nPaine, a guard, guided the Sooners to two Big Six Conference titles in 1944 and\n1947. As a junior he led the conference in scoring and was\nnamed both a First Team All-Conference and consensus First Team All-American\nselection. In his final season of 1946â47, he helped\nOklahoma reach the national championship game in the 1947 NCAA Men's Division I\nBasketball Tournament. The Sooners lost, however, to the Holy Cross Crusaders\n58â47. Paine graduated from Oklahoma with bachelor degrees in business and\neducation.\n\nAfter college, he played for the only season in the Professional Basketball\nLeague of America's existence as a member of the Oklahoma City Drillers. He appeared in five games and scored 17 points. In 1953, Paine moved to Enid, Oklahoma with his wife and became the\nbasketball and baseball coach at Phillips University. Two years\nlater, he started working with Robert R. Nigh and ultimately became the\npresident of Robert R. Nigh Associates for 35 years. Paine\nwas very involved in church and community life. Throughout his years he served\non the Enid Public Schools Board of Education, was a Boy Scouts of America troop\nleader, Little League baseball coach, member and president of American Business\nClub, and volunteered at soup kitchens with his church.\n\nAt the time of his death in March 2008, Paine was survived by his two children,\nsix grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren (his wife had died in 1998).\n","linknr":147,"url":"Allie_Paine","recorded":1374785002,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_men%27s_basketball","/wiki/Basketball","/wiki/Guard_(basketball)","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Norman,_Oklahoma","/wiki/1947_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament","/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma","/wiki/1944_NCAA_Men%27s_Basketball_All-Americans","#cite_note-OBIT-1","/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_men%27s_basketball","#cite_note-OBIT-1","#cite_note-MGUIDEHIST-2","/wiki/United_States_Army","#cite_note-OBIT-1","/wiki/Guard_(basketball)","/wiki/Big_Six_Conference","#cite_note-MGUIDEHIST-2","/wiki/Junior_(education)","#cite_note-MGUIDEHIST-2","/wiki/1947_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament","/wiki/1946%E2%80%9347_Holy_Cross_Crusaders_men%27s_basketball_team","/wiki/Bachelor_degree","#cite_note-OBIT-1","/wiki/Professional_Basketball_League_of_America","#cite_note-APBR-3","#cite_note-APBR-3","/wiki/Enid,_Oklahoma","/wiki/Phillips_University","#cite_note-OBIT-1","#cite_note-OBIT-1","/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America","/wiki/Little_League","#cite_note-OBIT-1","#cite_note-OBIT-1","/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-0","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-1","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-2","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-3","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-4","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-5","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-6","#cite_ref-OBIT_1-7","http://www.pulf.org/puafa/inmemoriam.php?top=3&sub=8&ss=7&action=detail&id=1327&fromrecent=yes","#cite_ref-MGUIDEHIST_2-0","#cite_ref-MGUIDEHIST_2-1","#cite_ref-MGUIDEHIST_2-2","http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/okla/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2008_09_mbb_guide_section8.pdf","/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma","#cite_ref-APBR_3-0","#cite_ref-APBR_3-1","http://www.apbr.org/pbla.html","http://web.archive.org/web/20100917075255/http://apbr.org/pbla.html","/wiki/Template:1944_NCAA_Men%27s_Basketball_Consensus_All-Americans","/wiki/Template_talk:1944_NCAA_Men%27s_Basketball_Consensus_All-Americans","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:1944_NCAA_Men%27s_Basketball_Consensus_All-Americans&action=edit","/wiki/1944_NCAA_Men%27s_Basketball_All-Americans","/wiki/Bob_Brannum","/wiki/Aud_Brindley","/wiki/Otto_Graham","/wiki/Leo_Klier","/wiki/Bob_Kurland","/wiki/George_Mikan","/wiki/Bob_Dille","/wiki/Arnie_Ferrin","/wiki/Don_Grate","/wiki/Dale_Hall","/wiki/Bill_Henry_(basketball)","/wiki/Dick_Triptow","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Norman,_Oklahoma","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&oldid=496311726","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1919_births","/wiki/Category:2008_deaths","/wiki/Category:Basketball_players_from_Oklahoma","/wiki/Category:Guards_(basketball)","/wiki/Category:Oklahoma_Sooners_men%27s_basketball_players","/wiki/Category:People_from_Enid,_Oklahoma","/wiki/Category:Phillips_66ers_players","/wiki/Category:Professional_Basketball_League_of_America_players","/wiki/Category:United_States_Army_personnel","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Allie+Paine&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Allie+Paine","/wiki/Allie_Paine","/wiki/Talk:Allie_Paine","#","/wiki/Allie_Paine","/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Allie_Paine","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Allie_Paine","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&oldid=496311726","/w/index.php?title=Allie_Paine&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4732526","/w/index.php?titl
