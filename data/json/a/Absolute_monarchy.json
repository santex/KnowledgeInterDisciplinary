An absolute\nmonarch wields unrestricted political power over the sovereign state and its\npeople. Absolute monarchies are often hereditary but other means of transmission\nof power are attested. Absolute monarchy differs from limited monarchy, in which\nthe monarchâs authority is legally bound or restricted by a constitution;\nconsequently, an absolute monarch is an autocrat.\n\nIn theory, the absolute monarch exercises total power over the land and its\nsubject people, yet in practice the monarchy is counterbalanced by political\ngroups from among the social classes and castes of the realm: the aristocracy,\nclergy (see caesaropapism), bourgeoisie, and proletarians.\n\nIn an absolute monarchy, the parliament (if one exists) merely stamp the\nmonarch's decrees. Countries where the monarch still maintains absolute power\nare Swaziland, Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Vatican City (the Pope,\nhowever, is elected).\n","linknr":402,"url":"Absolute_monarchy","recorded":1362554347,"links":82,"instances":["maoist","sweden","government","1809"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Monarchy","Political theories"],"headings":["Historical examples","Current examples","Contemporary monarchies","Scholarship","Bibliography","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg/100px-Heraldic_Royal_Crown_%28Common%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Benedykt_XVI_%282010-10-17%29_4.jpg/220px-Benedykt_XVI_%282010-10-17%29_4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Brunei.svg/22px-Flag_of_Brunei.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Flag_of_Oman.svg/22px-Flag_of_Oman.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Flag_of_Qatar.svg/22px-Flag_of_Qatar.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Flag_of_the_Vatican_City.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_Vatican_City.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Flag_of_Swaziland.svg/22px-Flag_of_Swaziland.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["aristocracy","government"],["reduction","sweden"],["instrument_of_government","1809"],["communist_party_of_nepal","maoist"]],"members":["communist_party_of_nepal","reduction","aristocracy","instrument_of_government"],"related":["Monarch","Head_of_state","Head_of_government","Political_power","Sovereign_state","Constitutional_monarchy","Constitution","Autocracy","Aristocracy_(government)","Clergy","Caesaropapism","Bourgeoisie","Proletariat","Swaziland","Brunei","Oman","Qatar","Saudi_Arabia","Vatican_City","Pope","Elected_monarch","Palace_of_Versailles","Denmark-Norway","Rigsraad","Swedish_Empire","Charles_XI_of_Sweden","Charles_XII_of_Sweden","Riksdag_of_the_Estates","Privy_Council_of_Sweden","Reduction_(Sweden)","Great_Northern_War","Age_of_Liberty","Gustav_III_of_Sweden","Union_and_Security_Act","Gustav_IV_Adolf_of_Sweden","Instrument_of_Government_(1809)","Divine_Right_of_Kings","James_I_of_England","Charles_I_of_England","England","English_Civil_War","Western_world","Perry_Anderson","Rhetoric","Brandenburg-Prussia","Frederick_William_I,_Elector_of_Brandenburg","Thirty_Years'_War","Hohenzollern","Junker","Königsberg","McGraw-Hill","Tsar","Russia","Peter_I_of_Russia","Nobility","Police_state","Tsarist_autocracy","Catherine_II_of_Russia","Alexander_II_of_Russia","Russian_Revolution_of_1905","Russian_Constitution_of_1906","Europe","Ottoman_Empire","Hassanal_Bolkiah","Qaboos_bin_Said_al_Said","Hamad_bin_Khalifa_Al_Thani","Abdullah_bin_Abdulaziz","N/A","Mswati_III","French_Revolution","Popular_sovereignty","Morocco","Constitutional_monarchy","Bhutan","Tshogdu","Nepal","Nepalese_Civil_War","Communist_Party_of_Nepal_(Maoist)","Nepalese_royal_massacre","Liechtenstein","Prince_of_Liechtenstein","Liechtenstein_constitutional_referendum,_2003","Constitution_of_Liechtenstein","Tonga","Brunei","Oman","Qatar","Saudi_Arabia","United_Arab_Emirates","Anthropology","Sociology","Ethology","Political_science","The_Eighteenth_Brumaire_of_Louis_Napoleon","Class_struggle","Louis_XIV","Bourgeoisie","Nobility","Perry_Anderson","Jacques_Bossuet","Constitutional_monarchy","Democracy","Dictatorship","Enlightened_absolutism","Thomas_Hobbes","Monarchomachs","Totalitarianism"]}
