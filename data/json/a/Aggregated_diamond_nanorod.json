Nanodiamond was\nconvincingly demonstrated to be produced by compression of graphite in 2003 and\nin the same work found to be much harder than bulk diamond, which\nmakes it the hardest known material. Later it was also produced by compression\nof fullerene and it was confirmed that it is the hardest and least compressible\nknown material, with an isothermal bulk modulus of 491 gigapascals (GPa), while\na conventional diamond has a modulus of 442â446 GPa; these results were inferred\nfrom X-ray diffraction data, which also indicated that ADNRs are 0.3% denser\nthan regular diamond. The same group later described ADNRs as \"having\na hardness and Young's modulus comparable to that of natural diamond, but with\n\"superior wear resistance\".\n","linknr":206,"url":"Aggregated_diamond_nanorod","recorded":1362375267,"links":23,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nanomaterials","Carbon forms","Superhard materials"],"headings":["Hardness","Synthesis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/C60_SEM.jpg/220px-C60_SEM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pascal","unit"]],"members":["pascal"],"related":["Diamond","Graphite","Hardness","Fullerene","Isothermal_bulk_modulus","Pascal_(unit)","X-ray_diffraction","Young's_modulus","Allotropy","Diamond_anvil_cell","Nanometre","Micrometre","Adamant","Carbon_nanotube","Diamond","Fullerite","Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","Rhenium_diboride"]}
