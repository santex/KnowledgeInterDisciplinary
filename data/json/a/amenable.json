The original definition, in terms of a\nfinitely additive invariant measure (or mean) on subsets of G, was introduced by\nJohn von Neumann in 1929 under the German name \"messbar\" (\"measurable\" in\nEnglish) in response to the Banach–Tarski paradox. In 1949 Mahlon M. Day\nintroduced the English translation \"amenable\", apparently as a pun.<ref>Day's\nfirst published use of the word is in his abstract for an AMS summer meeting in\n1949, [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=p-\ndf_1&handle=euclid.bams/1183514222 Means on semigroups and groups, Bull. A.M.S.\n55 (1949) 1054–1055]. Many text books on amenabilty, such as Volker Runde's,\nsuggest that Day chose the word as a pun. </ref>\n\nThe 'amenability' property has a large number of equivalent formulations. In the\nfield of analysis, the definition is in terms of linear functionals. An\nintuitive way to understand this version is that the support of the regular\nrepresentation is the whole space of irreducible representations.\n\nIn discrete group theory, where G has the discrete topology, a simpler\ndefinition is used. In this setting, a group is amenable if one can say what\nproportion of G any given subset takes up.\n\nIf a group has a Følner sequence then it is automatically amenable.\n","title":"amenable%20group","headings":["Definition for locally compact groups","Equivalent conditions for amenability","Case of discrete groups","Properties","Examples","Counterexamples","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Locally_compact","2: Axiom_of_choice","2: C*_algebra","2: Hyperfinite","2: Uniformly_bounded_representation","2: Finitely_presented_group","1: Mathematics","1: Topological_group","1: John_von_Neumann","1: German_language","1: BanachâTarski_paradox","1: Mathematical_analysis","1: Regular_representation","1: Irreducible_representation","1: Discrete_group_theory","1: Discrete_topology","1: FÃ¸lner_sequence","1: Hausdorff_space","1: Haar_measure","1: Affine_transformation","1: Convex_set","1: Locally_convex_topological_vector_space","1: MarkovâKakutani_fixed-point_theorem","1: Amenable_Banach_algebra","1: Discrete_group","1: Lebesgue_integration","1: Von_Neumann_algebra","1: Group_extension","1: Direct_product_of_groups","1: Ornstein_isomorphism_theorem","1: Finite_group","1: Counting_measure","1: Compact_space","1: Integer","1: HahnâBanach_theorem","1: Sequence_space#.E2.84.93p_spaces","1: Finitely_generated_group","1: Fundamental_theorem_of_finitely_generated_abelian_groups","1: Abelian_group","1: Index_of_a_subgroup","1: Solvable_group","1: Elementary_amenable_group","1: Grigorchuk_group","1: Free_group","1: Von_Neumann_conjecture","1: Burnside_group","1: Periodic_group","1: Linear_group","1: Tits_alternative","1: Jacques_Tits","1: Algebraic_geometry","1: V._Oseledets","1: Multiplicative_ergodic_theorem","1: Fundamental_group","1: Simplicial_complex","1: Non-positively_curved_space","1: Terry_Tao"]}
