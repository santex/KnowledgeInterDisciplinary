Ageing in humans\nrefers to a multidimensional process of physical, psychological, and social\nchange. Some dimensions of ageing grow and expand over time, while others\ndecline. Reaction time, for example, may slow with age, while knowledge of world\nevents and wisdom may expand. Research shows that even late in life, potential\nexists for physical, mental, and social growth and development.\nAgeing is an important part of all human societies reflecting the biological\nchanges that occur, but also reflecting cultural and societal conventions.\nRoughly 100,000 people worldwide die each day of age-related causes.\n\nAge is measured chronologically, and a person's birthday is often an important\nevent. However the term \"ageing\" is somewhat ambiguous. Distinctions may be made\nbetween \"universal ageing\" (age changes that all people share) and\n\"probabilistic ageing\" (age changes that may happen to some, but not all people\nas they grow older including diseases such as type two diabetes). Chronological\nageing may also be distinguished from \"social ageing\" (cultural age-expectations\nof how people should act as they grow older) and \"biological ageing\" (an\norganism's physical state as it ages). There is also a distinction between\n\"proximal ageing\" (age-based effects that come about because of factors in the\nrecent past) and \"distal ageing\" (age-based differences that can be traced back\nto a cause early in person's life, such as childhood poliomyelitis).\n\nDifferences are sometimes made between populations of elderly people. Divisions\nare sometimes made between the young old (65â74), the middle old (75â84) and the\noldest old (85+). However problematic this is, chronological age does not\ncorrelate perfectly with functional age, i.e. two people may be of the same age,\nbut differ in their mental and physical capacities. Each nation, government and\nnon-government organisation has different ways of classifying age.\n\nPopulation ageing is the increase in the number and proportion of older people\nin society. Population ageing has three possible causes: migration, longer life\nexpectancy (decreased death rate), and decreased birth rate. Ageing has a\nsignificant impact on society. Young people tend to commit most crimes, they are\nmore likely to push for political and social change, to develop and adopt new\ntechnologies, and to need education. Older people have different requirements\nfrom society and government as opposed to young people, and frequently differing\nvalues as well. Older people are also far more likely to vote, and in many\ncountries the young are forbidden from voting. Thus, the aged have comparatively\nmore political influence.\n\nRecent scientific successes in rejuvenation and extending a lifespan of model\nanimals (mice 2.5 times, yeast and nematodes 10 times) and discovery of variety\nof species (including humans of advanced ages) [http://longevity-\nscience.org/Mortality_Deceleration.html Late-Life Mortality Deceleration,\nMortality Levelling-off, Mortality Plateaus].
