It uses\nasynchronous time-division multiplexing, and it encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[cell relay|cells]].\nThis differs from approaches such as the Internet Protocol or Ethernet that use\nvariable sized [[Packet switching|packets]] or [[Frame Relay|frames]]. ATM\nprovides data link layer services that run over a wide range of OSI physical\nLayer links. ATM has functional similarity with both circuit switched networking\nand small packet switched networking. It was designed for a network that must\nhandle both traditional high-throughput data traffic (e.g., file transfers), and\nreal-time, low-latency content such as voice and video. ATM uses a connection-\noriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two\nendpoints before the actual data exchange begins. ATM is a core protocol used over the SONET/SDH backbone of the public\nswitched telephone network (PSTN) and Integrated Services Digital Network\n(ISDN), but its use is declining in favour of all IP.\n\nATM was developed to meet the needs of the Broadband Integrated Services Digital\nNetwork, as defined in the late 1980s.\n\n Turboways ATM 155 PCI network interface card]]\n","linknr":335,"url":"Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode","recorded":1362552217,"links":52,"instances":["data","engineering","telecommunications"],"pdf":["http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/atm/c8540/12_1/pereg_1/atm_tech/techgd.pdf","http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/atm/c8540/12_1/pereg_1/atm_tech/techgd.pdf","http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/atm/c8540/12_1/pereg_1/atm_tech/techgd.pdf","http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/atm/c8540/12_1/pereg_1/atm_tech/techgd.pdf"],"categories":["ITU-T recommendations","Link protocols","Networking standards"],"headings":["Technology","Deployment","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/IBM_Turboways_ATM_155.jpg/340px-IBM_Turboways_ATM_155.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["latency","engineering"],["flow_control","data"],["signalling","telecommunications"]],"members":["flow_control","latency","signalling"],"related":["ATM_Forum","Telecommunications","ANSI","ITU","Telephony","Data_transmission","Video","Computer_network","Time-division_multiplexing","Internet_Protocol","Ethernet","Data_link_layer","OSI_model","Physical_Layer","Circuit_switching","Real-time_computing","Latency_(engineering)","Connection-oriented","Virtual_circuit","SONET/SDH","Public_switched_telephone_network","Integrated_Services_Digital_Network","All_IP","Broadband_Integrated_Services_Digital_Network","Peripheral_Component_Interconnect","Jitter","Real_time_computing","Codec","Synchronous_Digital_Hierarchy","Plesiochronous_Digital_Hierarchy","Microsecond","T1_line","Queuing_delay","Echo_cancellation","Datagram","ITU-T","User–network_interface","Network-to-network_interface","Virtual_Path_Identifier","Virtual_Channel_identifier","CRC-based_framing","Operations,_administration_and_management","CRC-based_framing","Flow_control_(data)","Integrated_Services_Digital_Network","ATM_adaptation_layer","Ethernet_frame","OC-3","Packet_over_SONET/SDH","Maximum_transmission_unit","Asymmetric_digital_subscriber_line","Point-to-Point_Protocol","Ethernet","VLAN","VDSL","Virtual_channel_identifier","Virtual_path_identifier","Virtual_circuits","Virtual_Channel_Link","Data_link_connection_identifier","Frame_relay","X.25","Frame_Relay","Virtual_circuit","Traffic_contract","Quality_of_service","Traffic_policing","User–network_interface","Network-to-network_interface","UPC_and_NPC","Generic_Cell_Rate_Algorithm","Network_packet","Segmentation_and_Reassembly","Service_data_unit","Cell_Loss_Priority","Traffic_shaping","Network_interface_controller","Private_Network-to-Network_Interface","Open_Shortest_Path_First","IS-IS","Call_Admission_Control","Virtual_circuit","Signalling_(telecommunications)","OSI_model","Data_Link_Layer","Physical_Layer","Telephone_company","Internet_Protocol","FORE_Systems","Cisco_Systems","Dot-com_bubble","ATM_Forum","Broadband_Forum","VoATM"]}
