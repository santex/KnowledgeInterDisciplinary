Formed as \"The Band with\nNo Name,\" Amebix's original run was from 1978 to 1987, during which time they\nreleased three EPs and two full-length LPs. The group reunited in 2008 and\ndisbanded in November 2012.\n\nBy being one of the first bands to blend anarcho-punk and heavy metal music,\nAmebix are often cited as one of the key bands that helped to create the crust\npunk style. Peter Jandreus, The\nEncyclopedia of Swedish Punk 1977-1987, Stockholm: Premium Publishing, 2008, p.\n11. Such notable bands as Sepultura, Neurosis and Deviated Instinct have\npaid homage to the band.
