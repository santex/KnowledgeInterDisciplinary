Those certified as Airline Transport\nPilots are authorized to act as pilot-in-command of a scheduled air carrier's\naircraft under CFR 14 part 121. Additionally, ATP may be used as a name suffix,\ne.g. John Smith, ATP .\n\nAny pilot operating an aircraft for pay must start by obtaining a commercial\npilot license (CPL). Aircraft heavier than 12,500 lbs. also require pilots to\nhave a \"type rating\" (specific to the make and model of aircraft) certification\nas well as an ATP rating.\n\nTheoretical subjects included in the examination of ATPL applicants are:\n* Air law\n* Aircraft general knowledge\n* Flight planning and monitoring\n* Human performance and limitations\n* Meteorology\n* Operational procedures\n* Principles of flight\n* Communications (IFR & VFR)\n* Performance\n* General navigation\n* Radio navigation\n* Instrumentation\n* Weight and balance\n\nTo be eligible to take the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) ATPL\npractical test, commonly called the checkride, the candidate must have at least\n1500 hours of experience in aircraft and be at least 23 years old.\n\nThe term \"frozen ATPL\" has become popular outside the United States in the\nindustry as slang for someone with a (1) commercial pilot license with a\nmultiengine aircraft class rating, (2) a multiengine instrument rating, and (3)\na certificate of Multi Crew Coordination (MCC).
