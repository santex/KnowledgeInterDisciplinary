His given name was 'Sudatta'. He was extremely wealthy and a patron of\nthe Buddha. He gave Jeta Park to the Buddha having purchased it from Prince\nJeta. He honored the Buddha with laying out 1.8 million gold pieces in the\ngrove. Anathapindika upon death entered Tusita heaven, or the heaven of the\nBodhisattvas. Anathapindika was known as the \"foremost disciple in generosity\"\nas well as character.\n\nA banker (setthi) of SÄvatthi who became famous because of his unparalleled\ngenerosity to the Buddha. His first meeting with the Buddha was during the first\nyear after the Enlightenment, in RÄjagaha (the story is given in Vin.ii.154ff;\nSA.i.240ff, etc.), whither AnÄthapindika had come on business.\n\nHis wife was the sister of the setthi of RÄjagaha, and when he arrived he found\nthe setthi preparing a meal for the Buddha and his monks on so splendid a scale\nthat he thought that a wedding was in progress or that the king had been\ninvited. On learning the truth he became eager to visit the Buddha, and did so\nvery early the next morning (Vin.ii.155-6). He was so excited by the thought of\nthe visit that he got up three times during the night. When, at last, he started\nfor SÄ«tavana, the road was quite dark, but a friendly Yakkha, SÄ«vaka, sped him\non with words of encouragement. By force of his piety the darkness vanished.\n\nThe Buddha was staying in the SÄ«tavana, and when AnÄthapindika reached it\nspirits opened the door for him. He found the Buddha walking up and down,\nmeditating in the cool air of the early dawn. The Buddha greeted him and talked\nto him on various aspects of his teaching. AnÄthapindika immediately realised\nthe dhamma eye, thereby attaining the first stage of nibbana and became a\nSotÄpanna. He invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, providing everything\nhimself, although the setthi, the Mayor of RÄjagaha and King BimbisÄra asked to\nbe allowed to help. After the meal, which he served to the Buddha with his own\nhand, he invited the Buddha to spend the rainy season at SÄvatthi, and the\nBuddha accepted, saying \"the TathÄgatas, o householder, take pleasure in\nsolitude.\" \"I understand, o Blessed One, I understand,\" was the reply.\n\nWhen AnÄthapindika had finished his business at RÄjagaha he set out towards\nSÄvatthi, giving orders along the way to his friends and acquaintances to\nprepare dwellings, parks, rest-houses and gifts all along the road to SÄvatthi\nin preparation for the Buddha's visit. He had many friends and acquaintances and\nhe was Ädeyyavaco (his word was held to be of weight), loc. cit., p. 158.\nBut see J. i.92, where it is said that AnÄthapindika bore all the expenses of\nthese preparations. [[VihÄra]]s were built costing l,000 pieces each, a\n[[yojana]] apart from each other.\n\nUnderstanding the request implied in the Buddha's words when he accepted the\ninvitation, AnÄthapindika looked out for a quiet spot near SÄvatthi where the\nBuddha and the monks might dwell, and his eye fell on the park of JetakumÄra.\nHe bought the park at great expense and erected therein the famous\nJetavanÄrÄma. As a result of this and of his numerous other benefactions in the\ncause of the SÄsana, AnÄthapindika came to be recognised as the chief of alms-\ngivers (A.i.25).\n\n\nAnÄthapindika's personal name was Sudatta, but he was always called\nAnÄthapindika (AA.i.208; MA.i.50) (feeder of the destitute) because of his\nmunificence; he was, however, very pleased when the Buddha addressed him by his\nown name (Vin.ii.156). He spent eighteen crores on the purchase of Jetavana and\na like sum on the construction of the vihÄra; another eighteen crores were spent\nin the festival of dedication. He fed one hundred monks in his house daily in\naddition to meals provided for guests, people of the village, invalids, etc.\nFive hundred seats were always ready in his house for any guests who might come\n(AA.i.208-9. He fed 1,000 monks daily says DhA.i.128; but see J. iii.119, where\na monk, who had come from far away and had missed the meal hour, had to starve.)\n\nAnÄthapindika's father was the setthi Sumana (AA. loc. cit). The name of\nAnÄthapindika's brother was SubhÅ«ti.\n\nAnÄthapindika married a woman called PuÃ±Ã±alakkhanÄ (J.ii.410; J. iii.435, who\nwas the sister of the setthi of RÄjagaha. SA.i.240). He had a son KÄla and three\ndaughters, MahÄ-SubhaddÄ, CÅ«la-SubhaddÄ and SumanÄ. (Besides KÄla, AnÄthapindika\nhad another son, who joined the Order under SubhÅ«ti Thera; AA.ii.865). Mention\nis also made of a daughter-in law, SujÄtÄ by name, daughter of DhanaÃ±jaya and\nthe youngest sister of VisÄkhÄ. She was very haughty and ill-treated the\nservants (J.ii.347).\n\nThe son, in spite of his father's efforts, showed no piety until he was finally\nbribed to go to the vihÄra and listen to the Buddha's preaching. The daughters,\non the other hand, were most dutiful and helped their father in ministering to\nthe monks. The two elder ones attained to the First Fruit of the Path, married,\nand went to live with the families of their husbands. SumanÄ obtained the Second\nFruit of the Path, but remained unmarried. Overwhelmed with disappointment\nbecause of her failure in finding a husband, she refused to eat and died and was\nreborn in Tusita (DhA.i.128f).\n\nThe [[Bhadraghata JÄtaka]] (J.ii.431) tells us of a nephew of AnÄthapindika who\nsquandered his inheritance of forty crores. His uncle gave him first one\nthousand and then another five hundred with which to trade. This also he\nsquandered. AnÄthapindika then gave him two garments. On applying for further\nhelp the man was taken by the neck and pushed out of doors. A little later he\nwas found dead by a side wall.\n\nThe books also mention a girl, PunnÄ, who was a slave in AnÄthapindika's\nhousehold. On one occasion when the Buddha was starting on one of his periodical\ntours from Jetavana, the king, AnÄthapindika, and other eminent patrons failed\nto stop him; PunnÄ, however, succeeded, and in recognition of this service\nAnÄthapindika adopted her as his daughter (MA.i.347-8). On uposatha days his\nwhole household kept the fast; on all occasions they kept the paÃ±casÄ«la\ninviolate (J.iii.257).\n\nA story is told of one of his labourers who had forgotten the day and gone to\nwork; but remembering later, he insisted on keeping the fast and died of\nstarvation. He was reborn as a deva (MA.i.540-1).\n\nAnÄthapindika had a business village in KÄsi and the superintendent of the\nvillage had orders to feed any monks who came there (Vin.iv.162f). One of his\nservants bore the inauspicious name of KÄlakanni (curse); he and the banker had\nbeen playmates as children, and KÄlakanni, having fallen on evil days, entered\nthe banker's service. The latter's friends protested against his having a man\nwith so unfortunate a name in his household, but he refused to listen to them.\nOne day when AnÄthapindika was away from home on business, burglars came to rob\nhis house, but KÄlakanni with great presence of mind drove them away (J.i.364f).\n\nA similar story is related of another friend of his who was also in his service\n(J.i.441).\n\nAll his servants, however, were not so intelligent. A slave woman of his, seeing\nthat a fly had settled on her mother, hit her with a pestle in order to drive it\naway, and killed her (J.i.248f).\n\nA slave girl of his borrowed an ornament from his wife and went with her\ncompanions to the pleasure garden. There she became friendly with a man who\nevidently desired to rob her of her ornaments. On discovering his intentions,\nshe pushed him into a well and killed him with a stone (J.iii.435).\n\nThe story of AnÄthapindika's cowherd, Nanda, is given elsewhere.\n\nAll the banker's friends were not virtuous; one of them kept a tavern (J.i.251).\nAs a result of AnÄthapindika's selfless generosity he was gradually reduced to\npoverty. But he continued his gifts even when he had only bird-seed and sour\ngruel. The devata who dwelt over his gate appeared before him one night and\nwarned him of his approaching penury; it is said that every time the Buddha or\nhis monks came to the house she had to leave her abode over the gate and that\nthis was inconvenient to her and caused her to be jealous. AnÄthapindika paid no\nattention to her warnings and asked her to leave the house. She left with her\nchildren, but could find no other lodging and sought counsel from various gods,\nincluding Sakka. Sakka advised her to recover for AnÄthapindika the eighteen\ncrores that debtors owed him, another eighteen that lay in the bottom of the\nsea, and yet eighteen more lying unclaimed. She did so and was readmitted\n(DhA.iii.10ff; J. i.227ff).\n\nAnÄthapindika went regularly to see the Buddha twice a day, sometimes with many\nfriends (J.i.95ff.; he went three times says J. i.226), and always taking with\nhim alms for the young novices. But we are told that he never asked a question\nof the Buddha lest he should weary him. He did not wish the Buddha to feel\nobliged to preach to him in return for his munificence (DhA.i.3). But the Buddha\nof his own accord preached to him on various occasions; several such sermons are\nmentioned in the Anguttara NikÄya:\n* on the importance of having a well-guarded mind like a well-protected gable in\n  a house (A.i.261f);\n* on the benefits the recipient of food obtains (life, beauty, happiness,\n  strength);\n* on the four obligations that make up the pious householder's path of duty\n  (gihisÄmikiccÄni - waiting on the Order with robes, food, lodgings, medical\n  requirements. Referred to also in S. v.387, where AnÄthapindika expresses his\n  satisfaction that he had never failed in these obligations);\n* on the four conditions of success that are hard to win (wealth gotten by\n  lawful means, good report, longevity, happy rebirth);\n* on the four kinds of happiness which a householder should seek (ownership,\n  wealth, debtless ness, blamelessness) (these various tetrads are given in\n  A.ii.64ff).\n* on the five kinds of enjoyment which result from wealth rightfully obtained\n  (enjoyment - experienced by oneself and by one's friends and relations,\n  security in times of need, ability to pay taxes and to spend on one's\n  religion, the giving of alms to bring about a happy rebirth, A.iii.45-6);\n* the five things which are very desirable but difficult to obtain (long life,\n  beauty, happiness, glory, good condition of rebirths, A.iii.47-8);\n* the five sinful acts that justify a man's being called wicked (hurting of\n  life, etc. A.iii.204);\n* the inadvisability of being satisfied with providing requisites for monks\n  without asking oneself if one also experiences the joy that is born of ease of\n  mind (evidently a gentle warning to AnÄthapindika, A.iii.206-7).\n\nThe Buddha preached the VelÄma Sutta to encourage AnÄthapindika when he had\nbeen reduced to poverty and felt disappointed that he could no longer provide\nluxuries for the monks (A.iv.392ff). On another occasion the Buddha tells\nAnÄthapindika that the SotÄpanna is a happy man because he is free from various\nfears: fear of being born in hell, among beasts, in the realm of Peta or in\nsome other unhappy state; he is assured of reaching Enlightenment (A.iv.405f,\nalso S. v.387f).\n\nElsewhere the Buddha tells AnÄthapindika that it is not every rich man who knows\nhow to indulge in the pleasures of sense legitimately and profitably\n(A.v.177ff).\n\nThere is, however, at least one sutta preached as a result of a question put by\nAnÄthapindika himself regarding gifts and those who are worthy to receive them\n(A.i.62-3); and we also find him consulting the Buddha regarding the marriage of\nhis daughter, Cola SubhaddÄ (DhA.iii.466).\n\nAnÄthapindika died before the Buddha. As he lay grievously ill he sent a special\nmessage to SÄriputta asking him to come (again, probably, because he did not\nwant to trouble the Buddha). SÄriputta went with Ananda and preached to him the\nAnÄthapindikovÄda Sutta (M.iii.258f.; see also S. v.380-7, which contain\naccounts of incidents connected with this visit). His pains left him as he\nconcentrated his mind on the virtuous life he had led and the many acts of piety\nhe had done. Later he fed the Elders with food from his own cooking-pot, but\nquite soon afterwards he died and was born in the Tusita heaven. That same night\nhe visited the Buddha at Jetavana and uttered a song of praise of Jetavana and\nof SÄriputta who lived there, admonishing others to follow the Buddha's\nteaching. In heaven he will live as long as VisÄkhÄ and Sakka (DA.iii.740).\n\nVarious incidents connected with AnÄthapindika are to be found in the JÄtakas.\nOn one occasion his services were requisitioned to hold an inquiry on a\n[[bhikkhuni]] who had become pregnant (J.i.148).\n\nOnce when the Buddha went on tour from Jetavana, AnÄthapindika was perturbed\nbecause there was no one left for him to worship; at the Buddha's suggestion, an\noffshoot from the Bodhi tree at Gaya was planted at the entrance to Jetavana\n(J.iv.229).\n\nOnce a brahmin, hearing of AnÄthapindika's luck, comes to him in order to find\nout where this luck lay so that he may obtain it. The brahmin discovered that it\nlay in the comb of a white cock belonging to AnÄthapindika; he asks for the cock\nand it is given to him, but the luck flies away elsewhere, settling first in a\npillow, then in a jewel, a club, and, finally, in the head of AnÄthapindika's\nwife. The brahmin's desire is thus frustrated (J.ii.410f).\n\nOn two occasions he was waylaid by rogues. Once they tried to make him drink\ndrugged toddy. He was at first shocked by their impertinence, but, later,\nwishing to reform them, frightened them away (J.i.268).\n\nOn the other occasion, the robbers lay in wait for him as he returned from one\nof his villages; by hurrying back he escaped them (J.ii.413). Whenever\nAnÄthapindika visited the Buddha, he was in the habit of relating to the\nBuddha various things which had come under his notice, and the Buddha would\nrelate to him stories from the past containing similar incidents. Among the\nJÄtakas so preached are: Apannaka, KhadirahgÄra, RohinÄ«, VÄrunÄ«, PunnapÄti,\nKÄlakanni, AkataÃ±Ã±Å«, VerÄ«, KusanÄli, Siri, Bhadraghata, Visayha, Hiri,\nSirikÄlakannÄ« and SulasÄ.\n\nAnÄthapindika was not only a shrewd business man but also a keen debater. The\nAnguttara NikÄya (A.v.185-9) records a visit he paid to the ParibbÄjakas when he\ncould think of nothing better to do. A lively debate ensues regarding their\nviews and the views of the Buddha as expounded by AnÄthapindika. The latter\nsilences his opponents. When the incident is reported to the Buddha, he speaks\nin high praise of AnÄthapindika and expresses his admiration of the way in which\nhe handled the discussion.\n\nDuring the time of Padumattara Buddha AnÄthapindika had been a householder of\nHamsavatÄ«. One day he heard the Buddha speak of a lay-disciple of his as being\nthe chief of alms-givers. The householder resolved to be so designated himself\nin some future life and did many good deeds to that end. His wish was fulfilled\nin this present life.
