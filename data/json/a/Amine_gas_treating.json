{"cursor":"8305","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Amine gas treating', also known as 'gas sweetening' and 'acid gas removal',\nrefers to a group of processes that use aqueous solutions of various alkylamines\n(commonly referred to simply as amines) to remove hydrogen sulfide\n(H 2S) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from gases. It is a common unit process used in\nrefineries, and is also used in petrochemical plants, natural gas processing\nplants and other industries.\n\nProcesses within oil refineries or chemical processing plants that remove\nhydrogen sulfide are referred to as \"sweetening\" processes because the odor of\nthe processed products is improved by the absence of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nMany different amines are used in gas treating:\n* Diethanolamine (DEA)\n* Monoethanolamine (MEA)\n* Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)\n* Diisopropanolamine (DIPA)\n* Aminoethoxyethanol (Diglycolamine) (DGA)\n\nThe most commonly used amines in industrial plants are the alkanolamines DEA,\nMEA, and MDEA. These amines are also used in many oil refineries to remove sour\ngases from liquid hydrocarbons such as liquified petroleum gas (LPG).\n","linknr":154,"url":"Amine_gas_treating","recorded":1362508762,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/sulfur/sulfumcs06.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical processes","Oil refining","Unit processes","Acid gas control","Natural gas technology"],"headings":["Description of a typical amine treater","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/4/014cced2b73c22eb88cdc6901afb0c9d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/AmineTreating.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Amine","Hydrogen_sulfide","Carbon_dioxide","Unit_process","Oil_refinery","Petrochemical","Natural_gas_processing","Diethanolamine","Ethanolamine","Methyl_diethanolamine","Diisopropanolamine","Sour_gas","Liquified_petroleum_gas","Hydrocarbon","Process_Flow_diagram","Reboiler","Hydrodesulfurization","Claus_process","Sulfur","United_States_Geological_Survey","WSA_Process","Natural_gas","Petroleum_refining_processes","Ammonia_production","Flue_gas","Conventional_coal-fired_power_plant","Carbon_steel","Carbon_capture_and_storage","Conventional_coal-fired_power_plant","Ammonia","Steam_reforming","Hydrogen","Ammonia_production","Hydrodesulfurization","WSA_Process","Claus_process","Selexol","Rectisol","Amine","Ionic_liquid"]}
