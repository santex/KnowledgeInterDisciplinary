Advocacy may be motivated from\nmoral, ethical or faith principles or simply a desire to protect an asset of\ninterest. Advocacy can include many activities that a person or organization\nundertakes including media campaigns, public speaking, commissioning and\npublishing research or polls or the filing of an amicus brief. Lobbying (often\nby lobby groups) is a form of advocacy where a direct approach is made to\nlegislators on an issue which plays a significant role in modern\npolitics. Research is beginning to explore how advocacy groups use\nsocial media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Advocacy","recorded":1362535151,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ldnresearchtrustfiles.co.uk/docs/2010.pdf"],"categories":["Advocacy groups","Activism by method"],"headings":["Forms of advocacy","Advocacy groups","Transnational advocacy","Advocacy and the Internet","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Political_science","Advocacy_group","Amicus_curiae","Lobbying","Lobby_groups","Budget_advocacy","Issue_advocacy_ads","Advocate","Advocacy_group","Lobbying","Citizen_Advocacy_organisations","Advocate","Advocacy_Evaluation","Budget_advocacy","Health_advocacy","Issue_advocacy_ads","Lobbying","Public_Library_Advocacy","Justice_for_Khojaly","Networked_advocacy"]}
