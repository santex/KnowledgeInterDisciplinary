{"cursor":"50641","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'academic discipline', or 'field of study', is a branch of knowledge that is\ntaught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are\ndefined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is\npublished, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to\nwhich their practitioners belong.\n\nHowever, there exists no formal criteria for when educational programs and\nscholarly journals form an academic discipline. A huge difference exists\nbetween, on the one hand, well established disciplines that exist in almost all\nuniversities all over the world, have a long history, and have a well\nestablished set of journals and conferences, and, on the other hand, suggestions\nfor new fields supported only by few universities and publications. Fields of\nstudy usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing\nlines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous.
