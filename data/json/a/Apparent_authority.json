{"cursor":"8583","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the United States and in the United Kingdom, 'Apparent authority' (also\ncalled \"ostensible authority\") relates to the doctrines of the law of agency. It\nis relevant particularly in corporate law and constitutional law. Apparent\nauthority refers to a situation where a reasonable person would understand that\nan agent had authority to act. This means a principal is bound by the agent's\nactions, even though the agent had no actual authority, whether express or\nimplied. It raises an estoppel because the third party is given an assurance,\nwhich he relies on and would be inequitable for the principal to deny the\nauthority given. Apparent authority can legally be found, even though actually\nauthority has not been given.

[http://legal-\ndictionary.thefreedictionary.com/apparent+authority Legal Dictionary Entry on\nApparent Authority]. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so\nacts in the presence of the principal, and the principal stands silently and\nsays nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the\nauthority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a\nprincipal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third\nparties of this termination. This is called lingering apparent authority.\nBusiness owners can avoid being liable by giving public notice of the\ntermination of authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who\nwould have had reason to know of such authority.\n\nIn relation to companies, the apparent authority of directors, officers and\nagents of the company is normally referred to as \"ostensible authority.\"\nApparent authority issues also arise in the Fourth Amendment context, concerning\nwho has authority to consent to a search.
