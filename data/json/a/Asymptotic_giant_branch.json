The asymptotic giant branch is marked AGB in the case of a star of 2 solar\n  masses.]] The 'asymptotic giant branch' is the region of the Hertzsprung-\n  Russell diagram populated by evolving low to medium-mass stars. This is a\n  period of stellar evolution undertaken by all low to intermediate mass stars\n  (0.6â10 solar masses) late in their lives.\n\nObservationally, an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star will appear as a bright\nred giant with a luminosity thousands of times the sun. Its interior structure\nis characterized by a central and inert core of carbon and oxygen, a shell where\nhelium is undergoing fusion to form carbon (known as helium burning), another\nshell where hydrogen is undergoing fusion forming helium (known as hydrogen\nburning) and a very large envelope of material of composition similar to main\nsequence stars.
