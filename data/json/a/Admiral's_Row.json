[http://historicfortgreene.org/2007/07/admirals-row-and-army-\nnational-guard/ Admiral's Row], Fort Greene Association. Some of the\nhomes date back to the Civil War. Although the U.S. Navy closed the original\nNavy Yard in the mid-1960s, it continued to house some personnel in the\nofficersâ houses until the mid-1970s. The property is currently undergoing a\nSection 106 review by the National Guard. On April 15, 2008, they launched a\n[http://www.nan.usace.army.mil/business/buslinks/admiral/index.htm website] in\norder to invite public involvement in the proceedings. An open meeting was held\non July 23, 2008, from 7-9 PM, at which the public was asked to weigh in on the\npreservation of the structures. The results of that meeting are published on\nthe National Guard website, as well as considered in the Alternatives Report\nfor the site.\n\nAlthough Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation president Andrew Kimball has\nclaimed that the residences have been damaged beyond repair by the elements, the\n[http://www.nan.usace.army.mil/business/buslinks/admiral/pdf/report.pdf report]\nprepared by the United States Army Corps of Engineers refutes this claim,\nsuggesting that the residences are not only excellent candidates for\nrehabilitation, but meet all eligibility requirements for inclusion on the\nNational Register of Historic Places, both individually and as a district. The\nNew York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation has\n[http://www.nan.usace.army.mil/business/buslinks/admiral/pdf/letterNRHP.pdf\nagreed] with this assessment and has suggested that alternatives to demolition,\nincluding adaptive reuse, must be considered.\n\nThe property on which the Row stands encompasses approximately . Some of the\nresidences are divided into two or three units. The designations of the\nbuildings, along Flushing Avenue from West (Navy Street) to East, are:\n\n# A timber shed Quarters K, Quarters L Quarters H, Quarters C Quarters B\n# Quarters D Quarters E, Quarters F, Quarters G Quarters I\n\nAlso on the grounds are:\n* A tennis court\n* A greenhouse\n* Garages for each resident\n* Quarters J, a mostly collapsed house belonging to the groundskeeper\n  for the Row\n\nQuarters A, the Commandant's residence, was not located on the Row. Of the\nstructures on the Row, Quarters B is the most intricately styled and is\ncurrently in the best condition of any of the residences. Quarters B was the\nhome of Admiral Matthew C. Perry while he was the commandant (titled Commodore)\nof the New York Navy Yard. An evaluation is currently underway to determine\nwhether quarters B & D may be attributed to architect Thomas U. Walter, who\ndesigned the Kirkbride structure at St. Elizabeths Hospital, as suggested by\nthe report.\n\nIn November 2011 the City Council approved a plan to rehabilitate the more\nstable buildings for retail space, and demolish the unstable ones.
