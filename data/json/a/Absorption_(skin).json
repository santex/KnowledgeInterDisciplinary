{"cursor":"1238","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nSkin 'absorption' is a route by which substances can enter the body through the\nskin. Along with inhalation, ingestion and injection, dermal absorption is a\nroute of exposure for toxic substances and route of administration for\nmedication. Absorption of substances through the skin depends on a number of\nfactors, the most important of which are concentration, duration of contact,\n*solubility of medication*, and physical condition of the skin and part of the\nbody exposed. Substances called carriers help other substances penetrate the\nskin to make them more readily absorbed. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a carrier\nthat is frequently used to transport medication through the skin. This allows\ntreatment to be localized, unlike with ingestion. Alongside that, certain\nmedications seem to be more effective (or are more efficient) using this route\nof administration, while it still remains clear that others are not.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Absorption_(skin)","recorded":1362890787,"links":12,"instances":["medicine","pharmacokinetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Skin physiology"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["injection","medicine"],["absorption","pharmacokinetics"]],"members":["injection","absorption"],"related":["Skin","Inhalation","Ingestion","Injection_(medicine)","Dermis","Route_of_administration","Medication","Concentration","Solubility","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)"]}
