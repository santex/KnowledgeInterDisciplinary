{"cursor":"7431","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Aurora programme' is a human spaceflight programme of the European Space\nAgency (ESA) established in 2001 with the primary objectives of creating, and\nthen implementing, a European long-term plan for exploration of the Solar System\nusing robotic spacecraft and human spaceflight. A secondary objective is to\nsearch for life beyond the Earth. \n\nMember states commit to participation in the Aurora programme for five-year\nperiods (the first is 2005-2009), after which they can change their level of\nparticipation or pull out entirely.\n\nIn the early years the Aurora Programme planned for flagship missions such as\nExoMars and NEXT., and arrow missions for key\ntechnology demonstrations, such as Earth re-entry vehicle/capsule and Mars\naerocapture demonstrator.\n\nIn recent years ESA has increasingly used the name 'Aurora Exploration\nProgramme', or simply 'Exploration Programme'. Although human spaceflight has\nremained a long-term goal of the programme, with some basic technology\ndevelopment in this area, the thrust has been on implementation of the\nExoMars mission and preparations for an international Mars Sample Return\nMission. Due to funding shortages on both sides of the Atlantic, these plans\nfor robotic exploration of Mars are currently (2011) increasingly made in\ncooperation with NASA.\n\nAt a meeting in Plymouth on 29-30 June 2009, ESA and NASA created a Mars\nExploration Joint Initiative (MEJI) with the aim of planning collaborative Mars\nmissions for 2016, 2018 and 2020, and leading to the return of samples from Mars\nin the 2020s. Space News, ISSN 1046-6940, Volume 20, Issue 28, 2009 July 13,\npage 4 The previous main effort of the Aurora Programme, the ExoMars\nmission, is not explicitly part of the MEJI collaboration and unlikely to be\nimplemented as originally foreseen, but major parts of its science instruments\nare likely to be embedded in the MEJI collaboration. However, the Italian Space\nAgency (ASI), a major financer of the Aurora programme, has voiced scepticism\nregarding the proposed MEJI collaboration, in particular its lack of independent\nEuropean demonstration of key capabilities for future planetary\nexploration. Space News, ISSN 1046-6940, Volume 20, Issue 30, 2009 July 27,\npage 6\n\nThe Aurora programme has currently two planned missions, possibly in\ncollaboration with the Russian Federal Space Agency. These are planned for\nlaunch in 2016 and 2018.
