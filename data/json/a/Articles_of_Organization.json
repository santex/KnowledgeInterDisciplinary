{"cursor":"1444","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Articles of Organization' is a document similar to the articles of\nincorporation, outlining the initial statements required to form an LLC at the\nState level a limited liability company. It is a necessary document for setting\nup an LLC in many US states.\n\nSome States refer to articles of organization as a certificate of organization.\nMost Secretaries of State provide fill-in-the-blank PDF templates to file with\nthe State. Some people use the services of an attorney to draft articles of\norganization. Articles must be drafted to meet the State requirements to form a\nLLC. Regardless of what the Articles promulgate, the LLC is bound by the\nspecific State laws that it is formed under. A common misconception is that LLCs\nformed by improper articles of organization do not have the limitation of\nliability protection allowed by the State. If the State statute allows for\nlimitation of the members' and managers' liability, the said members and\nmanagers are covered under that protection regardless of what articles of\norganization state.\n\nFor terms of similar meaning in other countries, see [[articles of\nassociation]].\n","linknr":84,"url":"Articles_of_Organization","recorded":1362576003,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Corporations law","United States law"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Articles_of_incorporation","Limited_liability_company","United_States_of_America","PDF"]}
