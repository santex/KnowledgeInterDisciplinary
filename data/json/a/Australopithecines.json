{"cursor":"3763","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" __NOTOC__\n\nThe term 'australopithecine' refers generally to any species in the related\ngenera [[Australopithecus]] (some of which are sometimes placed in\n[[Praeanthropus]]) and [[Paranthropus]] (sometimes synonymized with\n[[Australopithecus]]). This may also include [[Kenyanthropus]]. These genera\noccurred in the Plio-Pleistocene era, and were bipedal and dentally similar to\nhumans, but with a brain size not much larger than modern apes, with lesser\nencephalization than in the genus [[Homo]].\n\nThey are classified within the 'Australopithecina' subtribe of the Hominini\ntribe. They appeared in the Pliocene:\n\n* Australopithecus, appeared about 4 million years ago;\n* Kenyanthropus, appeared about 3.5 million years ago.\n* Paranthropus, appeared about 2.7 million years ago.\n\nWhen used alone, the term refers to these genera together. Australopithecus is\nsometimes referred to as the \"gracile (slender) australopithecines\", while\nParanthropus are also called the \"robust australopithecines\". Larry L Mai; Marcus Young Owl; M Patricia Kersting, (2005). While\nthere are spedific discussions of these terms, description and definition of is\nfound throughout the text, as they relate to various fossils and taxonomic\ndebates, etc.\n\nA possible ancestor of the australopithecines is the genus [[Ardipithecus]],\nwhich lived in East Africa. The genus [[Homo (genus)|Homo]] (humans, which\nappear about 2.4 million years ago with [[Homo habilis]]) may be descended from\naustralopithecine ancestors.\n","linknr":217,"url":"Australopithecines","recorded":1362373280,"links":32,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/lectures/evolutionary-anatomy/Australopithecines.pdf"],"categories":["Human evolution","Pliocene","Homininae"],"headings":["See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Australopithecus_sediba.JPG/220px-Australopithecus_sediba.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tribe","biology"]],"members":["tribe"],"related":["Genus","Synonym","Plio-Pleistocene","Bipedal","Encephalization","Hominini","Tribe_(biology)","Pliocene","Human","Human_taxonomy"]}
