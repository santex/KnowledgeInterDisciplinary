The ANS affects\nheart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, salivation, perspiration, pupillary\ndilation, micturition (urination), and sexual arousal. Most autonomous functions\nare involuntary but a number of ANS actions can work alongside some degree of\nconscious control. Everyday examples include breathing, swallowing, and sexual\narousal, and in some cases functions such as heart rate.\n\nWithin the brain, the ANS is located in the medulla oblongata in the lower\nbrainstem. The medulla's major ANS functions include respiration (the\nrespiratory control centre, or \"rcc\"), cardiac regulation (the cardiac control\ncentre, or \"ccc\"), vasomotor activity (the vasomotor centre or \"vmc\"), and\ncertain reflex actions (such as coughing, sneezing, vomiting and swallowing).\nThese then subdivide into other areas and are also linked to ANS subsystems and\nnervous systems external to the brain. The hypothalamus, just above the brain\nstem, acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving ANS regulatory\ninput from the limbic system to do so. [http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/research/allostatic/parasym.php\nAllostatic load notebook: Parasympathetic Function] - 1999, MacArthur research\nnetwork, UCSF\n\nThe ANS is classically divided into two subsystems: the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem (PSNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS)  which operate\nindependently in some functions and interact co-operatively in others. In many\ncases the two have \"opposite\" actions where one activates a physiological\nresponse and the other inhibits it. An older simplification of the sympathetic\nand parasympathetic nervous systems as \"excitory\" and \"inhibitory\" was\noverturned due to the many exceptions found. A more modern characterisation is\nthat the sympathetic nervous system is a \"quick response mobilising system\" and\nthe parasympathetic is a \"more slowly activated dampening system\", but even this\nhas exceptions, such as in sexual arousal and orgasm where both play a role. The enteric nervous system is also sometimes considered part\nof the autonomic nervous system, and sometimes\nconsidered an independent system.\n\nANS functions can generally be divided into sensory (afferent) and motor\n(efferent) subsystems. Within both there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses\nbetween neurons. Relatively recently, a third subsystem of neurons that have\nbeen named 'non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic' neurons (because they use nitric\noxide as a neurotransmitter) have been described and found to be integral in\nautonomic function, particularly in the gut and the lungs.\n","linknr":759,"url":"Autonomic_nervous_system","recorded":1362373624,"links":63,"instances":["eye","heart"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Autonomic nervous system|*"],"headings":["Anatomy","Function","Neurotransmitters and pharmacology","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["accommodation","eye"],["ventricle","heart"]],"members":["accommodation","ventricle"],"related":["Peripheral_nervous_system","Control_system","Consciousness","Viscera","Heart_rate","Digestion","Respiratory_rate","Salivation","Perspiration","Pupillary_dilation","Micturition","Sexual_arousal","Conscious_control","Biofeedback","Heart_rate","Brain","Medulla_oblongata","Brainstem","Breathing","Control_of_respiration","Heart","Vasomotor","Vasomotor_centre","Reflex","Coughing","Sneezing","Vomiting","Swallowing","Nervous_system","Hypothalamus","Regulatory","Limbic_system","UCSF","Parasympathetic_nervous_system","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Dampening","Sexual_arousal","Orgasm","Enteric_nervous_system","Inhibitory","Excitatory","Synapses","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Parasympathetic_nervous_system","Lateral_horn_of_spinal_cord","Paravertebral_ganglia","Cervical_Ganglia","Thoracic_Ganglia","Lumbar_Ganglia","Sacral_Ganglia","Prevertebral_ganglia","Chromaffin_cells","Brainstem","Parasympathetic_ganglia","Vagus_nerve","Submandibular_ganglion","Enteric_nervous_system","Central_nervous_system","Dorsal_motor_nucleus_of_the_vagus_nerve","Nucleus_ambiguus","Fight-or-flight_response","Fight_or_flight_response","Skin","Skeletal_muscle","Lung","Heart_rate","Contractility","Myocytes","Coronary_vessels","Heart","Sphincters","Peristalsis","Orgasm","Vagus","Accessory_nerve","Parasympathetic","Heart","Myocardium","Accommodation_(eye)","Peristalsis","Pelvic_splanchnic_nerves","Noradrenaline","Cotransmitters","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adrenergic_receptors","Acetylcholine","Adrenal_medulla","Nicotinic_receptors","Adrenaline","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Cardiac_output","Β1_receptor","Β2_receptor","M2_receptor","SA_node","Chronotropic","Β1_receptor","Β2_receptor","Heart_atrium","Cardiac_muscle","Inotropic","AV_node","Electrical_conduction_system_of_the_heart","Cardiac_muscle_automaticity","Atrioventricular_block","Ventricle_(heart)","Cardiac_muscle","Inotropic","Cardiac_muscle_automaticity","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Vascular_smooth_muscle","M3_receptor","Renal_artery","Coronary_arteries","Coronary_arteries","Arteries","Viscera","Arteries","Skin","Arteries","Brain","Arteries","Erectile_tissue","Arteries","Salivary_gland","Hepatic_artery","Arteries","Skeletal_muscle","Vein","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Platelets","Α2_receptor","Mast_cells","Histamine","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Smooth_muscles","Bronchioles","Alpha-1_adrenergic_receptor","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Pupil_dilator_muscle","Α1_receptor","Mydriasis","Iris_sphincter_muscle","Miosis","Ciliary_muscle","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Salivary_glands","Amylase","Potassium","Lacrimal_glands","Juxtaglomerular_apparatus","Kidney","Renin","Parietal_cells","Gastric_acid","Liver","Glycogenolysis","Gluconeogenesis","Adipose","Lipolysis","GI_tract","Smooth_muscle","Sphincters","GI_tract","Glands","GI_tract","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Pancreas","Islets_of_Langerhans","Insulin","Beta_cell","Glucagon","Alpha_cell","Adrenal_medulla","Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor","Acetylcholine","Epinephrine","Norepinephrine","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Detrusor_urinae_muscle","Urinary_bladder","Internal_sphincter_muscle_of_urethra","Adrenergic","Muscarinic","Uterus","Genitalia","Ejaculation","Adrenergic","Sweat_gland","Arrector_pili"]}
