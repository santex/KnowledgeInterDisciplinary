He served as the head football coach at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (1909â1912), Purdue University (1913â1915), and the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley (1916â1925), compiling a career college\nfootball record of 116â32â13. As head coach of the California Golden Bears\nfootball program, Smith guided his \"Wonder Teams\" to a record of 74â16â7,\ncaptured five Pacific Coast Conference titles, and claimed three national\nchampionships. Smith was the winningest football coach in school history until\nhe was surpassed by Jeff Tedford in 2011. He was inducted into the College\nFootball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951.\n","linknr":260,"url":"Andy_Smith_(American_football)","recorded":1375081007,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Andy_Smith_(American_football)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Andy_Smith_(American_football)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Andy_Smith.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Andy_Smith.jpg/220px-Andy_Smith.jpg","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/Du_Bois,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Penn_Quakers_football","/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)","/wiki/Head_coach","/wiki/Penn_Quakers_football","/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_football","/wiki/California_Golden_Bears_football","http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=2167","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Conference","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=20090","/wiki/American_football","/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania","/wiki/Purdue_University","/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley","/wiki/College_football","/wiki/California_Golden_Bears_football","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Conference","/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS","/wiki/Jeff_Tedford","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","#Coaching_career","#Quotes","#Head_coaching_record","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Andy_Smith_(American_football)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Roaring_Twenties","/wiki/Knute_Rockne","/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame","/wiki/1920_Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football_team","/wiki/Rose_Bowl_Game","/wiki/Helms_Athletic_Foundation","/wiki/NCAA","/wiki/Washington_%26_Jefferson_Presidents_football","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Penn_Quakers_football","/wiki/California_Memorial_Stadium","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","/w/index.php?title=Andy_Smith_(American_football)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Andy_Smith_(American_football)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Penn_Quakers_football","/wiki/1909_college_football_season","/wiki/1910_college_football_season","/wiki/1911_college_football_season","/wiki/1912_college_football_season","/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_football","/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference","/wiki/1913_college_football_season","/wiki/1914_college_football_season","/wiki/1915_college_football_season","/wiki/California_Golden_Bears_football","/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Conference","/wiki/1916_college_football_season","/wiki/1917_college_football_season","/wiki/1918_college_football_season","/wiki/1919_college_football_season","/wiki/1920_college_football_season","/wiki/1920_California_Golden_Bears_football_team","/wiki/1921_Rose_Bowl","/wiki/1921_college_football_season","/wiki/1921_California_Golden_Bears_football_team","/wiki/1922_Rose_Bowl","/wiki/1922_college_football_season","/wiki/1923_college_football_season","/wiki/1924_college_football_season","/wiki/1925_college_football_season","/w/index.php?title=Andy_Smith_(American_football)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/cal/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/pdf-07FB151to190-072007","/w/index.php?title=Andy_Smith_(American_football)&action=edit&section=5","http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=20090","/wiki/College_Football_Hall_of_Fame","http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_year_by_year.php?coachid=2167","/wiki/College_Football_Data_Warehouse","/wiki/Template:Penn_Quakers_football_coach_navbox","/wiki/Template_talk:Penn_Quakers_football_coach_navbox","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Penn_Quakers_football_coach_navbox&action=edit","/wiki/Penn_Quakers_football","/wiki/Frank_Dole","/wiki/Woody_Wagenhorst","/wiki/George_Washington_Woodruff","/wiki/Carl_S._Williams","/wiki/Sol_Metzger","/wiki/George_H._Brooke","/wiki/Bob_Folwell","/wiki/John_Heisman","/wiki/Lou_Young","/wiki/Lud_Wray","/wiki/Harvey_Harman","/wiki/George_Munger_(American_football)","/wiki/Steve_Sebo","/wiki/John_Stiegman","/wiki/Bob_Odell_(American_football)","/w/index.php?title=Harry_Gamble&action=edit&redlink=1","/w
