There are three physiological\ndevelopments that must occur in order for this to take place: firstly, the\nplant must pass from sexual immaturity into a sexually mature state (i.e. a\ntransition towards flowering); secondly, the transformation of the apical\nmeristemâs function from a vegetative meristem into a floral meristem or\ninflorescence; and finally the growth of the flowerâs individual organs. The\nlatter phase has been modelled using the 'ABC model', which endeavours to\ndescribe the biological basis of the process from the perspective of molecular\nand developmental genetics.\n\nAn external stimulus is required in order to trigger the differentiation of the\nmeristem into a flower. This stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the\nmeristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same\nstimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that\nwill lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems.\nThe main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious\ndisparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled)\nphyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls\nor verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development,\ngiving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from\nvegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is Â«determinedÂ», which\nmeans that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.\n\nThe identity of the organs present in the four floral verticils is a consequence\nof the interaction of at least three types of gene products, each with distinct\nfunctions. According to the ABC model, functions A and C are required in order\nto determine the identity of the verticils of the perianth and the reproductive\nverticils, respectively. These functions are exclusive and the absence of one of\nthem means that the other will determine the identity of all the floral\nverticils. The B function allows the differentiation of petals from sepals in\nthe secondary verticil, as well as the differentiation of the stamen from the\ncarpel on the tertiary verticil.\n\nGoetheâs Â«foliar theoryÂ» was formulated in the 18th century and it suggests that\nthe constituent parts of a flower are structurally modified leaves, which are\nfunctionally specialized for reproduction or protection. The theory was first\npublished in 1790 in the essay \"Metamorphosis of Plants\" (\"Versuch die\nMetamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklaren\"). Dornelas, M.C.; Dornelas,\nO. 2005.
