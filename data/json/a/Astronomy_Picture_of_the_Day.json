[http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090607.html APOD for June 7, 2009]\n]] 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' ('APOD') is a website provided by NASA and\nMichigan Technological University (MTU). According to the website, \"Each day a\ndifferent image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief\nexplanation written by a professional astronomer.\" The photograph\ndoes not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is\ndisplayed, and images are sometimes repeated. However,\nthe pictures and descriptions are often related to current events in astronomy\nand space exploration. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and\nwebsites for more information. The images are either photographs, images taken\nat other wavelengths and displayed with false colors, video footage, animations\nor artistâs conceptions. Past images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the\nfirst image appearing on June 16, 1995. This initiative has received support\nfrom NASA, the National Science Foundation, and MTU. The images are sometimes\nauthored by people or organizations outside of NASA, and therefore APOD images\nare often copyrighted, unlike many other NASA image galleries.\n\nWhen APOD began it received only 14 pages views on its first day. As of 2012 it\nis estimated that there have been over 1 billion image views. APOD is\nalso translated into 21 languages daily.\n\nAPOD was presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in\n1996. Its practice of using hypertext was\nanalyzed in a paper in 2000. It received a [[Scientific American]]\nSci/Tech Web Award in 2001. In 2002, the website was featured in an\ninterview with Nemiroff on CNN Saturday Morning News. In 2003, the\ntwo authors published a book titled The Universe: 365 Days The Universe: 365\nDays: Robert J. Nemiroff, Jerry T. Bonnell: Books from Harry N. Abrams,\nwhich is a collection of the best images from APOD as a hardcover \"coffee table\"\nstyle book. APOD was the Featured Collection in the November 2004 issue of [[D-\nLib Magazine]].\n","linknr":180,"url":"Astronomy_Picture_of_the_Day","recorded":1362268022,"links":23,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["NASA online","Astronomy education","Photography websites","Internet properties established in 1995"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/APOD_2012_July_24_South_Polar_Vortex_Discovered_on_Titan.png/225px-APOD_2012_July_24_South_Polar_Vortex_Discovered_on_Titan.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/WholeEros.jpg/240px-WholeEros.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mirror","computing"]],"members":["mirror"],"related":["NASA","Michigan_Technological_University","Robert_Nemiroff","Jerry_Bonnell","NEAR_Shoemaker","Website","NASA","Michigan_Technological_University","Photograph","Universe","Astronomer","Space_exploration","Wavelengths","False-color","National_Science_Foundation","Copyright","American_Astronomical_Society","Hypertext","CNN","Harry_N._Abrams","Coffee_table_book","Mirror_(computing)"]}
