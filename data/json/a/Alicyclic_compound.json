{"cursor":"2071","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is the smallest alicyclic compound.]] An 'alicyclic compound' is an organic\n compound that is both aliphatic and cyclic. They contain one or more all-carbon\n rings which may be either saturated or unsaturated, but do not have aromatic\n character. Alicyclic compounds may have one or more aliphatic side\n chains attached.\n\nThe simplest alicyclic compounds are the monocyclic cycloalkanes: cyclopropane,\ncyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, and so on.\nBicyclic alkanes include bicycloundecane and decalin. Polycyclic alkanes include\ncubane, basketane, and housane.\n\nSpiro compounds have two or more rings that are connected through only one\ncarbon atom.\n\nThe mode of ring-closing in the formation of many alicyclic compounds can be\npredicted by Baldwin's rules.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Alicyclic_compound","recorded":1362674242,"links":28,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic compounds","Organic chemistry"],"headings":["Cycloalkenes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Cyclopropane.png/150px-Cyclopropane.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Cyclohexene_structures.svg/220px-Cyclohexene_structures.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Exocyclic.png/200px-Exocyclic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["saturation","chemistry"]],"members":["saturation"],"related":["Organic_compound","Aliphatic_compound","Cyclic_compound","Saturation_(chemistry)","Aromaticity","Cycloalkane","Cyclopropane","Cyclobutane","Cyclopentane","Cyclohexane","Cycloheptane","Cyclooctane","Bicyclic_molecule","Bicycloundecane","Decalin","Polycyclic_compound","Cubane","Basketane","Housane","Spiro_compound","Baldwin's_rules","Cycloalkene","Cyclopropene","Cyclobutene","Cyclopentene","Cyclohexene","Cycloheptene","Cyclooctene","Norbornene","Norbornadiene","Methylenecyclohexane","1-methylcyclohexene","Isotoluene","Bredt's_rule"]}
