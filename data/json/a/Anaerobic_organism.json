It could possibly react negatively and may even die if oxygen\nis present. Most such species are unicellular microbes, though some are near-\nmicroscopic metazoa and some deep-sea worms. Some largely unicellular anaerobic\nmicrobes are protists, but most of the anaerobic microbes are bacteria or\nArchaea. For practical purposes there are three categories: *obligate anaerobes,\nwhich cannot use oxygen for growth and are even harmed by it *aerotolerant\norganisms, which cannot use oxygen for growth, but tolerate the presence of it\n*facultative anaerobes, which can grow without oxygen but can utilize oxygen if\nit is present In human beings these organisms are usually found in the\ngastrointestinal tract.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Anaerobic_organism","recorded":1362500394,"links":46,"instances":["environmental","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biodegradation","Biodegradable waste management","Cellular respiration","Medically important anaerobes|","Microbiology"],"headings":["Metabolism","Culturing anaerobes","Antibiotic Potency","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Anaerobic.png/300px-Anaerobic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fermentation","biochemistry"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["fermentation","biochemistry"]],"members":["hypoxia","fermentation"],"related":["Obligate_aerobe","Obligate_anaerobe","Facultative_anaerobic_organism","Microaerophile","Organism","Oxygen","Animal","Worm","Protist","Bacteria","Archaea","Obligate_anaerobe","Facultative_anaerobic_organism","Human_gastrointestinal_tract","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Anaerobic_respiration","Aerobic_respiration","Glucose","Adenosine_diphosphate","Lactic_acid","Adenosine_triphosphate","Kilojoule_per_mole","Archaea","Propionic_acid","Butyric_acid","Butanediol_fermentation","Stickland_fermentation","Acetogenesis","Methanogenesis","Toxin","Tetanus","Glovebox","Sodium_borohydride","Sodium_bicarbonate","Thioglycollate_broth","Aerobic_organism","Anaerobic_infection","Anaerobic_digestion","Biogas","Digester","Facultative_anaerobic_organism","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Waste_management","Oxygen_catastrophe","Spinoloricus_Cinzia"]}
