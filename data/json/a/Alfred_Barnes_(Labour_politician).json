{"cursor":"4604","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Alfred John Barnes' PC (1887 – 26 November 1974) was a British Labour Co-\noperative politician.\n\nBorn in North Woolwich, he was the youngest child of William Barnes, a docker.\nBarnes lost a leg in a fairground accident at the age of 8. He was educated at\nthe Northampton Institute and the Central School of Arts and Crafts.\n\nBarnes worked originally as an artist in gold and silver. He\nwas an early member of the Independent Labour Party and was heavily involved in\nthe co-operative movement. He was chairman of the London Co-\noperative Society for nine years until 1923 and was a founder of the Co-\noperative Party. He became the Party's chairman in 1924 and\nserved until 1945. He was also a director and President of the National\nCooperative Publishing Society.\n\nIn November 1922, Barnes was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East\nHam South. In 1925 he was appointed a Labour Whip and served as a whip in\nGovernment, as Junior Lord of the Treasury. However, he was forced to resign\nin October 1930 - although his position as a director of the National\nCooperative Publishing Society was unpaid, parliamentary rules dictated that a\nminister cannot be a director of a public company (although they could be of a\nprivate company): Barnes chose to remain on the co-op board rather than as a\nwhip. Like many Labour MPs, he lost his seat in the 1931 general election but\nregained it in 1935.\n\nIn 1945, Barnes was made a Privy Counsellor and Minister of War Transport, later\nMinister of Transport, serving until the fall of the Labour government in\n1951. He stood down as a Member of Parliament at the 1955\ngeneral election.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)","recorded":1375075280,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Alfred_Barnes_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Labour_Co-operative","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/North_Woolwich","/wiki/City_University_London","/wiki/Central_Saint_Martins_College_of_Art_and_Design","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/Gold","/wiki/Silver","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party","/wiki/Co-operative","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/London_Co-operative_Society","/wiki/Co-operative_Party","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/Co-operative_Press","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/East_Ham_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Whip_(politics)","/wiki/Lord_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1931","/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Minister_of_War_Transport","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport","#cite_note-obit-1","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1955","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/The_Times","/wiki/Special:BookSources/184275033X","http://www.leighrayment.com/commons.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","#cite_ref-obit_1-0","#cite_ref-obit_1-1","#cite_ref-obit_1-2","#cite_ref-obit_1-3","#cite_ref-obit_1-4","#cite_ref-obit_1-5","/wiki/The_Times","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Allen_Clement_Edwards","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/East_Ham_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1922","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1931","/wiki/Malcolm_Campbell-Johnston","/wiki/Malcolm_Campbell-Johnston","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/East_Ham_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1935","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1955","/wiki/Albert_Oram,_Baron_Oram","/wiki/Frederick_Leathers,_1st_Viscount_Leathers","/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Transport","/wiki/John_Maclay,_1st_Viscount_Muirshiel","/wiki/Co-operative_Party","/wiki/William_Coldrick","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/210134497","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)&oldid=517188575","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1887_births","/wiki/Category:1974_deaths","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Labour_Co-operative_MPs","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1922%E2%80%931923","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1923%E2%80%931924","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1924%E2%80%931929","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1929%E2%80%931931","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1935%E2%80%931945","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1945%E2%80%931950","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1950%E2%80%931951","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1951%E2%80%931955","/wiki/Category:People_from_North_Woolwich","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP-MP_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alfred+Barnes+%28Labour+politician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alfred+Barnes+%28Labour+politician%29","/wiki/Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)","/wiki/Talk:Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)","#","/wiki/Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Barnes_(Labour_politician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Spe
