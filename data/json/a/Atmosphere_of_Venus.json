The\ntemperature at the surface is 740 K (467 Â°C, 872 Â°F), while the pressure is\n93 bar. The Venusian atmosphere supports opaque\nclouds made of sulfuric acid, making optical Earth-based and orbital observation\nof the surface impossible. Information about the topography has been obtained\nexclusively by radar imaging. The main atmospheric\ngases are carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Other chemical compounds are present only\nin trace amounts.\n\nMikhail Lomonosov was the first person to hypothesize the existence of an\natmosphere on Venus based on his observation of the transit of Venus of 1761 in\na small observatory near his house in Petersburg.\n\nThe atmosphere is in a state of vigorous circulation and super-rotation. The whole atmosphere circles the planet in just four Earth\ndays, much faster than the planet's sidereal day of 243 days. The winds\nsupporting super-rotation blow as fast as 100 m/s (~220 mph or\n360 km/h). Winds move at up to 60 times the speed of\nthe planet's rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% rotation\nspeed. On the other hand, the wind speed becomes increasingly slower\nas the elevation from the surface decreases, with the breeze barely reaching the\nspeed of 10 km/h on the surface. DK Space Encyclopedia: Atmosphere of\nVenus p 58. Near the poles are anticyclonic structures called polar\nvortices. Each vortex is double-eyed and shows a characteristic S-shaped pattern\nof clouds.\n\nUnlike Earth, Venus lacks a magnetic field. Its ionosphere separates the\natmosphere from outer space and the solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the\nsolar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is\nconsidered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour,\nare continuously blown away by the solar wind through the induced\nmagnetotail. It is speculated that the atmosphere of\nVenus up to around 4 billion years ago was more like that of the Earth with\nliquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by\nthe evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other\ngreenhouse gases.\n\nDespite the harsh conditions on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and\ntemperature at about 50 km to 65 km above the surface of the planet is\nnearly the same as that of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-\nlike area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the\nsimilarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21%\noxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a\nlifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for\nboth exploration and colonization.\n\nOn January 29, 2013, ESA scientists reported that the ionosphere of the planet\nVenus streams outwards in a manner similar to \"the ion tail seen streaming from\na comet under similar conditions.\"\n","linknr":1229,"url":"Atmosphere_of_Venus","recorded":1362371878,"links":60,"instances":["rover","rover","fictitious","unit","probe","planet","chemistry","physics","organisms","unit","geology","unit","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2002/TM-2002-211467.pdf","http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2002/TM-2002-211467.pdf","http://www.gaerospace.com/press-releases/pdfs/Robotic_balloon.pdf","http://www.gaerospace.com/press-releases/pdfs/Robotic_balloon.pdf"],"categories":["Venus","Planetary
