It is usually responsible for a particular geographic area. An army\n group is the largest field organization handled by a single commanderâusually a\n full General or Field Marshalâand it generally includes between 400,000 and\n 1,000,000 soldiers.\n\nIn the Polish Armed Forces and former Soviet Red Army an army group was known as\na Front. The equivalent of an army group in the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) was\na General Army ().\n\nArmy groups may be multi-national formations. For example, during World War II,\nthe Southern Group of Armies (also known as the U.S. 6th Army Group) comprised\nthe U.S. Seventh Army and the French First Army; the 21st Army Group comprised\nthe British Second Army, the Canadian First Army and the US Ninth Army.\n\nIn U.S. Army usage, the number of an army group is expressed in Arabic numerals\n(e.g., \"12th Army Group\"), while the number of an army is spelled out (e.g.,\n\"Third Army\").\n","linknr":298,"url":"Army_group","recorded":1362477195,"links":48,"instances":["wwii","united_states","united_kingdom"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Army groups"],"headings":["World War II","NATO 'Army Groups'","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Latvian_platoon_at_Camp_Lejune.jpg/220px-Latvian_platoon_at_Camp_Lejune.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Army_group_Nato.svg/200px-Army_group_Nato.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/NORTHAG.gif/100px-NORTHAG.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["front","soviet_army"],["front","soviet_army"],["front","soviet_army"],["front","soviet_army#list_of_soviet_fronts_in_world_war_ii"],["first_polish_army","1944-1945"],["operation_quicksilver","wwii"],["i_corps","united_kingdom"],["vii_corps","united_states"]],"members":["front","operation_quicksilver","vii_corps","i_corps","first_polish_army"],"related":["Front_(Soviet_Army)","Military","Field_army","General_Officer","Field_Marshal","Polish_Armed_Forces","Red_Army","Front_(Soviet_Army)","Imperial_Japanese_Army","World_War_II","U.S._6th_Army_Group","U.S._Seventh_Army","French_First_Army","21st_Army_Group","British_Second_Army","Canadian_First_Army","US_Ninth_Army","Zhang_Zizhong","Hubei","List_of_German_Army_Groups_in_WWII","Army_Group_Africa","Kwantung_Army","Garrison","Kwantung_Leased_Territory","China","Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria","China_Expeditionary_Army","Nanjing","Southern_Expeditionary_Army_Group","Saigon","French_Indochina","South_Asia","South_East_Asia","Oceania","General_Defense_Command","Tokyo","Hiroshima","Surrender_of_Japan","Front_(Soviet_Army)","First_Polish_Army_(1944-1945)","1st_Belorussian_Front","Allied_Forces_Headquarters","Mediterranean_Theatre_of_World_War_II","15th_Army_Group","Western_Allies","European_Theatre_of_World_War_II","Chief_of_Staff_Supreme_Allied_Command","Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Forces","Dwight_D._Eisenhower","European_Theater_of_Operations_United_States_Army","21st_Army_Group","12th_Army_Group","First_United_States_Army_Group","6th_Army_Group","Operation_Dragoon","Allied_Force_Headquarters","Operation_Quicksilver_(WWII)","South_East_Asia_Command","South-East_Asian_theatre_of_World_War_II","11th_Army_Group","West_Germany","Allied_Forces_Central_Europe","Warsaw_Pact","Globalsecurity.org","Northern_Army_Group","Central_Army_Group","I_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","British_Army_of_the_Rhine","United_States_V_Corps","VII_Corps_(United_States)","West_Germany","U.S._Seventh_Army","Heidelberg","Mönchengladbach"]}
