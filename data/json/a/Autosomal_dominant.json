{"cursor":"33577","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Dominance}} 'Dominance' in genetics is a relationship between alleles of a gene,\nin which one allele masks the expression (phenotype) of another allele at the\nsame locus.  In the simplest case, where a gene exists in two allelic\nforms (designated A and B), three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are\npossible: AA, AB, and BB. If AA and BB individuals (homozygotes) show different\nforms of the trait (phenotype), and AB individuals (heterozygotes) show the same\nphenotype as AA individuals, then allele A is said to dominate or be dominant to\nor show dominance to allele B, and B is said to be recessive to A. If instead AB\nhas the same phenotype as BB, B is dominant to A.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Autosomal_dominant","recorded":1362482066,"links":43,"instances":["cat","biology","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics"],"headings":["Background","Nomenclature","Relationship to other genetic concepts","Molecular mechanisms","Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans","Dominant-negative mutations","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Autosomal_dominant_-_en.svg/220px-Autosomal_dominant_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Co-dominance_Rhododendron.jpg/220px-Co-dominance_Rhododendron.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Codominant.jpg/220px-Codominant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["siamese","cat"],["siamese","cat"],["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["hybrid","biology"]],"members":["siamese","hybrid","transcription","locus"],"related":["Genetics","Alleles","Gene","Allele","Phenotype","Allele","Locus_(genetics)","Genotypes","Zygosity","Phenotype","Zygosity","Chromosome","Ploidy","Ovum","Sperm","Fertilization","Ploidy","Gametes","Meiosis","Locus_(genetics)","Genes","Allele","DNA","Homozygote","Heterozygote","Genotype","Phenotype","ABO_blood_group_system","Siamese_(cat)","Albinism","Birman","Siamese_(cat)","Albinism","Four_o'clock_flower","Antigen","Antigens","HBB","Hemoglobin","Protein_electrophoresis","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA","Mammal","Sex-determination_system","X_chromosome","Y_chromosome","Autosome","Sex_linkage","Zygosity","Testis_determining_factor","Androgenic_alopecia","Epistasis","Genotype","Bases","Nucleotide","DNA","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation","Protein_isoform","Enzyme","Allozyme","Mutation","Albinism","Melanin","HBB","Globin","Hemoglobin","Red_blood_cells","Anemia","Sickle-cell_anemia","Sickle-cell_trait","Trinucleotide_repeat","Huntington_Disease","Phenylketonuria","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Phenylalanine","Central_nervous_system","Mental_retardation","Hyperphenylalaninemia","Apoptosis","P53","Ataxia_telangiectasia_mutated","CEBPA","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_gamma","Gregor_Mendel","Hybrid_(biology)","Mitochondrial_DNA","Sex_linkage","Evolution_of_dominance","List_of_Mendelian_traits_in_humans","Huntington's_Disease_Outreach_Project_for_Education_at_Stanford"]}
