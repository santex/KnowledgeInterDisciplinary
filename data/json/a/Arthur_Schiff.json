{"cursor":"4134","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Arthur Schiff' (1 May 1940 â 24 August 2006) was one of least known but most\ninfluential promoters of American kitsch products.\n\nSchiff ran his own company and ingenious marketing campaigns for 23 years.\nDuring his long career in advertising, he produced over 1800 direct response TV\ninfomercials, including the Steakhouse Onion Machine, Ambervision Sunglasses and\nthe Shiwala car mop. One of the most famous products worked on by Schiff is the\nline of Ginsu knives, during his three-year term of employment as Creative\nDirector at legendary direct marketing firm Dial Media, founded By Ed Valenti\nand Barry Becher in 1975, in Warwick, Rhode Island.\n\nSchiff's commercials gained a degree of notoriety for their effective use of\ncatchphrases, including his signature creation \"But wait, there's more!\" He also\ncoined several other widely used and often parodied phrases used in infomercials\ntoday, including \"Isn't that amazing?\" \"Isn't that a Clever [[Meat\ncleaver|Cleaver]]!\" and \"Act now and you'll also receive ... \"\n\nThe history of the Ginsu product line can be traced back to 1978, when Schiff's\nemployer Edward Valenti was looking for the best way to market a line of\n\"ordinary\" kitchen knives with the rather dull brand name \"Quikut\". Working as\npart of a creative team that included Valenti and Becher, Schiff rebranded this\nproduct as Ginsu. Schiff recalled some years later, \"I went to sleep that night,\nstill wrestling with the problem,\" he wrote, in typically fervid style. \"And\nthen it happened! I bolted out of bed at three o'clock in the morning and\nyelled, 'Eureka! I've got it. Ginsu!' I wrote the bizarre word down on a piece\nof paper and went back to sleep. When I got up again four hours later, the paper\nwas still there and that strange word was still on it. I stuffed it into my\nshirt pocket and headed off to work.\"\n\nThe combination of Schiff's unusual Japanese sounding name for the knives with\nproduct demonstrations and copy lines previously developed by Valenti and\nBecher, many of which had been used to sell their first three multi-million\nselling products (Miracle Painter, Miracle Duster and Miracle Slicer) on TV\nprior to Schiff's employment, seemed to launch Ginsu to an even higher level of\nsuccess and consumer retention.\n\nMuch like the ice cream brand HÃ¤agen-Dazs, the Ginsu name was nonsense, but\nnevertheless extremely effective in associating the product image as a \"samurai\nsword\" for the kitchen. The partners (Valenti and Becher) hired a local Japanese\nexchange student to appear as a chef. The most famous Ginsu television\nadvertisement began with a hand karate-chopping a two-by-four board. According\nthe opening copy co-written by Valenti and Schiff, \"In Japan, the hand can be\nused like a knife. But this method doesn't work with a tomato\" (cut to Valenti's\nhand karate chopping...and squashing...a tomato).\n\nSchiff died of lung cancer in Coral Springs, Florida in 2006.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Arthur_Schiff","recorded":1363425142,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Kitsch","/wiki/Infomercial","/wiki/Blooming_onion","/wiki/Sunglasses","/wiki/Car_washing","/wiki/Ginsu","/wiki/Kitchen_knife","/w/index.php?title=Dial_Media&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Ed_Valenti","/wiki/Barry_Becher","/wiki/Warwick,_Rhode_Island","/wiki/Catchphrase","/wiki/Meat_cleaver","/wiki/Japanese_language","/wiki/Product_demonstration","/wiki/Ice_cream","/wiki/H%C3%A4agen-Dazs","/wiki/Samurai","/wiki/Exchange_student","/wiki/Karate","/wiki/Lumber#Dimensional_lumber","/wiki/Japan","/wiki/Tomato","/wiki/Lung_cancer","/wiki/Coral_Springs,_Florida","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Ron_Popeil","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&action=edit&section=2","http://www.washpost.com","http://www.startribune.com/484/story/652593.html","http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/01/AR2006090101777.html","http://www.epolitics.com/2006/09/02/death-of-an-ad-man/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&oldid=540113923","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1940_births","/wiki/Category:2006_deaths","/wiki/Category:Direct_marketing","/wiki/Category:Deaths_from_lung_cancer","/wiki/Category:People_from_Coral_Springs,_Florida","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arthur+Schiff&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Arthur+Schiff","/wiki/Arthur_Schiff","/wiki/Talk:Arthur_Schiff","#","/wiki/Arthur_Schiff","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Arthur_Schiff","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Arthur_Schiff","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&oldid=540113923","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Arthur_Schiff&id=540113923","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Arthur+Schiff","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Arthur+Schiff&oldid=540113923&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Schiff&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schiff","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1940
