Within these contexts, it is the capacity of a rational\nindividual to make an informed, un-coerced decision. In moral and political\nphilosophy, autonomy is often used as the basis for determining moral\nresponsibility for one's actions. One of the best known philosophical theories\nof autonomy was developed by Kant. In medicine, respect for the autonomy of\npatients is an important goal of deontology, though it can conflict with a\ncompeting ethical principle, namely beneficence. Autonomy is also used to refer\nto the self-government of the people.\n","title":"Autonomy","headings":["Sociology","Politics","Philosophy","Religion","Medicine","International human rights law","Space systems","Various uses","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Philosophy","2: Kant","2: Medicine","2: Autonomism","2: Informed_consent","2: Convention_on_the_Rights_of_Persons_with_Disabilities","2: Robotics","2: Territorial_autonomy","1: Ancient_Greek","1: Law","1: Concept","1: Morality","1: Political","1: Bioethics","1: Rationality","1: Individual","1: Deontology","1: Primum_non_nocere","1: People","1: Sociology","1: Sociology_of_knowledge","1: Controversy","1: Science_and_technology_studies","1: Reflexive_autonomy","1: Scientific","1: Anarchism","1: Philippine_Islands","1: Filipino_people","1: Sovereign","1: Indigenous_people","1: Kuna_people","1: Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation","1: Globalization","1: Moral_philosophy","1: Duty","1: Dignity","1: Free_will","1: Determinism","1: Church_polity","1: Orthodox_Church","1: Archbishop","1: Metropolitan_bishop","1: Patriarch","1: Mother_church","1: Medical_ethics","1: Shared_decision_making","1: Doctors'_Trial","1: Medical_research","1: Therapeutic_relationship","1: Decision-making","1: Bodily_integrity","1: Forced_feeding","1: Eating_disorder","1: Anorexia","1: Psychotic_disorder","1: Anti-psychotic_medication","1: The_Yogyakarta_Principles","1: International_human_rights_law","1: Reproductive_rights","1: Gender_identity","1: Treaty","1: Cybernetics","1: Unmanned_aerial_vehicle","1: Peripheral","1: Self-determination_theory","1: Ordinary_differential_equation","1: Linguistics","1: Autonomous_language","1: Autonomous_robot","1: Spaceflight","1: Economics","1: Autonomous_consumption","1: Politics","1: Self-determination","1: Independence","1: Sovereignty","1: Anti-establishment","1: Activism","1: Autonomous_space","1: Social_center","1: Social_psychology","1: Sociotropy","1: Equality_of_autonomy","1: Direct_democracy","1: Self-Determination_Theory","1: Cornelius_Castoriadis","1: Takis_Fotopoulos","1: Teaching_for_social_justice","1: Viable_System_Model","1: Self-governing_colony","1: Sui_iuris","1: Home_Rule"]}
