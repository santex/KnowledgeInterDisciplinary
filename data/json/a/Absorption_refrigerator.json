{"cursor":"12277","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'absorption refrigerator' is a refrigerator that uses a heat source (e.g.,\nsolar, kerosene-fueled flame, waste heat from factories or district heating\nsystems) to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling system.\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using\nwater-ammonia systems was popular and widely used but, after the development of\nthe vapor compression cycle, it lost much of its importance because of its low\ncoefficient of performance (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression\ncycle). Nowadays, the vapour absorption cycle is used only where waste heat is\navailable or where heat is derived from solar collectors. Absorption\nrefrigerators are a popular alternative to regular compressor refrigerators\nwhere electricity is unreliable, costly, or unavailable, where noise from the\ncompressor is problematic, or where surplus heat is available (e.g., from\nturbine exhausts or industrial processes, or from solar plants).\n\nFor example, absorption refrigerators powered by heat from the combustion of\nliquefied petroleum gas are often used for food storage in recreational\nvehicles. Absorptive refrigeration can also be used to air-condition buildings\nusing the waste heat from a gas turbine or water heater. This use is very\nefficient, since the gas turbine produces electricity, hot water and air-\nconditioning (called trigeneration).\n\nBoth absorption and compressor refrigerators use a refrigerant with a very low\nboiling point (less than ). In both types, when this refrigerant evaporates\n(boils), it takes some heat away with it, providing the cooling effect. The main\ndifference between the two types is the way the refrigerant is changed from a\ngas back into a liquid so that the cycle can repeat. An absorption refrigerator\nchanges the gas back into a liquid using a different method that needs only\nheat, and has no moving parts. In comparison, a compressor refrigerator uses\nan electrically powered compressor to increase the pressure on the gas, and then\ncondenses the hot high pressure gas back to a liquid by heat exchange with a\ncoolant (usually air). Once the high pressure gas has cooled and condensed into\na liquid, it passes through an orifice which creates a pressure drop, which\ncauses the liquid to evaporate. The evaporation process absorbs heat, and the\ntemperature of the refrigerant drops to its boiling point at the (now) low\npressure. The other difference between the two types is the refrigerant\nused. Compressor refrigerators typically use an HCFC or HFC, while absorption\nrefrigerators typically use ammonia or water.\n\nThe standard for the absorption refrigerator is given by the ANSI/AHRI standard\n560-2000.
