{"cursor":"19891","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Enneagram}} The 'Enneagram of Personality' (or simply the 'Enneagram', from the\nGreek words ennea [nine] and gramma [something written or drawn]) is a model of\nhuman personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected\npersonality types. Principally developed by Oscar Ichazo and Claudio Naranjo, it\nis also partly based on earlier teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff. The typology\ndefines nine personality types (sometimes referred to as \"enneatypes\"), which\nare represented by the points of a geometric figure called an enneagram, which also indicates some of the connections between the\ntypes. As there are different schools of thought among Enneagram theorists about\nsome aspects of how it is understood, its interpretation is not always unified\nor consistent.\n\nThe Enneagram of Personality is not a typology that is commonly taught or\nresearched in academic psychology. It has been widely promoted in both business\nmanagement and spiritual contexts through seminars, conferences, books,\nmagazines and DVDs. In business\ncontexts it is generally used as a typology to gain insights into workplace\ndynamics; in spirituality it is more commonly presented as a path to higher\nstates of being, essence and enlightenment. It has been described as a method\nfor self-understanding and self-development but has been\ncriticized as being subject to interpretation, making it difficult to test or\nvalidate scientifically.\n","linknr":324,"url":"Achiever","recorded":1362684071,"links":44,"instances":["philosophy","deadly_sin","spiritual","geometry","concept"],"pdf":["http://www.awarenesstoaction.com/downloads/the_instincts.pdf"],"categories":["Enneagram","Enneatypes","Personality typologies"],"headings":["History","Enneagram figure","Nine types","Roman Catholic criticism","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Enneagram_integration.JPG/220px-Enneagram_integration.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["enneagram","geometry"],["enlightenment","spiritual"],["enneagram","geometry"],["authenticity","philosophy"],["vengeance","concept"],["sloth","deadly_sin"]],"members":["authenticity","sloth","enlightenment","enneagram","vengeance"],"related":["Personality_type","Oscar_Ichazo","Claudio_Naranjo","G._I._Gurdjieff","Personality_types","Enneagram_(geometry)","Psychology","Being","Essence","Enlightenment_(spiritual)","Evagrius_Ponticus","G._I._Gurdjieff","Oscar_Ichazo","Protoanalysis","Arica_Institute","Claudio_Naranjo","Don_Richard_Riso","Richard_Rohr","Elizabeth_Wagele","Enneagram_(geometry)","Risoâ€“Hudson_Enneagram_Type_Indicator","Archetypal","Resentment","Hypocrisy","Hypercriticism","Anger","Flattery","Psychological_manipulation","Pride","Humility","Vanity","Deceit","Truthfulness","Authenticity_(philosophy)","Melancholy","Envy","Equanimity","Avarice","Cowardice","Fear","Courage","Planning","Gluttony","Sobriety","Vengeance_(concept)","Lust","Innocence","Laziness","Sloth_(deadly_sin)","Jesuits","A._H._Almaas","Personality_psychology","Riso-Hudson_Enneagram_Type_Indicator","Tritype","Ingrid_Stabb"]}
