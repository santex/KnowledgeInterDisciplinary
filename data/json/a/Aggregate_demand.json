While this is correct at the\nmicroeconomic, single good level, at the aggregate level this is incorrect. The\naggregate demand curve is in fact downward sloping as a result of three distinct\neffects: Pigou's wealth effect, the Keynes' interest rate effect and the Mundell-\nFleming exchange-rate effect.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Aggregate_demand","recorded":1362562516,"links":36,"instances":["economics","economics","economics","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.mises.org/books/failureofneweconomics.pdf","http://www.mises.org/books/failureofneweconomics.pdf"],"categories":["Macroeconomic aggregates","Demand"],"headings":["History","Components","Aggregate demand curves","Debt","Criticisms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/4/854cc0fb9ec1ffa14821237035147374.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/6/3161976361b830118b3b73fd24f09ba1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/7/d/b7d46f2951ba57c8adb33d03fafeaf8e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/9/e/09e2781a05bfb8eb8ea17d9fb0e81f02.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/4/7/a4745b3db5b0c52d8fc318335e14dc32.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/b/05b74f5ffc30dd93876920d7c5790559.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/1/f71277dbb6dda720f087627e3783b109.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/b/a/0bacd09e5e818719c43dcb9bb3a43c0e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/0/c/00cdb941882eaaad1587eb37a23443a0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/AS_%2B_AD_graph.svg/300px-AS_%2B_AD_graph.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gross","economics"],["output","economics"],["deflation","economics"],["reproduction","economics"]],"members":["reproduction","deflation","output","gross"],"related":["Macroeconomics","Price_level","Gross_domestic_product","Inventory","Effective_demand","Pigou_effect","Keynes_effect","Mundellâ€“Fleming_model","Great_Depression","Wall_Street_Crash","Involuntary_unemployment","Marginal_propensity_to_consume","Velocity_of_money","Real_vs._nominal_in_economics","Consumption_function","Autonomous_consumption","Marginal_propensity_to_consume","Gross_(economics)","Investment","Factory","Private_sector","Consumable","Keynesian","National_Income_and_Product_Accounts","Interest_rate","Government","Net_worth","Exports","Macrovariables","Microvariables","Currency","Marshallian_demand","Supply_and_demand","GDP_deflator","Money","Real_vs._nominal_in_economics","Interest_rate","Keynes_effect","Theory","Supply_and_demand","Aggregate_supply","Output_(economics)","Inflation","Real_vs._nominal_in_economics","Gross_domestic_product","Keynesian_economics","Potential_output","Deflation_(economics)","Post-Keynesian","Debt","Steve_Keen","Recession","Vicious_cycle","Debt-deflation","Irving_Fisher","Credit_bubble","Financial_crises","Deficit_spending","Debt_relief","Austrian_School","Henry_Hazlitt","Friedrich_Hayek","Aggregate_supply","Aggregation_problem","Reproduction_(economics)"]}
