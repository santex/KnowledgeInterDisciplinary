{"cursor":"8084","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Arvid Pardo' (February 12, 1914 â June 19, 1999) was a Maltese diplomat,\nscholar, and university professor. He is known as the \"Father of the Law of the\nSea Conference\".\n\nPardo was born in Rome. His Maltese father died of typhus while on a relief\nmission in the Soviet Union in 1922. His Swedish mother died a year later during\nan appendectomy and his brother was killed in an automobile accident. He became\nthe ward of his uncle, Italian diplomat , who served as Ambassador to Brazil,\nthe Soviet Union, Germany and the Vatican. Attolico sent him to school at\nCollegio Mondragone, Frascati, and the young Pardo spent his vacations with\nAttolico at the latter's various diplomatic posts.\n\nPardo spoke Italian, English, French, Swedish and Spanish fluently, and knew\nGerman fairly well. As a student in pre-war Rome, he met Margit Claeson, a\nSwedish textile designer. In 1947, once his finances were secure, he went to\nSweden to find her (they had lost touch during the war) and married her. They\nhad three children: Christina (1949, m. Menez), Lars (1950) and David (1951),\nall educated in England. His wife and children all outlived him.\n\nPardo received a degree in diplomatic history from the University of Tours,\nFrance in 1938 and a doctorate in international law from the University of Rome\nin 1939. When World War II began, he commenced underground activities as an anti-\nFascist organizer but was arrested by the Italian authorities in 1940. After the\nfall of Benito Mussolini's government, he was freed in September 1943, but was\nre-arrested at once by the Gestapo and kept in Alexanderplatz Prison, Berlin\nunder a sentence of death. In 1945, as the Red Army approached Berlin, the Swiss\nofficials and the International Committee of the Red Cross arranged his release.\nAfter the Soviets entered Berlin, Pardo was arrested again and interrogated.\nOnce released, he crossed the Elbe, walking to the Allied lines, and made\ncontact with British and American forces. He was sent to London, where he\narrived penniless. Both New York Times articles\n\nAt first Pardo worked as a dishwasher and waiter in a London restaurant chain\nuntil he sought out a friend of his father's, David Owen, who was then helping\nto set up the United Nations in London. Owen hired him as an assistant in the\ndocumentary section, and despite holding a doctorate, he worked as a junior\nclerk in charge of archives in 1945â6. He then served in the Department of\nTrusteeship and Non-Self-Governing Territories until 1960. He then joined the\nSecretariat of the Technical Assistance Board (forerunner of the UNDP) and\nserved as deputy representative in Nigeria and Ecuador, where he was stationed\nbefore being selected in 1964 as the first Permanent Representative of Malta to\nthe United Nations by the newly-independent country that he had visited only\nbriefly during his life.\n\nDuring his time as UN delegate, which ended in 1971 after Dom Mintoff's return\nto office, Pardo's lasting achievement was his work to reform the law of the\nsea. On 1 November 1967, he made an electrifying speech before the General\nAssembly calling for international regulations to ensure peace at sea, to\nprevent further pollution and to protect ocean resources. He proposed that the\nseabed constitutes part of the common heritage of mankind, a phrase that appears\nin Article 136 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the\nSea, and asked that some of the seaâs wealth be used to bankroll a\nfund that would help close the gap between rich and poor nations. [http://w-\nww.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/winter99/alumninews/alumninews_mbd.html USC\ndeath notice]. It was Pardo who initiated the fifteen-year process that\nwould culminate in 1982, when the Convention was opened for signatures, and in\nthe early years, he continued a dedicated effort to promote the issue, for\ninstance helping achieve near-unanimous passage of GA Resolution 2749 on\nDecember 17, 1970. This resolution embodied principles regarding the seabed and\nits resources that would later be incorporated into the\nConvention. [http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v7n2/mwenda72.txt Deep\nSea-Bed Mining Under Customary International Law]. Pardo was unhappy with\nthe final instrument's provision for an Exclusive Economic Zone, lamenting that\nthe common heritage of mankind had been whittled down to \"a few fish and a\nlittle seaweed\". [http://www.cwps.org/old/global56.htm#c Center for\nWar/Peace Studies Global Report].\n\nFrom 1967 to 1971, Pardo was also Malta's Ambassador to the United States.\nDuring the same period served as Ambassador to the USSR and was High\nCommissioner to Canada from 1969 to 1971. He was Maltaâs representative at the\nPreparatory Commission of the Law of the Sea conference in 1972 and led the\nMaltese delegation to the UN Seabed Committee from 1971 to 1973.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1975 Pardo was coordinator of the ocean studies program at the\nWoodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. From 1975\nto 1990 he was on the USC faculty, teaching political science (1975â81) and\ninternational relations (1981â90). For those fifteen years, he was a senior\nfellow at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Studies.\n\nPardo was made a Knight of Malta in 1992. He was resident in Seattle when he\ndied there in 1999 \"In Memoriam.\" (some sources claim he was living in\nHouston and died there) [http://www.scienceblog.com/c-\nommunity/older/archives/L/1999/B/un991103.html Death notice].
