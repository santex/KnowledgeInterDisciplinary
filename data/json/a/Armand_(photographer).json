{"cursor":"3169","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Armenak Arzrouni' (1901â1963), who worked under the mononym 'Armand', was an\nArmenian photographer based in Egypt.\n\nBorn in August 1901 in Erzurum, then part of the Ottoman Empire, he came with\nhis father to Alexandria, Egypt in 1907. At school, he had a passion for\ndrawing. He started working as an apprentice under Nadir, a photographer based\nin Alexandria. In 1925, he went to Cairo as an assistant to Zola, an Austrian\nJewish photographer and renowned portraitist, at his studio in Ard el-Sherif,\nnear Midan Mustafa Kamel street. Zola sent Arzrouni to Austria to learn about\nthe colorization of black-and-white photographs, as well as airbrush technique\nand the use of charcoal and chalk. Upon Zola's death in 1930, Arzrouni opened\nhis own studio in Midan Mustafa Kamel under the name Armand Studio. His father\nbuilt him a giant enlarger capable of handling negatives with large dimensions.\nBy the mid-1950s, his first studio was threatened with destruction, so he opened\na second studio in 1956, in Talaat Harb street. He specialized in portrait\nphotography, and took photographs of politicians, film stars, famous cabaret\ndancers, as well as members of the royal family. The 1952 Revolution did not\nhinder his career, and he continued to take photographs of famous people,\nnotably Gamal Abdel Nasser and foreign heads of state visiting Egypt. He was\nespecially well known for the elaborate settings of his wedding photographs. He\nalso occasionally received orders for photographs of hotels and department\nstores. His son Armand worked as his assistant as early as 1960, and took over\nthe studio after his father's death in 1963. He signs his photographs in the\nsame way as his father.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Armand_(photographer)","recorded":1374522752,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:ModernEgypt,_Queen_Nariman,_DHP13655-18-9_01.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/ModernEgypt%2C_Queen_Nariman%2C_DHP13655-18-9_01.jpg/220px-ModernEgypt%2C_Queen_Nariman%2C_DHP13655-18-9_01.jpg","/wiki/File:ModernEgypt,_Queen_Nariman,_DHP13655-18-9_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mononymous_person","/wiki/Armenians","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Erzurum","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Alexandria","/wiki/Apprenticeship","/wiki/Austrian_Jews","/wiki/Austria","/wiki/Airbrush","/wiki/Charcoal","/wiki/Chalk","/wiki/Photographic_studio","/wiki/Enlarger","/wiki/Negative_(photography)","/wiki/Portrait_photography","/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Dynasty","/wiki/Egyptian_Revolution_of_1952","/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser","/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Armand_(photographer)","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-2-7427-2252-5","/wiki/OCLC","//www.worldcat.org/oclc/41529732","http://www.acam-france.org/bibliographie/auteur.php?cle=zaatari-akram","/wiki/Help:CS1_errors#accessdate_missing_url","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/69801750","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Armenia.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Flag_of_Armenia.svg/30px-Flag_of_Armenia.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Armenia-artist-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Armenia-artist-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Armenia-artist-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Gnome-dev-camera.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Gnome-dev-camera.svg/35px-Gnome-dev-camera.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Photographer-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Photographer-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Photographer-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&oldid=546481683","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Armenian_people_stubs","/wiki/Category:European_artist_stubs","/wiki/Category:Photographer_stubs","/wiki/Category:1901_births","/wiki/Category:1963_deaths","/wiki/Category:Armenian_photographers","/wiki/Category:Egyptian_Armenians","/wiki/Category:Expatriate_photographers_in_Egypt","/wiki/Category:Ottoman_Armenians","/wiki/Category:People_from_Erzurum","/wiki/Category:Portrait_photographers","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_same_as_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Category:Pages_using_citations_with_accessdate_and_no_URL","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Armand+%28photographer%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Armand+%28photographer%29","/wiki/Armand_(photographer)","/wiki/Talk:Armand_(photographer)","#","/wiki/Armand_(photographer)","/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Armand_(photographer)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Armand_(photographer)","/wiki/Special:Recen
