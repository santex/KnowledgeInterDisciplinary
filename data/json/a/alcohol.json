{"cursor":"37425","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n of the hydroxyl (OH) functional group in an alcohol molecule. The three \"R's\"\n stand for carbon substituents or hydrogen atoms.]]\n\nIn chemistry, an 'alcohol' is an organic compound in which the hydroxyl\nfunctional group (-O H) is bound to a carbon atom. In particular, this carbon\ncenter should be saturated, having single bonds to three other atoms.\n\nAn important class of alcohols are the simple acyclic alcohols, the general\nformula for which is C nH 2n+1 OH. Of those, ethanol\n(C 2H 5OH) is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic\nbeverages, and in common speech the word alcohol refers specifically to ethanol.\n\nOther alcohols are usually described with a clarifying adjective, as in\n[[isopropyl alcohol]] (propan-2-ol) or wood alcohol (methyl alcohol, or\nmethanol). The suffix -ol appears in the IUPAC chemical name of all substances\nwhere the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in\nsubstances where a higher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- will\nappear in the IUPAC name. The suffix -ol in non-systematic names (such as\nparacetamol or cholesterol) also typically indicates that the substance includes\na hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol. But many\nsubstances, particularly sugars (examples glucose and sucrose) contain hydroxyl\nfunctional groups without using the suffix.\n\nIn everyday life \"alcohol\" without qualification usually refers to ethanol, or a\nbeverage based on ethanol (as in the term \"alcohol abuse\").\n","linknr":-1,"url":"alcohol","recorded":1372152738,"links":[],"instances":["chemistry","biochemistry","chemistry","chemistry","molecule","cosmetics","chemistry","grammar","biochemistry","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Alcohols|*","Antiseptics","Functional
