ATP is the most\ncommonly used \"energy currency\" of cells from most organisms. It is formed\nfrom adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P i), and\nneeds energy.\n\nThe overall reaction sequence is: ADP + P i â ATP, where ADP and\nP i are joined together by ATPsynthase\n\nEnergy is often released in the form of protium or , moving down an\nelectrochemical gradient, such as from the lumen into the stroma of chloroplasts\nor from the inter-membrane space into the matrix in mitochondria.\n","linknr":656,"url":"ATP_synthase","recorded":1362505023,"links":42,"instances":["fluid"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzymes","Cellular respiration","Photosynthesis","EC 3.6.3","Integral membrane proteins"],"headings":["Structure","Binding-change model","Physiological role","Evolution of ATP synthase","ATP synthase in different organisms","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Atp_synthase.PNG/300px-Atp_synthase.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Mitochondrie.svg/300px-Mitochondrie.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/ATPsyn.gif/220px-ATPsyn.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stroma","fluid"]],"members":["stroma"],"related":["Enzyme","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_diphosphate","Phosphate","Energy","Hydrogen-1","Electrochemical_gradient","Chloroplast","Mitochondrion","Mitochondria","Nomenclature","Oligomycin","Oligomycin","Submitochondrial_particle","ATP_synthase_alpha/beta_subunits","ATP5A1","ATPAF2","ATP_synthase_alpha/beta_subunits","ATP5B","ATPAF1","C16orf7","ATP_synthase_gamma_subunit","ATP5C1","ATP_synthase_delta_subunit","ATP5D","ATP_synthase_","ATP5E","ATP5H","ATP5I","ATP5J2","ATP5L","MT-ATP8","ATP_synthase_subunits_A","ATP6","ATP_synthase_subunit_B","ATP5F1","ATP_synthase_subunit_C","ATP5G1","ATP5G2","ATP5G3","Paul_D._Boyer","John_E._Walker","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Jens_Christian_Skou","Protein_subunit","Proton","ATP_synthase_subunit_C","Rotating_locomotion_in_living_systems","ATP_synthase_subunit_C","Electron_cryo-microscopy","Dissociation_constant","Proton","Gradient","Flagella","Bacteria","Electrochemical_potential","Electron_transfer_chain","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Mitochondria","Evolution","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign","V-ATPase","V-ATPase","DNA_helicase","Flagellum","ATP_synthase,_H+_transporting,_mitochondrial_F1_complex,_alpha_1","ATP5AL1","ATP5B","ATP5BL1","ATP5C2","ATP5D","ATP5E","ATP5F1","ATP5G1","ATP5G2","ATP5G3","ATP5H","ATP5HP1","ATP5I","ATP5J","ATP5J2","ATP5L","ATP5L2","ATP5O","ATP5S","ATP_synthase_chain_A","ATP6AP1","ATP6AP2","ATPSBL1","ATPSBL2","MT-ATP6","MT-ATP8","Chloroplasts","Thylakoid","Stroma_(fluid)","Calvin_cycle","Electrochemical_potential","ATP_synthase_alpha/beta_subunits","ATP_synthase_delta_subunit","ATP_synthase_gamma_subunit","ATP_synthase_subunit_C","ATP10_protein","V-ATPase","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Mitochondrion","Chloroplast","Electron_transfer_chain","Proton_pump","Transmembrane_ATPase","Flavoprotein","P-ATPase","Rotating_locomotion_in_living_systems","University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign"]}
