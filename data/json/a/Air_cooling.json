{"cursor":"5852","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" V8 has a lot of heatpipes.]] 'Air cooling' is a method of dissipating heat. It\n works by making the object to be cooled have a larger surface area or have an\n increased flow of air over its surface, or both. An example of the former is to\n add fins to the surface of the object, either by making them integral or by\n attaching them tightly to the object's surface (to ensure efficient heat\n transfer). In the case of the latter it is done by using a fan blowing air into\n or onto the object one wants to cool. In many cases the addition of fins adds\n to the total surface area making a heatsink that makes for greater efficiency\n in cooling.\n\nIn all cases, the air has to be cooler than the object or surface from which it\nis expected to remove heat. This is due to the second law of thermodynamics,\nwhich states that heat will only move spontaneously from a hot reservoir (the\nheat sink) to a cold reservoir (the air).\n","linknr":138,"url":"Air_cooling","recorded":1362673464,"links":22,"instances":["mechanical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engine cooling systems","Cooling technology","Computer hardware cooling"],"headings":["Examples","Derating at high altitude","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Cooler_Master_V8.jpg/200px-Cooler_Master_V8.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/R68-opposed-cylinders.jpg/220px-R68-opposed-cylinders.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fan","mechanical"]],"members":["fan"],"related":["Heatpipe","Heat","Heatsink","Fan_(mechanical)","Air","Heatsink","History_of_BMW_motorcycles","CPU_cooling","Central_processing_unit","Electrical_insulation","Water_cooling","Industry","Air_conditioning","Brine","Heat_exchanger","Power_station","Computer_cooling","Computer_fan","Evaporative_cooling","Water_cooling","Oil_cooling","Heat_pipe","Peltier-Seebeck_effect","Heater_core","NACA"]}
