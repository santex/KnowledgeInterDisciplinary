Wirt, who headed the U.S. Office of Education in the early\ndays of the New Deal of President Franklin Roosevelt. Barrows had been a member\nof the Communist party since 1919, the same year she began working for the\nOffice of Education. During World War II Barrows was the Executive Secretary of\nthe National Council of American-Soviet Friendship.\n\nBorn in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Charles Dana Barrows and Marion\nMerrill, Alice graduated from Vassar College with an A.B. During 1901â03, she\nwas employed as an English teacher at the Packer Collegiate Institute, then she\ntaught English at the Ethical School in New York City from 1903â04. She became\nan English teacher at her alma mater until 1908 and was a graduate fellow of\nColumbia University. In 1909, Alice became a social investigator for the Russell\nSage Foundation. Two years later in 1911, she was named director of the\nVocational Education Survey.\n\nIn 1934, a Congressional Investigation was held to examine statements Dr. Wirt\nmade regarding a meeting in Alice Barrows home a year earlier. The \"Wirt\nIncident\" was widely reported and provoked much controversy. Barrows and several\nother government employees revealed to Wirt they were members of the Communist\nparty. Wirt testified,\n\n:\"I was told they believe that by thwarting our then evident economic recovery,\n:they would be able to prolong the countryâs destitution until they had\n:demonstrated to the American people that the Government must operate business\n:and commerce. By propaganda, they would destroy institutions making long term\n:capital loansâand then push Uncle Sam into making these loans. Once Uncle Sam\n:becomes our financier, he must also follow his money with control and\n:management.\n\nWirt further testified they told him,\n\n:\"We believe we have Roosevelt in the middle of a swift stream, and that the\n:current is so strong, that he cannot turn back or escape from it. We believe\n:that we can keep Mr. Roosevelt there until we are ready to supplant him with a\n:Stalin. We all think that Mr. Roosevelt is only the Kerensky of this\n:revolution. We are on the inside. We can control the avenues of influence. We\n:can make the President believe that he is making decisions for himself.\"\n\nA June 1945 Venona project decryption of the Washington, D.C. KGB Office to\nMoscow's Eighth Department, the political intelligence wing, relayed information\non matters regarding President Truman and Attorney General Francis Biddle. KGB\nagent Charles Kramer, who served on the staff of several Senate Subcommittees,\nand Barrows are the sources of the information. Mary Van Kleek who headed the\nRussell Sage Foundation and also served on the Board of the National Council,\nvisited Washington weekly to meet with Barrows and Nathan Gregory Silvermaster.\n\nThe organization Barrows served as Director was found in 1953 to be a Communist\nfront organization by the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB). In its\nFindings of Fact, the SACB said the National Council of American-Soviet\nFriendship,\n:\"advances positions...markedly pro-Soviet and...anti-United States\n:Government...is a Communist-action organization which has as its primary\n:purpose to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement under the\n:hegemony of the Soviet Union; it has the policy to support and defend the\n:Soviet Union under any and all circumstances...We conclude that the National\n:Council of American-Soviet Friendship, Inc., is substantially directed,\n:dominated, and controlled by the Communist Party of the United States...and is\n:primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to...the Soviet\n:Union, a Communist foreign government.\".\"\n\nA. M. Barrows Elementary School in Reading, Massachusetts is named after\n   Alice Barrows.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Alice_Barrows","recorded":1375057968,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/VENONA_project","/wiki/Venona_project","/wiki/List_of_Americans_in_the_Venona_papers","/wiki/CPUSA","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Template:Ushistory&action=edit","/wiki/Secretary","/wiki/William_Albert_Wirt_(educationalist)","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education","/wiki/New_Deal","/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt","/wiki/Communist_party","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts","/wiki/Vassar_College","/wiki/Packer_Collegiate_Institute","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/Russell_Sage_Foundation","#cite_note-Leonard1914-1","/wiki/Joseph_Stalin","/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky","/wiki/World_Revolution","#endnote_73.2F2.2F4.2F10.2617.2F34","/wiki/VENONA_project","/wiki/KGB","/wiki/Harry_S._Truman","/wiki/Francis_Biddle","/wiki/Charles_Kramer_(economist)","/wiki/U.S._Congressional_subcommittee","/wiki/Russell_Sage_Foundation","/wiki/Nathan_Gregory_Silvermaster","#endnote_73.2F2.2F4.2F10.2617.2F34","/wiki/Communist_front","/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Hegemony","/wiki/Communist_Party_USA","#endnote_73.2F2.2F4.2F10.2617.2F34","/wiki/A._M._Barrows_Elementary_School","/wiki/Reading,_Massachusetts","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=edit&section=2","#endnote_73.2F2.2F4.2F10.2617.2F34","#endnote_73.2F2.2F4.2F10.2617.2F34","#endnote_73.2F2.2F4.2F10.2617.2F34","http://ets.umdl.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=usfexec;cc=usfexec;q1=Barrows;rgn=full%20text;idno=81242.0001.001;didno=81242.0001.001;view=image;seq=511;page=root;size=s;endseq=3;frm=frameset","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-Leonard1914_1-0","http://books.google.com/books?id=GvwUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Senate_Internal_Security_Subcommittee","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&oldid=553657928","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:United_States_Department_of_Education_officials","/wiki/Category:American_spies_for_the_Soviet_Union","/wiki/Category:American_people_in_the_Venona_papers","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_May_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alice+Barrows&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alice+Barrows","/wiki/Alice_Barrows","/wiki/Talk:Alice_Barrows","#","/wiki/Alice_Barrows","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Alice_Barrows","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Alice_Barrows","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&oldid=553657928","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4725742","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Alice_Barrows&id=553657928","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Alice+Barrows","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Alice+Barrows&oldid=553657928&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Alice_Barrows&printable=yes","#","//ww
