{"cursor":"35153","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Amino acid synthesis' is the set of biochemical processes (metabolic pathways)\nby which the various amino acids are produced from other compounds. The\nsubstrates for these processes are various compounds in the organism's diet or\ngrowth media. Not all organisms are able to synthesise all amino acids. For\nexample, humans are able to synthesise only 12 of the 20 standard amino acids.\n\nA fundamental problem for biological systems is to obtain nitrogen in an easily\nusable form. This problem is solved by certain microorganisms capable of\nreducing the inert Nâ¡N molecule (nitrogen gas) to two molecules of ammonia in\none of the most remarkable reactions in biochemistry. Ammonia is the source of\nnitrogen for all the amino acids. The carbon backbones come from the glycolytic\npathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, or the citric acid cycle.\n\nIn amino acid production, one encounters an important problem in biosynthesis,\nnamely stereochemical control. Because all amino acids except glycine are\nchiral, biosynthetic pathways must generate the correct isomer with high\nfidelity. In each of the 19 pathways for the generation of chiral amino acids,\nthe stereochemistry at the Î±-carbon atom is established by a transamination\nreaction that involves pyridoxal phosphate. Almost all the transaminases that\ncatalyze these reactions descend from a common ancestor, illustrating once again\nthat effective solutions to biochemical problems are retained throughout\nevolution.\n\nBiosynthetic pathways are often highly regulated such that building-blocks are\nsynthesized only when supplies are low. Very often, a high concentration of the\nfinal product of a pathway inhibits the activity of enzymes that function early\nin the pathway. Often present are allosteric enzymes capable of sensing and\nresponding to concentrations of regulatory species. These enzymes are similar in\nfunctional properties to aspartate transcarbamoylase and its regulators.\nFeedback and allosteric mechanisms ensure that all twenty amino acids are\nmaintained in sufficient amounts for protein synthesis and other processes.\n","linknr":725,"url":"Amino_acid_synthesis","recorded":1362371732,"links":22,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metabolism"],"headings":["Amino acid synthesis","Nitrogen fixation: Microorganisms use ATP and a powerful reductant to reduce atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia","Amino acids are made from intermediates of the citric acid cycle and other major pathways","Amino acid biosynthesis is regulated by feedback inhibition","Amino acids are precursors of many biomolecules","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Biochemical","Metabolic_pathways","Amino_acid","Chemical_compound","Organism","Nitrogen","Ammonia","Glycolytic_pathway","Pentose_phosphate_pathway","Citric_acid_cycle","Biosynthesis","Stereochemical","Glycine","Isomer","Transamination","Pyridoxal_phosphate","Catalyze","Evolution","Enzyme","Allosteric_enzyme","Aspartate_transcarbamoylase","Protein_synthesis","Ketoacids","Glutamate","Aminotransferase","Glutamate","Amination","Α-ketoglutarate","Alpha-Ketoglutaric_acid","Adenosine_triphosphate","Ferredoxin","Nitrogen","Amino_acids","Nucleotides","Glutamine","Glutamate","Selenocysteine","Arginine","Cysteine","Glycine","Glutamine","Histidine","Proline","Serine","Tyrosine","Essential_amino_acids","Alanine","Aspartate","Pyruvate","Oxaloacetate","Asparagine","Proline","Arginine","Serine","Glycine","Cysteine","Tyrosine","Phenylalanine","Tetrahydrofolate","Coenzyme","Adenosine","Homocysteine","Methionine","Cortisol","Feedback_inhibition","Enzyme","Glutamate","Citric_Acid_Cycle","Glutamine","Glutamine_synthetase","Nitrogen","Adenylation","Deadenylation","Ammonia","Manganese","Glutamine","Arginine","Gene","Aporepressor","Corepressor","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Tryptophan","Aromatic_amino_acids","Chorismate","Phosphoenolpyruvate","Shikimate_kinase","Tyrosine","Phenylalanine","Tryptophan","Chorismate","Prephenate","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Dehydrogenase","Phenylpyruvate","Anthranilate_synthase","Anthranilate_synthase","Chorismate","Lysine","Asparagine","Methionine","Threonine","Isoleucine","Aspartate","Threonine","Isoleucine","Amino_acids","Enzyme","Aspartokinase","Phosphorylation","Aspartate","Threonine","Lysine","Phosphorylation","Aspartic_acid","Threonine","Lysine","Lysine","Aspartokinase","Lysine","Threonine","Methionine","Phosphorylation","Lysine","Threonine","Dihydrodipicolinate_synthase","Asparagine","Bacteria","Protein","Operon","Methionine","Gene","Methionine","Vitamin_B12","Threonine","Homoserine","Threonine","Aspartate_kinase","Lysine","Isoleucine","Threonine","Lysine","Methionine","Threonine","Isoleucine","Chemical_reaction","Tryptophan","Histidine","TRNA","Ribosome","Ribosome","Serine","Glycine","Cysteine","Cell_(biology)","Bacterium","Glycine","Cysteine","Amino_acid","Sulfur","DNA","Sulfide","Thiosulfate","Glycolysis","Fermentation","Alanine","Valine","Catalyzed","Leucine","Valine","Leucine","Isoleucine","Glutathione","Glutathione_peroxidase","Hydrogen_peroxide","Nitric_oxide","Porphyrins","Succinyl_CoA","Porphobilinogen","Tetrapyrrole","Oxidation"]}
