Many more exhibitions have followed including the highly successful\n\"Dreams and Whispers\" show and \"The Dark Side\". She has since exhibited widely\nand now has work in many collections around the world including Germany,\nAustralia, America, Russia, Japan, New Zealand and the UK. She is a self taught\nartist, always preferring to explore her own ideas. She has worked with a\nvariety of media including oil, clay, charcoal, watercolour and pen and ink. She\nnow works mostly with pastel.\n\nHer dark moody pastel paintings are deeply involved with nature and its more\nmystical aspects, something which is most evident in her \"Earth Light Trees\".\nShe is perhaps best known for her \"Earth Light Trees\", an ongoing series of\npaintings which represents a central theme in her work, where trees, woodlands\nand forests glow with their own \"earth light\" and life force, symbolising the\npower and energy which the earth holds. Moonlight is also a dominant feature\nwith the moon in various phases providing an important part of the symbolism\nwhich runs throughout her paintings. She is also well known for her depiction of\nmany of the British megalithic sites, among them â Avebury, Stonehenge,\nWayland's Smithy and Castlerigg Stone Circle. Her inspiration comes from many\nthings including dreams, mysticism, nature, death, mythology and folklore. Her\npaintings are often described as gothic and her strange, haunting works,\nparticularly her moonlit scenes, have influenced many. She is also described as\na visionary artist.\n\nIn 2001 there was a large solo exhibition of her work in Cork Street, London at\nthe Gallery 27. In 2002 she won a Chesley award for her painting \"The Snow\nTree\". In 2004 there was a major solo exhibition of her work in London at the\nA&D Gallery. Also in 2004 she was a featured artist guest and art show judge at\nDragonCon in Atlanta. In 2006 there was an exhibition of her pastels and\ncharcoals at Cannizaro House in London. In May 2007 there was a major solo\nexhibition of her work in London at the Square One Gallery. In Spring 2008 she\nwas invited to exhibit at the famous Strawberry Hill House in London, home of\nHorace Walpole, who wrote the first Gothic novel \"Castle of Otranto\". In 2009\nshe exhibited at the Mall galleries, London and had a solo show at The Grey\nChapel Art Gallery, Glastonbury. In 2010 her \"Tiny Dreams\" exhibition was held\nin Lancashire. In 2011 she was approached by English Heritage who now stock\nprints and cards of her work. In October 2012 there was a major exhibition of\nher work at the SW1 Gallery in Mayfair her ninth solo London show. She has also\nexhibited at a number of art fairs including the Art on Paper Fair, London.\n\nAnne Sudworth's work is best described by Academy Award winning actor, Nicolas\nCage, who wrote: \"Anne Sudworth's art awakens the inner glow I felt as a child\nwhen I beheld a tree for the first time under moonlight. She recalls in me a\nsoft, light green illumination that restores my imagination; gives me strength\nin my adult life, and never stops burning no matter how dark the night gets.\nLike Graves' \"White Goddess\" her paintings are poetic, magical gifts direct from\nthe source.\" http://www.booksillustrated.com/exhibitions/anne-sudworth-out-of-\nthe-light/\n\nSudworth does not do illustration work and very rarely accepts commissions.
