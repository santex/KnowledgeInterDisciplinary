{"cursor":"40607","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Atomism' (from ancient Greek atomos, meaning \"uncuttable\") is a natural\nphilosophy that developed in several ancient traditions. The atomists theorized\nthat the natural world consists of two fundamental parts: indivisible 'atoms'\nand empty 'void'. Atoms are indestructible and immutable and there are an\ninfinite variety of shapes and sizes. They move through the void, bouncing off\neach other, sometimes becoming hooked with one or more others to form a cluster.\nClusters of different shapes, arrangements, and positions give rise to the\nvarious macroscopic substances in the world.

Further experiments showed that\nprotons and neutrons are made of quarks. At present, quarks, electrons, and\nother fundamental particles such as muons, taus, neutrinos, and gauge bosons\nshow no experimental evidence of size or substructure. However, the possibility\nthat they too might be composed of smaller particles cannot be ruled out.\nAlthough the connection to historical atomism is at best tenuous, these\nparticles, rather than chemical \"atoms\", are roughly analogous to the\ntraditional indivisible objects.\n","linknr":679,"url":"Atomism","recorded":1362891743,"links":64,"instances":["geometry","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy_of_mind","jainism","particle"],"pdf":["http://people.umass.edu/schaffer/papers/Fundamental.pdf"],"categories":["Natural philosophy","Hindu philosophical concepts","Indian philosophy","Nyaya","Empiricism","Epistemological theories","History of chemistry","History of ideas","History of philosophy","History of physics","Philosophy of science","Naturalism (philosophy)","Metaphysical theories","Philosophical movements"],"headings":["Philosophical atomism","Greek atomism","Indian atomism","Islamic atomism","Atomic renaissance","Atomic theory","See also","External links","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Tetrahedron.jpg/50px-Tetrahedron.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Octahedron.svg/50px-Octahedron.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Icosahedron.jpg/50px-Icosahedron.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Hexahedron.jpg/50px-Hexahedron.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tau","particle"],["mechanism","philosophy"],["cube","geometry"],["mechanism","philosophy"],["kalpasutra","jainism"],["dualism","philosophy_of_mind"],["mechanism","philosophy"],["mechanism","philosophy"],["becoming","philosophy"]],"members":["cube","mechanism","becoming","dualism","kalpasutra","tau"],"related":["Natural_philosophy","Atom","Vacuum","Aristotle","History_of_India","Ancient_Greece","India","Jain","Ajivika","Carvaka","Nyaya","Vaisheshika","Leucippus","Democritus","Chemists","Natural_philosophers","Electrons","Neutrons","Protons","Quarks","Fundamental_particle","Muon","Tau_(particle)","Neutrino","Gauge_boson","Atomic_theory","Reductionism","Mechanism_(philosophy)","Substance_theory","Classical_elements","India","Buddhist","Dharmakirti","Kalapas","Leucippus","Democritus","Heraclitus","Parmenides","Monism","Tetrahedron","Octahedron","Icosahedron","Cube_(geometry)","Plato","Mechanism_(philosophy)","Materialism","Cosmos","Corpuscularianism","Platonic_solid","Chatto_and_Windus","W._W._Norton_&_Company","Aristotle","Hylomorphism","Cambridge_University_Press","Chatto_and_Windus","W._W._Norton_&_Company","Epicurus","Nausiphanes","Lucretius","Sextus_Empiricus","University_of_Toronto_Press","Lucretius","Religion","Galen","Pierre_Gassendi","Descartes","Medieval_universities","Nicholas_of_Autrecourt","Al-Ghazali","Averroes","Light","Vedic_Sanskrit","Etymologist","Philologist","Yaska","Nyaya","Mimamsa","Buddhist","Pratishakhya","Bhartrihari","Mimamsa","Nyaya","Atom","Bhagavad_Gita","Diogenes_Laertius","Democritus","Gymnosophists","India","Nyaya","Vaisesika","Buddhist","Jainism","Will_Durant","Middle_Ages","Vedas","Nyaya","Vaisesika","Intensive_and_extensive_properties","Buddhism","Dharmakirti","Dignāga","Jainism","Pancastikayasara","Kalpasutra_(Jainism)","Tattvarthasutra","Jain_philosophy","Islamic_philosophy","Islamic_theology","Asharite","Islamic_theology","Al-Ghazali","Asharite","Occasionalism","Averroes","Scholasticism","Isaac_Newton","Epicurian","Aristotelian_physics","René_Descartes","Pierre_Gassendi","Robert_Boyle","Northumberland","Francis_Bacon","Sidereus_Nuncius","Giordano_Bruno","Thomas_Hobbes","Thomas_Hariot","Galileo_Galilei","Law_of_fall","René_Descartes","Mechanical_philosophy","Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind)","Pierre_Gassendi","Corpuscularianism","William_R._Newman","Alchemy","Robert_Boyle","Isaac_Newton","Corpuscular_theory_of_light","Robert_Boyle","The_Sceptical_Chymist","Mechanism_(philosophy)","Physical_sciences","Mechanism_(philosophy)","Scientific_demonstration","Roger_Boscovich","Lancelot_Law_Whyte","John_Dalton","Empirical_evidence","Hydrogen","Oxygen","Lavoisier","Analyzed","Chemical_analysis","Chemical_synthesis","Water","Ammonia","Nitrogen","Becoming_(philosophy)","History_of_chemistry","Infinite_divisibility","Ontological_pluralism","Physical_ontology","F._M._Cornford","Eduard_Jan_Dijksterhuis","G._E._R._Lloyd","G._E._R._Lloyd"]}
