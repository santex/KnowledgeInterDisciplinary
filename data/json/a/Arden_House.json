By the early nineteen hundreds\nthe family owned in the area, half of it comprising the Arden Estate. The main\nhouse is located at the top of a mountain east of the village, reachable by\nArden House Road from NY 17.\n\nOn September 17, 1886 Harriman bought at auction the Peter Parrott family estate\nfor $52,500, which was named Arden by the Parrott family after Mrs. Parrott's\nmaiden name. Over the next several years he purchased an additional , almost\nforty different parcels of land, and built forty miles of bridle paths. Harriman\nhired CarrÃ¨re and Hastings to design a home, which was begun in 1905. Harriman\nhad planned it for many years, but lived in it for only a few months before his\ndeath in 1909.\n\n\nThe house features a dramatic music room, modeled after a medieval great hall.\nAround the central courtyard is a brick corridor lined with murals by Barry\nFaulkner. Harriman commissioned a number of American artists to decorate the\nhouse. James Earle Fraser did a bas-relief portrait of Harriman over one of the\nfireplaces, as well as a fountain in the interior court; Malvina Hoffman did a\nbust of Mrs. Harriman; and Charles Cary Rumsey did a fountain of the Three\nGraces, a marble fireplace surround that featured a caricature of architect\nThomas Hastings, and corbel carvings of bighorn sheep in the music room. He also\nmanaged to marry Harriman's daughter, Mary, in 1910, much to the surprise of society.

Dann, Across the Great Border Fault: The Naturalist Myth in America\n(Rutgers University Press, 2000)]\n\nHarriman's widow gave the house to her son W. Averell Harriman upon his wedding\nin 1915, although she continued to live in the west wing of the building until\nher death in 1932. After the U.S. entered World War II, the family offered the\nhouse to the U.S. Navy, which turned it into the first of the Navy's\nconvalescent hospitals, modeled on those that England and Russia had already\nsuccessfully created.

In 1950,\nAverell Harriman and his brother Roland deeded the property to Columbia\nUniversity, as \"home of The American Assembly\", a public policy institution\nfounded by Dwight D. Eisenhower the same year. It became primarily used as a\ncenter for executive management programs. The house was identified as America's\nfirst conference center, and became a National Historic Landmark in 1966 |author=Richard Greenwood |date=December 17,\n1975|publisher=National Park Service|postscript= }} and  but is\nnot open to the public.\n\nIt was from this estate that Harriman's widow donated and one million dollars to\nNew York State to start Harriman State Park in 1910.\n\nIn 2007, the Open Space Institute bought Arden House and its surrounding . The\nhouse commands extensive views of the Ramapo River Valley.
