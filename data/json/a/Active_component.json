{"cursor":"10570","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Passivity' is a property of engineering systems, used in a variety of\nengineering disciplines, but most commonly found in analog electronics and\ncontrol systems. A 'passive component', depending on field, may be either a\ncomponent that consumes (but does not produce) energy (thermodynamic passivity),\nor a component that is incapable of power gain (incremental passivity).\n\nA component that is not passive is called an 'active component'. An electronic\ncircuit consisting entirely of passive components is called a passive circuit\n(and has the same properties as a passive component). Used without a qualifier,\nthe term 'passive' is ambiguous. Typically, analog designers use this term to\nrefer to 'incrementally passive' components and systems, while control systems\nengineers will use this to refer to 'thermodynamically passive' ones.\n\nSystems for which the small signal model is not passive are sometimes called\nlocally active (e.g. transistors and tunnel diodes). Systems that can generate\npower about a time-variant unperturbed state are often called parametrically\nactive (e.g. certain types of nonlinear capacitors).
