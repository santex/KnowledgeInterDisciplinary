It certifies and audits the circulations of major\npublications, including newspapers and magazines in India. âABCâ is a\nvoluntary organization initiated in 1948 and is presently operating in different\nparts of the world. Until that time, the concept of circulation audit was yet to\nbe made in India and the publishers had no means to verify the actual\ncirculation number of publications that they used for advertising and had to\ndepend more on their own judgment. Publishers also found it difficult to\nconvince advertisers of the relative values of their publication for the purpose\nof advertising. It is with this background that eminent representatives of the\nadvertising profession and publishing industry came together to establish an\norganization which could serve the common interest. Since then the benefit of\nABC certificates of circulation have been availed by advertisers, advertising\nagencies, publishers and organizations connected with print media advertising.\nSee List of newspapers in India by circulation.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Audit_Bureau_of_Circulations_(India)","recorded":1362581051,"links":11,"instances":["north_america"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Companies based in Mumbai","Non-profit organisations based in India","Companies established in 1948","Auditing","Indian publishing","Publishing organizations","Newspaper publishing in India","1948 establishments in India"],"headings":["History","Qualifications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/ABC_lndia_logo.jpg/200px-ABC_lndia_logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["audit_bureau_of_circulations","uk"],["audit_bureau_of_circulations","north_america"]],"members":["audit_bureau_of_circulations"],"related":["Private_company","Mumbai","Maharashtra","India","India","Non-profit","India","List_of_newspapers_in_India_by_circulation","India","Newspaper_circulation","Magazine_circulation","International_Federation_of_Audit_Bureaux_of_Circulations","Audit_Bureau_of_Circulations_(UK)","Audit_Bureau_of_Circulations_(North_America)","OJD_Morocco"]}
