Sister Irene is among the\n pioneers of modern adoption, establishing a system to board out children rather\n than institutionalize them.]]\n\n\n'Adoption' is a process whereby a person assumes the parenting for another and,\nin so doing, permanently transfers all rights and responsibilities, along with\nfiliation, from the biological parent or parents. Unlike guardianship or other\nsystems designed for the care of the young, adoption is intended to effect a\npermanent change in status and as such requires societal recognition, either\nthrough legal or religious sanction. Historically, some societies have enacted\nspecific laws governing adoption; where others have tried to achieve adoption\nthrough less formal means, notably via contracts that specified inheritance\nrights and parental responsibilities without an accompanying transfer of\nfiliation. Modern systems of adoption, arising in the 20th century, tend to be\ngoverned by comprehensive statutes and regulations.\n\nAdoption has changed considerably over the centuries with its focus shifting\nfrom adult adoption and inheritance issues toward children and family creation;\nits structure moving from a recognition of continuity between the adopted and\nkin toward allowing relationships of lessened intensity. In modern times,\nadoption is a primary vehicle serving the needs of homeless, neglected, abused\nand runaway children.<ref>The Psychology of Adoption&nbsp;— Page ix, David M.\nBrodzinsky Associate Professor of Developmental and Clinical Psychology Rutgers\nUniversity, Marshall D.
