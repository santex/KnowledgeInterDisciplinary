There is no cure for the disease,\nwhich worsens as it progresses, and eventually leads to death. It was first\ndescribed by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer in 1906\nand was named after him. Most often, AD is diagnosed in\npeople over 65 years of age, {{vcite journal |author=Brookmeyer R.,\nGray S., Kawas C. |title=Projections of Alzheimer's disease in the United States\nand the public health impact of delaying disease onset |journal=American Journal\nof Public Health |volume=88 |issue=9 |pages=1337â42 |year=1998 |month=September\n|pmid=9736873 |pmc=1509089 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.88.9.1337 }} although the less-\nprevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much earlier. In 2006, there were\nsufferers worldwide. Alzheimer's is predicted to affect 1 in 85 people globally\nby 2050.\n\nAlthough Alzheimer's disease develops differently for every individual, there\nare many common symptoms. {{cite web |title=What is\nAlzheimer's disease? |url=http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_i-\nnfo.php?documentID=100 |publisher=Alzheimers.org.uk |year=2007 |month=August |accessdate=2008-02-\n21 }} Early symptoms are often mistakenly thought to be 'age-related'\nconcerns, or manifestations of stress. {{vcite journal\n|author=Waldemar G |title=Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of\nAlzheimer's disease and other disorders associated with dementia: EFNS guideline\n|journal=Eur J Neurol |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=e1â26 |year=2007 |month=January\n|pmid=17222085 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01605.x |author-separator=,\n|author2=Dubois B |author3=Emre M |display-authors=3 |last4=Georges |first4=J.\n|last5=McKeith |first5=I.

When AD is suspected, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with tests that\nevaluate behaviour and thinking abilities, often followed by a brain scan if\navailable. {{cite web |title=Alzheimer's diagnosis of AD\n|url=http://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/diagnosis/ |publisher=Alzheimer's\nResearch Trust |accessdate=2008-02-29 }} As the disease advances, symptoms\ncan include confusion, irritability and aggression, mood swings, trouble with\nlanguage, and long-term memory loss. As the sufferer declines they often\nwithdraw from family and society. {{vcite journal |author=Tabert MH, Liu X, Doty RL, Serby M,\nZamora D, Pelton GH, Marder K, Albers MW, Stern Y, Devanand DP |title=A 10-item\nsmell identification scale related to risk for Alzheimer's disease |journal=Ann.\nNeurol. |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=155â160 |year=2005 |pmid=15984022\n|doi=10.1002/ana.20533 }} Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately\nleading to death. {{cite web |title=About Alzheimer's\nDisease: Symptoms |url=http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/topics/symptoms\n|publisher=National Institute on Aging |accessdate=2011-12-28 }} Since the\ndisease is different for each individual, predicting how it will affect the\nperson is difficult. AD develops for an unknown and variable amount of time\nbefore becoming fully apparent, and it can progress undiagnosed for years. On\naverage, the life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven\nyears. {{vcite journal |author=MÃ¶lsÃ¤ PK, Marttila RJ,\nRinne UK |title=Survival and cause of death in Alzheimer's disease and multi-\ninfarct dementia |journal=Acta Neurol Scand |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=103â7\n|year=1986 |month=August |pmid=3776457 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.1986.tb04634.x\n}} Fewer than three percent of individuals live more than fourteen years\nafter diagnosis. {{vcite journal |author=MÃ¶lsÃ¤ PK,\nMarttila RJ, Rinne UK |title=Long-term survival and predictors of mortality in\nAlzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia |journal=ActaNeurol Scand\n|volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=159â64 |year=1995 |month=March |pmid=7793228 }}\n\nThe cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood.\nResearch indicates that the disease is associated with plaques and tangles in\nthe brain. Current treatments only help with the\nsymptoms of the disease. There are no available treatments that stop or reverse\nthe progression of the disease. {{as of\n|2012}}, more than 1000 clinical trials have been or are being conducted to find\n|ways to treat the disease, but it is unknown if any of the tested treatments\n|will work. {{cite web\n|url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=alzheimer |title=Clinical\nTrials.
