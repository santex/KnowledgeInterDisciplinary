{"cursor":"12405","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'aldol condensation' is an organic reaction in which an enol or an enolate\nion reacts with a carbonyl compound to form a Î²-hydroxyaldehyde or Î²-\nhydroxyketone, followed by a dehydration to give a conjugated enone.\n\n\n\nAldol condensations are important in organic synthesis, providing a good way to\nform carbonâcarbon bonds. The Robinson annulation reaction sequence features an\naldol condensation; the Wieland-Miescher ketone product is an important starting\nmaterial for many organic syntheses. Aldol condensations are also commonly\ndiscussed in university level organic chemistry classes as a good bond-forming\nreaction that demonstrates important reaction mechanisms. In its usual\nform, it involves the nucleophilic addition of a ketone enolate to an aldehyde\nto form a Î²-hydroxy ketone, or \"'aldol'\" ('ald'ehyde + alcoh'ol'), a structural\nunit found in many naturally occurring molecules and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\nThe name 'aldol condensation' is also commonly used, especially in biochemistry,\nto refer to just the first (addition) stage of the processâthe aldol reaction\nitselfâas catalyzed by aldolases. However, the aldol reaction is not formally a\ncondensation reaction because it does not involve the loss of a small molecule.\n\nThe reactions between a ketone and a carbonyl compound lacking an alpha-\nHydrogen(Cross Aldol condensation) is called 'Claisen-Schmidt condensation'.\nThese reactions are named after two of its pioneering investigators Rainer\nLudwig Claisen and J. G. Schmidt, who independently published on this topic in\n1880 and 1881. An example is the synthesis of\ndibenzylideneacetone.\n","linknr":304,"url":"Aldol_condensation","recorded":1362481959,"links":29,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.mdpi.com/1422-8599/2004/1/M388/pdf","http://www.mdpi.com/1422-8599/2004/1/M388/pdf"],"categories":["Condensation reactions"],"headings":["Mechanism","Condensation types","Aldox process","Scope","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Condensationaldolique.png/600px-Condensationaldolique.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Simple_aldol_reaction.png/600px-Simple_aldol_reaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Enolate_aldol_mechanism.png/450px-Enolate_aldol_mechanism.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Enol_aldol_mechanism.png/450px-Enol_aldol_mechanism.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/AldoxProcess.png/400px-AldoxProcess.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/CrotonaldehydeAldol.png/400px-CrotonaldehydeAldol.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/M0388.png/600px-M0388.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/IsoprenetricarboxylicAcid2.png/500px-IsoprenetricarboxylicAcid2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/RuCatalyzedCyclizationofTerminalAlkynalstoCycloalkenes.png/500px-RuCatalyzedCyclizationofTerminalAlkynalstoCycloalkenes.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/ClaisenSchmidtReaction.png/400px-ClaisenSchmidtReaction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"],["saturation","chemistry"]],"members":["base","saturation"],"related":["Organic_reaction","Enol","Enolate_ion","Carbonyl","Dehydration_reaction","Enone","Organic_synthesis","Carbon–carbon_bond","Robinson_annulation","Wieland-Miescher_ketone","Organic_chemistry","Reaction_mechanism","Nucleophile","Ketone","Enolate","Aldehyde","Biochemistry","Aldol_reaction","Aldolase","Condensation_reaction","Rainer_Ludwig_Claisen","J._G._Schmidt","Dibenzylideneacetone","Aldol_reaction","Elimination_reaction","Decarboxylation","Base_(chemistry)","Potassium_tert-butoxide","Potassium_hydroxide","Sodium_hydride","Enolate","Enol","Addition_reaction","Active_hydrogen_compound","Knoevenagel_condensation","Perkin_reaction","Aromatic","Anhydride","Claisen_condensation","Ester","Dieckmann_condensation","Henry_reaction","Aldehyde","Aliphatic","Nitro_compound","Robinson_annulation","Saturation_(chemistry)","Ketone","Carbonyl","Michael_reaction","Guerbet_reaction","Japp-Maitland_condensation","Royal_Dutch_Shell","Exxon","Propylene","Syngas","2-Ethylhexanol","Hydroformylation","Butyraldehyde","Hydrogenation","Crotonaldehyde","Palladium","Amberlyst","Supercritical_carbon_dioxide","Sodium_hydride","Dioxane","Reflux","Hydrochloric_acid","Diethyl_ether","Hydrochloric_acid","Sodium_bicarbonate","Brine","Sodium_sulfate","Vacuum_distillation","Decarboxylation","Ethyl_glyoxylate","Glutaconate","Isoprene","Alkoxide","Carbon_dioxide","Steric_strain","Methyl","Carboxylic_acid","Diene","Catalytic_cycle","Cycloalkene","Ruthenium","Reaction_mechanism","Isotope_labeling","Ruthenium","Catalyst","Cyclopentadienyl","Ligand","Acetonitrile","Phosphorus_halides","Counterion","Acetic_acid","Deuterium","Isotopic_labeling","Chemical_yield","Transition_metal_carbene_complex","Nucleophilic_addition","Carbon_monoxide","Reductive_elimination","Menthone","Anisaldehyde","Steric_shielding","Potassium_hydroxide","Dimethyl_sulfoxide","Epimerization","Enolate","Cis_isomer","Organic_reaction","Chemical_reaction","Auwers_synthesis"]}
