{"cursor":"12032","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In immunology, an 'antigen' is a substance that evokes the production of one or\nmore antibodies. Each antibody binds to a specific antigen by way of an\ninteraction similar to the fit between a lock and a key. The substance may be\nfrom the external environment or formed within the body. The immune system will\ntry to destroy or neutralize any antigen that is recognized as a foreign and\npotentially harmful invader. The term originally came from 'anti'body\n'gen'erator Guyton and Hall (2006). Textbook of Medical\nPhysiology, 11th edition. Page 440. Elsevier, Inc. Philadelphia, PA. and\nwas a molecule that binds specifically to an antibody, but the term now also\nrefers to any molecule or molecular fragment that can be bound by a major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) and presented to a T-cell receptor. Parham,\nPeter. (2009). The Immune System, 3rd Edition, pg. G:2, Garland Science, Taylor\nand Francis Group, LLC. \"Self\" antigens are usually tolerated by the\nimmune system, whereas \"non-self\" antigens can be identified as invaders and can\nbe attacked by the immune system.\n\nAn 'immunogen' is a specific type of antigen. An immunogen is a substance that\nis able to provoke an adaptive immune response if injected on its\nown. Parham, Peter. (2009). The Immune System, 3rd Edition, pg. G:11,\nGarland Science, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. An immunogen is able to\ninduce an immune response, whereas an antigen is able to combine with the\nproducts of an immune response once they are made. Hapten is a small molecule,\nthat can not induce an immune response by itself. It needs to be attached to a\nlarge carrier molecule such as protein. The overlapping concepts of\n'immunogenicity' and 'antigenicity' are, therefore, subtly different. According\nto a current textbook:\n\nImmunogenicity is the ability to induce a humoral and/or cell-\nmediated immune response Antigenicity is the ability to\ncombine specifically with the final products of the immune response (i.e.\nsecreted antibodies and/or surface receptors on T-cells). Although all molecules\nthat have the property of immunogenicity also have the property of antigenicity,\nthe reverse is not true.\" \"Kuby Immunology\" 6th edition, Macmillan, 2006,\npg. 77 ISBN 1-4292-0211-4, ISBN 978-1-4292-0211-4\n\nAt the molecular level, an antigen can sometimes be characterized by its ability\nto be \"bound\" at the antigen-binding site of an antibody. Note also that\nantibodies tend to discriminate between the specific molecular structures\npresented on the surface of the antigen (as illustrated in the Figure). Antigens\nare usually proteins or polysaccharides. This includes parts (coats, capsules,\ncell walls, flagella, fimbrae, and toxins) of bacteria, viruses, and other\nmicroorganisms. Lipids and nucleic acids are antigenic only when combined with\nproteins and polysaccharides. Non-microbial exogenous (non-self) antigens can\ninclude pollen, egg white, and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or\non the surface of transfused blood cells. Vaccines are examples of immunogenic\nantigens intentionally administered to induce acquired immunity in the\nrecipient.\n\nCells present their immunogenic-antigens to the immune system via a\nhistocompatibility molecule. Depending on the antigen presented and the type of\nthe histocompatibility molecule, several types of immune cells can become\nactivated.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Antibody_generator","recorded":1362901832,"links":58,"instances":["immunology","medicine","immunology","physician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system","Biomolecules"],"headings":["Related concepts","Origin of the term antigen","Origin of antigens","Tumor antigens","Nativity","Antigenic specificity","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Antibody.svg/255px-Antibody.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["isotype","immunology"],["lászló_detre","physician"],["injection","medicine"],["priming","immunology"]],"members":["isotype","injection","priming","lászló_detre"],"related":["Immunology","Antibodies","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Hapten","Immune_response","Constant_region","Epitope","Protein","Polysaccharide","Bacteria","Virus","Microorganism","Lipid","Nucleic_acid","Vaccine","Adaptive_immune_system","Histocompatibility_molecule","Immune_cell","Complementarity_determining_region","Allergic_reaction","Molecular_form","Protein_A","Protein_G","Protein_L","Isotype_(immunology)","László_Detre_(physician)","Zymogen","Inhalation","Ingestion","Injection_(medicine)","Endocytosis","Phagocytosis","Antigen-presenting_cell","T_helper_cells","CD4","MHC_class_II","Cytokine","Cytotoxic_T_lymphocytes","B_cells","Macrophages","Metabolism","Infection","MHC_class_I","Cytotoxic_T_cell","Toxin","Lysis","Apoptosis","Central_tolerance","Xenogenic","Autologous","Idiotype","Immunoglobulin_allotype","Autoantigen","Autoimmune_disease","Immunological_tolerance","Immune_system","MHC_I","MHC_II","Tumor_cell","Tumor-specific_antigen","Tumor-associated_antigen","Cytotoxic_T_lymphocytes","Metastasize","B_cells","T_cells","B_cells","Antitoxin","Conformational_epitope","Epitope","Linear_epitope","Magnetic_immunoassay","Neutralizing_antibody","Original_antigenic_sin","Paul_Ehrlich","Polyclonal_B_cell_response","Priming_(immunology)"]}
