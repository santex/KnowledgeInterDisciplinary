When enough mutations have occurred and become stable in a\npopulation so that it is significantly differentiated from an ancestral\npopulation, a new species name may be assigned. A key point is that the entire\npopulation is different from the ancestral population such that the ancestral\npopulation can be considered extinct. A series of such species is collectively\nknown as an evolutionary 'lineage'. The University of California, Berkeley\nresource on understanding evolution defines a lineage as \"A continuous line of\ndescent; a series of organisms, populations, cells, or genes connected by\nancestor/descendent relationships.\"\n[http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/glossary/glossary.php?start=g&end=m\nUnderstanding Evolution, Glossary of Terms] The Oxford English\nDictionary defines biological lineage as \"a sequence of species each of which is\nconsidered to have evolved from its\npredecessor.\"[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/lineage?view=uk OED\ndefinition of lineage]\n\nIt is easy to see from the preceding definition how controversy can arise among\ntaxonomists when the differences are significant enough to warrant a new species\nclassification. Anagenesis may also be referred to as \"gradual evolution\".\n\nThe philosopher of science Marc Ereshefsky argues that paraphyletic taxa are the\nresult of anagenesis. The lineage leading to birds has diverged significantly\nfrom lizards and crocodiles, allowing evolutionary taxonomists to classify birds\nseparately from lizards and crocodiles, which are grouped as\nreptiles.\n\nRegarding social evolution, it has been suggested that social\nanagenesis/aromorphosis be viewed as universal or widely diffused social\ninnovation that raises social systems' complexity, adaptability, integrity, and\ninterconnectedness.
