William F. Albright has dated her reign to 842â837 BC, while Edwin R.\nThiele's dates, as taken from the third edition of his magnum opus, were\n842/841 to 836/835 BC. Edwin R. Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the\nHebrew Kings (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) 104.\nHowever, a starting date of 842/841 for Athaliah is one year before the date of\n841/840 that Thiele gave for death of her son Ahaziah, Ibid., 101. a\nconflict that Thiele never resolved. The present article accepts the one-year\nadjustment to Thiele's dates for Ahaziah given by later scholars that is\nexplained in the Rehoboam and Ahaziah articles, thereby reconciling Thiele's\ndates for Athaliah with those of her predecessor. These dates are also\ncompatible with cross-synchronisms between Ahaziah and Athaliah and the\nnorthern kingdom. Athaliah is usually considered the daughter of King Ahab and\nQueen Jezebel of Israel (see discussion below); her marriage to Jehoram sealed\na treaty between Israel and Judah.\n\nJehoram, a descendant of King David, actively promoted the worship of YHWH in\nhis country, but he tolerated Athaliah's worship of Baal. After Jehoram's death,\ntheir son Ahaziah became Judah's king with Athaliah acting as queen mother. She\nused her power in that role to establish the worship of Baal in Judah after\nAhaziah was killed in a state visit to Israel along with the then-king of\nIsrael, also named Jehoram, who was Athaliah's brother (or possibly nephew).\nJehu assassinated them both in Yahweh's name and had Athaliah's entire extended\nfamily in Israel put to death.\n\nAthaliah, as queen of Judah, tried to have all possible successors to Ahaziah\nexecuted; one, however,a grandson of hers named Joash was rescued from the purge\nby Jehosheba, Ahaziah's sister, and was raised in secret by the priest Jehoiada.\nSix years later, Athaliah was surprised when Jehoiada revealed Joash and\nproclaimed him king of Judah. She rushed to stop this rebellion, but was\ncaptured and executed.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Athaliah","recorded":1362565237,"links":47,"instances":["bible","samaria","given_name"],"pdf":[],"categories":["9th-century BC births","9th-century BC deaths","Murdered monarchs","Kings of ancient Judah","Queens regnant","9th-century BC biblical rulers","9th-century BC female rulers","Women in the Bible"],"headings":["Athaliah: daughter of Ahab, or his sister?","Further chronological notes","Athaliah in literature","Names in modern Israel","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Athalia.jpg/220px-Athalia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Athaliah1.jpg/220px-Athaliah1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kingdom_of_israel","samaria"],["jezebel","bible"],["kingdom_of_israel","samaria"],["odile","given_name"],["kingdom_of_israel","samaria"]],"members":["jezebel","kingdom_of_israel","odile"],"related":["Kingdom_of_Judah","Ahaziah_of_Judah","Jehoash_of_Judah","Ahab","Jezebel","Samaria","Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria)","Jerusalem","Kingdom_of_Judah","Queen_consort","Jehoram_of_Judah","Kingdom_of_Judah","Queen_regnant","William_F._Albright","Edwin_R._Thiele","Ahaziah_of_Judah","Rehoboam","Ahaziah_of_Judah","Ahab","Jezebel_(Bible)","Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria)","Treaty","David","YHWH","Baal","Ahaziah_of_Judah","Queen_mother","Jehoram_of_Israel","Jehu","Joash_of_Judah","Jehosheba","Jehoiada","Jehoram_of_Judah","Omri","Jezebel","Ithobaal_I","Tibni","Frank_Moore_Cross","Menander_of_Ephesus","Ithobaal_I","Phelles","Ahaziah_of_Judah","Jean_Racine","Felix_Mendelssohn","Incidental_music","List_of_compositions_by_Felix_Mendelssohn","Handel","Baal","Israel","Ottilie","Odile_(given_name)","Ophelia","Yiddish","Feminist","Hebrew_Bible","Books_of_Kings","Books_of_Chronicles","Josephus","Giovanni_Boccaccio","Handel","Samaria","Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria)","Jerusalem","Kingdom_of_Judah"]}
