{"cursor":"9433","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Adaptive expertise' is a broad construct that encompasses a range of cognitive,\nmotivational, and personality-related components, as well as habits of mind and\ndispositions. Generally, problem-solvers demonstrate adaptive expertise when\nthey are able to efficiently solve previously encountered tasks and generate new\nprocedures for new tasks. Hatano, G. and K. Inagaki (1986).\n\"Two courses of expertise.\" Child development and education in Japan:\n262â272. This definition can be contrasted with more traditional ideas of\nexpertise popularized by Chi Chi, M., Feltovich, P. and Glaser,\nR., (1981). Categorization and representation of physics problems by experts and\nnovices [http://www.pitt.edu/~chi/papers/ClassicCitation.pdf], Cognitive\nScience, 5, 121-152. and others, which do not typically consider\nadaptation to completely novel situations. Its empirical validity has been\nexamined in a number of training and learning contexts. The term was first\ncoined by Giyoo Hatano and Kayoko Inagaki, to tease out the\nvariability within groups of experts. To illustrate, imagine two sushi chefs:\none who makes every piece perfectly but routinely makes the same few types over\nand over (classic expertise), and one produces new menus frequently (adaptive\nexpertise). To some, this is an unfair comparison,as ones' environment supports\nbehavior. For example, the routine of the classic expert sushi chef may be tied\nto his restaurant environment, and this chef may be able to break out of the\nroutines easily given a different situation. However, the adaptive expert chef\nclearly demonstrates flexible knowledge and performance of sushi-making.\nLearning Scientists are interested in adaptive expertise, in part because they\nwould like to understand the types of learning trajectories that may allow\npractitioners break free from routines when necessary.\n\nThere is not, however, a true dichotomy between adaptive and classic expertise.\nExpertise can be thought of as a continuum of adaptive ability. On one end,\npractitioners can be classified as \"routinely skilled\" versus \"innovatively\ncompetent\"; as \"artisans\" versus \"virtuosos\"; Miller, R.B.\n(1978) \"The Information System Designer\" In Singleton, W.T. (Ed.) The Analysis\nof Practical Skills. Baltimore, MD: University Park Press. or as those\napproaching a task in a routine versus more flexible way. Schwartz, D. L., Bransford, J. D. & Sears, D. (2005). Efficiency\nand innovation in transfer. Transfer of Learning from a modern multidisciplinary\nperspective. [http://aaalab.stanford.edu/papers/Innovation%20in%20Transfer.pdf]\nJ. Mestre. Greenwich, CT, Information Age Publishing: 1-51. The notion of\nadaptive expertise suggests that new problems can be viewed as a platform for\nexploration in a new problem space and not just an\nopportunity to practice completing a task more efficiently. Bransford, J. D., Brown, A. L. & Cocking R. R. (2000) .\nWashington: National Academy Press For example, adaptability enabled the\nApollo 13 crew to successfully build an air filter from ill-fitting parts whilst\nin space, while the TV chef, Jamie Oliver, is able to flamboyantly and\ncreatively produce good food using only simple ingredients.\n\nA distinguishing feature of adaptive expertise is the ability to apply knowledge\neffectively to novel problems or atypical cases in a domain. Holyoak\ncharacterized adaptive experts as being capable of drawing on their knowledge to\ninvent new procedures for solving unique or fresh problems, rather than simply\napplying already mastered procedures. Holyoak, K. J. (1991) Symbolic\nConnectionism: Toward third-generation theories of expertise In K. A. Ericsson &\nJ. Smith (Eds.) Toward a General Theory of Expertise: Prospects and Limits 301-\n335. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Adaptability allows\nexperts to recognize when highly practiced rules and principles do not apply in\ncertain situations in which other solvers might typically attempt to use a\npreviously learned procedure. Gott, S., Hall, P., Pokorny, A.,\nDibble, E., & Glaser, R. (1992) A naturalistic study of transfer: Adaptive\nexpertise in technical domains In D. Detterman & R. Sternberg (Eds.) Transfer on\nTrial: Intelligence, Cognition, and Instruction 258â288. Norwood, NJ:\nAblex. Moreover, studies have shown that this flexibility can result in\nbetter performance than that of classically defined experts, resulting in,\namongst other things, better technical trouble shooting;\nworkplace error avoidance; and more accurate medical diagnosis. Feltovich,\nP. J., Spiro, R. J., & Coulson, R.L. (1997) Issues of expert flexibility in\ncontexts characterized by complexity and change In P. J. Feltovich, K. M. Ford,\n& R. R. Hoffman, (Eds.) Expertise In Context 126â146. Menlo Park, California:\nAAAI Press/MIT Press. John D. Bransford considers this flexible,\ninnovative application of knowledge, in large part, underlies adaptive experts'\ngreater tendency to enrich and refine their understanding on the basis of\ncontinuing experience to learn from problem-solving
