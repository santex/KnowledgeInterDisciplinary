{"cursor":"47889","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n in midtown Manhattan, New York, United States]] , Spain]] ]] , India]]\n\n area of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]] , on the north bank of the\n Thames, London, England]] An 'apartment' (in American English) or 'flat' in\n British English is a self-contained housing unit (a type of residential real\n estate) that occupies only part of a building. Such a building may be called an\n apartment building, apartment house (in American English), block of flats,\n [[tower block]], high-rise or, occasionally mansion block (in British English),\n especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. Apartments may be owned\n by an owner/occupier by leasehold tenure or rented by tenants (two types of\n housing tenure).\n\nThe term apartment is favored in North America (although flat is used in the\ncase of a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically\none to a floor), whereas the term flat is commonly, but not exclusively, used in\nthe United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong and most Commonwealth nations.\n\nIn Malaysian English, flat often denotes a housing block of lesser quality meant\nfor lower-income groups, while apartment is more generic and may also include\nluxury condominiums. This usage has also been appearing in British English where\napartment is used to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive\nresidential areas in, for example, parts of London such as Belgravia and\nHampstead.\n\nIn Australian English, the term flat was traditionally used, but the term\napartment is also frequently used, as is \"unit\", short for \"home unit\".\n\nTenement law refers to the feudal basis of permanent property such as land or\nrents. It may be found combined as in \"Messuage or Tenement\" to encompass all\nthe land, buildings and other assets of a property.\n\nIn the US, some apartment-dwellers own their own apartments, either as co-ops,\nin which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or\ndevelopment; or in condominiums, whose residents own their apartments and share\nownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for\nthe purpose, but large older houses are sometimes divided into apartments. The\nword apartment connotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some\nlocations, particularly the United States, the word denotes a rental unit owned\nby the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.\n\nIn the UK, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the freehold of\nthe building as well as holding the flat under a lease. This is commonly known\nas a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect\nannual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder\ncan also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and\nrestrictions that might apply.\n\nIn some countries the word 'unit' is a more general term referring to both\napartments and rental business suites. The word is generally used only in the\ncontext of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm\ngoing to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit\nsomewhere.\" In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even semi-\ndetached houses. Some buildings can be characterized as mixed use buildings,\nmeaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually\non the first floor or first couple of floors, and there are one or more\napartments in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.\n","linknr":792,"url":"Apartment","recorded":1362568284,"links":88,"instances":["watercraft","profession","address","term","building","lock","architect","law","building","housing","western_australia"],"pdf":["http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Housing-in-London-2012_v4.pdf","http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf"],"categories":["Apartments|","Real
