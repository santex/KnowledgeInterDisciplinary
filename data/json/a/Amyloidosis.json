The\ninsoluble fibrous protein aggregates that develop in amyloidosis are known as\namyloids. They result from a change in the protein's secondary structure, which\ncauses the protein to take on a particular aggregated insoluble form, similar to\nthe beta-pleated sheet. Symptoms vary\nwidely depending upon where in the body amyloid deposits accumulate. Amyloidosis\nmay be inherited or acquired. Senile systemic\namyloidosis was determined to be the primary cause of death for 70% of\nsupercentenarians who have been autopsied.\n","linknr":400,"url":"Amyloidosis","recorded":1362510739,"links":45,"instances":["waves","biology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Amyloidosis","Skin conditions resulting from errors in metabolism","Protein folding"],"headings":["Classification of amyloid","Pathogenesis","Classification","Symptoms","Diagnosis","Alternative classifications","Additional images","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Cardiac_amyloidosis_high_mag.jpg/230px-Cardiac_amyloidosis_high_mag.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Small_bowel_duodenum_with_amyloid_deposition_congo_red_10X.jpg/120px-Small_bowel_duodenum_with_amyloid_deposition_congo_red_10X.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Amyloidosis%2C_dystrophic_calcification%2C_H%26E.jpg/120px-Amyloidosis%2C_dystrophic_calcification%2C_H%26E.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Small_bowel_duodenum_with_amyloid_deposition_20X.jpg/120px-Small_bowel_duodenum_with_amyloid_deposition_20X.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Amyloidosis%2C_Node%2C_Congo_Red.jpg/120px-Amyloidosis%2C_Node%2C_Congo_Red.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Amyloidosis%2C_blood_vessels%2C_H%26E.jpg/120px-Amyloidosis%2C_blood_vessels%2C_H%26E.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Amyloidosis%2C_lymph_node%2C_H%26E.jpg/120px-Amyloidosis%2C_lymph_node%2C_H%26E.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Amyloidosis%2C_lymph_node%2C_polarizer.jpg/120px-Amyloidosis%2C_lymph_node%2C_polarizer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Cardiac_amyloidosis_very_high_mag_he.jpg/120px-Cardiac_amyloidosis_very_high_mag_he.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["tissue","biology"],["polarization","waves"]],"members":["polarization","tissue","organ"],"related":["Micrograph","Heart","Transthyretin-related_hereditary_amyloidosis","Congo_red_stain","Medicine","Protein","Insoluble","Extracellular_space","Organ_(anatomy)","Tissue_(biology)","Amyloid","Secondary_structure","Beta_sheet","Supercentenarian","Autopsy","Transthyretin","Systemic_disease","Genetic_disorder","Mutations","Immunoglobulin_light_chains","Multiple_myeloma","AL_amyloidosis","Acute_phase_protein","Chronic_inflammation","AA_amyloidosis","Proteolysis","Enzyme","Protease","Oligomer","Hydrophobic","Glycosaminoglycan","Serum_amyloid_P_component","Oligomers","OMIM","Amyloid_light_chain","AL_amyloidosis","Multiple_myeloma","Immunoglobulin_light-chains","Serum_amyloid_A","AA_amyloidosis","Β_amyloid","Amyloid_precursor_protein","Alzheimer_disease","Transthyretin","Familial_amyloid_polyneuropathies","Senile_systemic_amyloidosis","Leptomeningeal_amyloidosis","Beta-2_microglobulin","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Haemodialysis-associated_amyloidosis","Amylin","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Prion_protein","Prion","Creutzfeldt–Jakob_disease","Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy","Scrapie","Gelsolin","Finnish_type_amyloidosis","Cystatin_C","Cerebral_amyloid_angiopathy","APOA1","Familial_visceral_amyloidosis","Fibrinogen_alpha_chain","Familial_visceral_amyloidosis","LYZ","Familial_visceral_amyloidosis","OSMR","Primary_cutaneous_amyloidosis","ITM2B","Cerebral_amyloid_angiopathy","Prolactin","Prolactinoma","Keratoepithelin","Familial_corneal_amyloidosis","Atrial_natriuretic_factor","Senile_amyloid_of_atria_of_heart","Calcitonin","Medullary_carcinoma_of_the_thyroid","Inclusion_bodies","Heart_failure","Cardiac_dysrhythmia","Hemoptysis","Spleen","Gastrointestinal_tract","Polyneuropathy","Lesions","Petechiae","Macroglossia","Rectum","Salivary_gland","Biopsy","Congo_red","Polarization_(waves)","Microscopy","Thioflavin","Protein_electrophoresis","Amino_acid","Aβ","Amylin","Atrial_natriuretic_factor","Isolated_atrial_amyloidosis","Calcitonin","Medullary_carcinoma_of_the_thyroid","Primary_amyloidosis_","Multiple_myeloma","Reactive_systemic_amyloidosis","Secondary_cutaneous_amyloidosis","Dystrophic_calcification","Cardiac_amyloidosis","H&E_stain","Proteopathy"]}
