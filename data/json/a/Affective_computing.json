{"cursor":"36500","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:Affective Computing is also the title of a textbook on the subject by\n[[Rosalind Picard]].\n\n'Affective computing' is the study and development of systems and devices that\ncan recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. It is an\ninterdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences, psychology, and cognitive\nscience. While the origins of the field may be traced as\nfar back as to early philosophical enquiries into emotion, Cited by Tao and\nTan. the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind\nPicard's 1995 paper [http://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/95.picard.pdf\n\"Affective Computing\"] MIT Technical Report #321 ([http://vismod.media.mit.edu/pub/tech-reports/TR-321-\nABSTRACT.html Abstract]), 1995 on affective computing. {{cite web\n|url= http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de//~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-\ninteraction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf |title= Recognition and\nSimulation of Emotions |accessdate= May 13, 2008 |last= Kleine-Cosack |first=\nChristian |year= 2006 |month= October |format= PDF |quote= The introduction of\nemotion to computer science was done by Pickard (sic) who created the field of\naffective computing. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080528135730/http://ls12-www.cs.tu-\ndortmund.de/~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-\nRecognitionAndSimulation.pdf  |archivedate = May\n28, 2008}}  {{cite web |url=\nhttp://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/love.html |title= The Love Machine;\nBuilding computers that care |accessdate= May 13, 2008 |last= Diamond |first=\nDavid |year= 2003 |month= December |publisher= Wired |quote= Rosalind Picard, a\ngenial MIT professor, is the field's godmother; her 1997 book, Affective\nComputing, triggered an explosion of interest in the emotional side of computers\nand their users.\n| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080518185630/http://www.wired.com/w-\n| ired/archive/11.12/love.html| archivedate= 18 May 2008 |\n| deadurl= no}}\n A motivation for the research is the ability to simulate empathy.
