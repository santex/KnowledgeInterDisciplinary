{"cursor":"31774","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Atomic force microscopy' (AFM) or scanning force microscopy (SFM) is a very high-\nresolution type of scanning probe microscopy, with demonstrated resolution on\nthe order of fractions of a nanometer, more than 1000 times better than the\noptical diffraction limit. The precursor to the AFM, the scanning tunneling\nmicroscope, was developed by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in the early 1980s\nat IBM Research - Zurich, a development that earned them the Nobel Prize for\nPhysics in 1986. Binnig, Quate and Gerber invented the first atomic force\nmicroscope (also abbreviated as AFM) in 1986. The first commercially available\natomic force microscope was introduced in 1989. The AFM is one of the foremost\ntools for imaging, measuring, and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. The\ninformation is gathered by \"feeling\" the surface with a mechanical probe.\nPiezoelectric elements that facilitate tiny but accurate and precise movements\non (electronic) command enable the very precise scanning. In some variations,\nelectric potentials can also be scanned using conducting cantilevers. In more\nadvanced versions, currents can be passed through the tip to probe the\nelectrical conductivity or transport of the underlying surface, but this is much\nmore challenging with few research groups reporting consistent data (as of\n2004).\n","linknr":484,"url":"Atomic_force_microscopy","recorded":1362509616,"links":62,"instances":["deformation","waves","applications"],"pdf":["http://www.see.ed.ac.uk/~vkoutsos/Force-distance%20curves%20by%20atomic%20force%20microscopy.pdf"],"categories":["Scanning
