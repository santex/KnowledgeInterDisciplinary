{"cursor":"23044","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Attention deficit disorder' ('ADD') is one of the three subtypes of attention-\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The term was formally changed in 1994 in\nthe new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition\n(DSM-IV) to \"ADHD predominantly inattentive\" (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), though the\nterm attention deficit disorder is still widely used. ADD is similar to the\nother subtypes of ADHD in that it is characterized primarily by inattention,\neasy distractibility, disorganization, procrastination, and forgetfulness; where\nit differs is in lethargy - fatigue, and having fewer or no symptoms of\nhyperactivity or impulsiveness typical of the other ADHD subtypes. Different\ncountries have used different ways of diagnosing ADD. In the United Kingdom,\ndiagnosis is based on quite a narrow set of symptoms, and about 0.5â1% of\nchildren are thought to have attention or hyperactivity problems. The United\nStates used a much broader definition of the term ADHD. As a result, up to 10%\nof children in the U.S. were described as having ADHD. Current estimates suggest\nthat ADHD is present throughout the world in about 1â5% of the population. About\nfive times more boys than girls are diagnosed with ADHD. Medications include two\nclasses of drugs, stimulants and non-stimulants. Drugs for ADHD are divided into\nfirst-line medications and second-line medications. First-line medications\ninclude several of the stimulants, and tend to have a higher response rate and\neffect size than second-line medications. Although medication can help improve\nconcentration, it does not cure ADHD and the symptoms will come back once the\nmedication stops.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Attention_deficit_disorder","recorded":1362688657,"links":22,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":["http://www.help4adhd.org/documents/WWK8.pdf"],"categories":["Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder"],"headings":["Differences from other ADHD subtypes","Symptoms","Prevalence in children","Treatment","Research","Strategies for parents of afflicted children","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fatigue","medical"],["fatigue","medical"]],"members":["fatigue"],"related":["Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","Fatigue_(medical)","Hyperactivity","Stimulants","Fatigue_(medical)","Hyperactivity","Negative_feedback","Self-image","Self-reinforcing","Postsecondary","Self-esteem","Anxiety_disorders","Sexual_promiscuity","Mood_disorders","Substance_abuse","Cognitive","Coping_skill","Daydreaming","Sluggish_cognitive_tempo","Russell_Barkley","Sluggish_cognitive_tempo","Conduct_disorder","Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","Pervasive_developmental_disorder","Schizophrenia","Psychotic_disorder","Mood_disorder","Anxiety_disorder","Dissociative_disorder","Personality_disorder","Procrastination","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Stimulants","Methylphenidate","Adderall","Vyvanse","Zoloft","Prozac","Wellbutrin","Mount_Sinai_Hospital,_New_York","National_Institutes_of_Health","Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging","Calendars","Confidence","Dopamine","Norepinephrine","Serotonin","Adult_attention-deficit_disorder","Auditory_processing_disorder","Chemical_imbalance_theory","Educational_psychology","Pediatric_Attention_Disorders_Diagnostic_Screener","School_psychology","Sensory_integration_disorder","Sluggish_cognitive_tempo","Psychiatric_diagnosis"]}
