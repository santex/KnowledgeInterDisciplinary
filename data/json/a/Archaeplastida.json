The\nplastids (chloroplasts) of all of these organisms are surrounded by two\nmembranes, suggesting they developed directly from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria.\nIn all other groups, plastids are surrounded by three or four membranes,\nsuggesting they were acquired secondarily from red or green algae.\n\nAlthough many studies have suggested that the Archaeplastida form a monophyletic\ngroup, a 2009 paper argues that they are in fact\nparaphyletic. The enrichment of novel red algal genes\nin a recent study demonstrates a strong signal for Plantae (Archaeplastida)\nmonophyly and an equally strong signal of gene sharing history between the\nred/green algae and other lineages. This study\nprovides insight on how rich mesophilic red algal gene data is crucial for\ntesting controversial issues in eukaryote evolution and for understanding the\ncomplex patterns of gene inheritance in protists.\n\nThe cells of the Archaeplastida typically lack centrioles and have mitochondria\nwith flat cristae. There is usually a cell wall including cellulose, and food is\nstored in the form of starch. However, these characters are also shared with\nother eukaryotes. The main evidence the Archaeplastida form a monophyletic group\ncomes from genetic studies, which indicate that their plastids probably had a\nsingle origin. This evidence is disputed.\nPhotosynthetic organisms with plastids of different origin (like brown algae,\nfor instance) do not belong to Archaeplastida.\n\nThe archaeplastidans fall into two main evolutionary lines. The red algae are\npigmented with chlorophyll ''a'' and phycobiliproteins, like most cyanobacteria.\nThe green algae and land plants â together known as Viridiplantae (Latin for\n\"green plants\") or Chloroplastida â are pigmented with chlorophylls a and\n[[Chlorophyll b|b]], but lack phycobiliproteins. The glaucophytes have typical\ncyanobacterial pigments, and are unusual in retaining a cell wall within their\nplastids (called cyanelles).\n","linknr":528,"url":"Archaeplastida","recorded":1362477087,"links":33,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Eukaryotes"],"headings":["Taxonomy","Morphology","Endosymbiosis","Fossil record","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Paintbrushandhuckleberry.JPG/280px-Paintbrushandhuckleberry.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Eukaryota","Red_algae","Glaucophyte","Plantae","Land_plant","Green_algae","Eukaryote","Red_alga","Green_alga","Embryophyte","Glaucophyte","Plastid","Chloroplast","Cyanobacteria","Monophyly","Paraphyly","Centriole","Mitochondrion","Crista","Cell_wall","Cellulose","Starch","Monophyly","Brown_algae","Chlorophyll_a","Phycobiliprotein","Viridiplantae","Clade","Monophyletic","Paraphyletic","Clade","Viridiplantae","Embryophyte","Eukaryote","Glaucophyta","Peptidoglycan","Rhodophyta","Phycobiliprotein","Accessory_pigment","Viridiplantae","Chlorophyta","Ulvophyceae","Trebouxiophyceae","Chlorophyceae","Chlorodendrales","Prasinophyte","Charophyta","Chlorokybales","Klebsormidiales","Zygnematales","Coleochaetales","Streptophytina","Charales","Plantae","Glaucophyta","Rhodophyceae","Viridiplantae","Chlorophyta","Ulvophyceae","Trebouxiophyceae","Chlorophyceae","Chlorodendrales","Prasinophyte","Mesostigma","Charophyta","Streptophytina","Charales","Plantae","Endosymbiotic_theory","Ulvophyceae","Stonewort","Euglenid","Chlorarachniophyte","Heterokont","Cryptophyte","Haptophyte","Dinoflagellate","Microfossil","Mesoproterozoic","Molecular_clock","Neoproterozoic","Paleozoic"]}
