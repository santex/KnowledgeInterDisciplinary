{"cursor":"17593","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'anesthetic' (American English) (or 'anaesthetic', (Commonwealth English) see\nspelling differences) is a drug that causes anesthesiaâ€”reversible loss of\nsensation. They contrast with analgesics (painkillers), which relieve pain\nwithout eliminating sensation. These drugs are generally administered to\nfacilitate surgery. A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic\npractice. Many are rarely used outside of anesthesia, although others are used\ncommonly by all disciplines. Anesthetics are categorized into two classes:\ngeneral anesthetics, which cause a reversible loss of consciousness, and local\nanesthetics, which cause a reversible loss of sensation for a limited region of\nthe body while maintaining consciousness. Combinations of anesthetics are\nsometimes used for their synergistic and additive therapeutic effects. Adverse\neffects, however, may also be increased.\n","linknr":634,"url":"Anesthetic","recorded":1362560346,"links":35,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anesthetics|"],"headings":["Local anesthetics","General anesthetics","Intravenous opioid analgesic agents","Muscle relaxants","Intravenous reversal agents","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Anesthesia","Analgesic","Surgery","General_anesthetic","Local_anesthetic","Procaine","Amethocaine","Cocaine","Lidocaine","Prilocaine","Bupivacaine","Levobupivacaine","Ropivacaine","Mepivacaine","Dibucaine","Sodium_channels","Ester","Amide","Racemic","Preservative","Intrathecal","Desflurane","Enflurane","Halothane","Isoflurane","Methoxyflurane","Nitrous_oxide","Sevoflurane","Xenon","Volatile_anaesthetic","Isoflurane","Desflurane","Sevoflurane","Adjuvant","Minimum_alveolar_concentration","Minimum_alveolar_concentration","Blood/gas_partition_coefficient","Barbiturate","Amobarbital","Trade_name","Methohexital","Thiamylal","Sodium_thiopental","Benzodiazepines","Diazepam","Lorazepam","Midazolam","Etomidate","Ketamine","Propofol","Analgesia","Sedation","Intensive_care_unit","Dream","Illusion","Catalepsy","Sleep","Ketamine","Isoflurane","Neurodegeneration","Alfentanil","Fentanyl","Remifentanil","Sufentanil","Buprenorphine","Butorphanol","Diamorphine","Heroin","Hydromorphone","Levorphanol","Meperidine","Methadone","Morphine","Nalbuphine","Oxycodone","Oxymorphone","Pentazocine","Intubation","Succinylcholine","Decamethonium","Mivacurium","Rapacuronium","Atracurium","Cisatracurium","Rocuronium","Vecuronium","Alcuronium","Doxacurium","Gallamine","Metocurine","Pancuronium","Pipecuronium","Tubocurarine","Acetylcholine_receptors","Malignant_hyperthermia","Anesthesia_awareness","Flumazenil","Naloxone","Neostigmine","Sugammadex"]}
