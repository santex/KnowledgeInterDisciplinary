{"cursor":"51764","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Activated carbon', also called 'activated charcoal', 'activated coal', or\n'carbo activatus', is a form of carbon processed to be riddled with small, low-\nvolume pores that increase the surface area available for adsorption or chemical reactions. [http://www.activated-carbon.com/1-\n3.html \"Properties of Activated Carbon\", CPL Caron Link, accessed 2008-05-\n02] Activated is sometimes substituted with active.\n\nDue to its high degree of microporosity, just one gram of activated carbon has a\nsurface area in excess of 500 m 2, as determined by adsorption\nisotherms of carbon dioxide gas at room or 0.0 Â°C temperature. An\nactivation level sufficient for useful application may be attained solely from\nhigh surface area; however, further chemical treatment often enhances adsorption\nproperties.\n\nActivated carbon is usually derived from charcoal.\n","linknr":728,"url":"Activated_carbon","recorded":1362375326,"links":54,"instances":["pharmacy","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","element","physics","scale","chemistry","resin","unit","pharmacy"],"pdf":["http://cgpl.iisc.ernet.in/site/Portals/0/Publications/Presentations/Bio-Energy/Value%20Added%20Products%20From%20Gasification%20%20-%20Activated%20Carbon.pdf","http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~scsharip/Activated_carbon_JPCM.pdf"],"categories":["Carbon
