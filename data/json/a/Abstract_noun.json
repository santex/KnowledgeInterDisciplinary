Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.\n[http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsANoun.htm\nGlossary of linguistic terms: What is a noun?]\n\nLexical categories are defined in terms of the ways in which their members\ncombine with other kinds of expressions. The syntactic rules for nouns differ\nfrom language to language. In English, nouns are those words which can occur\nwith articles and attributive adjectives and can function as the head of a\nnoun phrase.\n","linknr":482,"url":"Abstract_noun","recorded":1362485181,"links":112,"instances":["linguistics","grammar","linguistics","grammar","linguistics","grammar","linguist","grammar","linguistics","linguistics","grammatical_number","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://post.queensu.ca/%7Elaycockh/Mass%20nouns%20%20Count%20nouns%20%20Non-count%20nouns.pdf"],"categories":["Grammar","Nomenclature","Parts of speech"],"headings":["History","Definitions of nouns","Forms of nouns","Gender","Classification of nouns","Noun phrases","Pronouns","''Substantive'' as a word for ''noun''","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["article","grammar"],["open_class","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["object","grammar"],["head","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["stem","linguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"],["conversion","linguistics"],["dual","grammatical_number"],["subject","grammar"],["agreement","linguistics"],["head","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"],["mark_baker","linguist"]],"members":["head","object","stem","subject","morphology","predicate","mark_baker","article","agreement","open_class","dual","conversion"],"related":["Article_(grammar)","Adjective","Part_of_speech","Linguistics","Open_class_(linguistics)","Lexical_category","Subject_(grammar)","Clause","Object_(grammar)","Verb","Preposition","Syntactic","English_language","Adjective","Head_(linguistics)","Noun_phrase","Latin","Cognate","Ancient_Greek","Sanskrit","Morphology_(linguistics)","Grammatical_gender","Grammatical_case","Grammatical_number","Dionysius_Thrax","Semantics","Linguistics","Morphology_(linguistics)","Prefix","Suffix","Syntax","Russian_language","Stem_(linguistics)","Word_formation","Morphology_(linguistics)","Prefix","Suffix","Verbal_noun","Agent_noun","Feminine_form","Adjective","Conversion_(linguistics)","German_language","Lexeme","Inflection","Grammatical_number","Grammatical_case","Plural","English_plural","Dual_(grammatical_number)","Syntax","Latin","Russian_language","Finnish_language","Nominative","Subject_(grammar)","Accusative","Direct_object","Genitive","Modern_English","Saxon_genitive","Possessive_determiner","Agreement_(linguistics)","French_language","Italian_language","Russian_language","Sex","Czech_language","Plural","Numeral_system","Quantifiers","Manfred_Krifka","Grammatical_number","Head_(linguistics)","Subject_(grammar)","Physical_bodies","Sense","Abstract_object","Pronoun","Latin_language","Metalanguage","Description","Grammatical_case","Phi_features","Reference","Peter_Thomas_Geach","Verbs","Adjectives","Predicate_(grammar)","Mark_Baker_(linguist)","Parts_of_speech"]}
