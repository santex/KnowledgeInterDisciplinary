Ascot caps are typically made from felt or wool and worn in the fall or\nwinter, but straw Ascots also exist for warmer weather.\n\nAn Ascot being of a single color mostly matches up with casual clothes of that\ncolor or those who match it with a suit match up the color with the suit setup.\nUnlike the flat cap, the inside is not lined with silk but the closed in design\nand softness of felt still provides comfort and warmth. The style dates back to\n1900 and is popular as an Original.\n\nIt is usually worn by men, but some women wear the style. The Ascot style\nusually is felt. However, leather, cord, tweed and even Irish Patchwork styles\nare also available.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Ascot_cap","recorded":1362566450,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Caps"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/DarkGreenAscotCapOnHead.jpg/220px-DarkGreenAscotCapOnHead.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Signorina_in_viola.svg/18px-Signorina_in_viola.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cap","Flat_cap","Felt","Winter","Straw"]}
