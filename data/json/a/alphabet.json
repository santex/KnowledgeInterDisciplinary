This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as\nsyllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in\nwhich each character represents a word, morpheme or semantic unit).\n\nA 'true alphabet' has letters for the vowels of a language as well as the\nconsonants. The first \"true alphabet\" in this sense is believed to be the Greek\nalphabet,<ref name=\"Blackwell\"></ref><ref></ref> which is a modified form of the\nPhoenician alphabet. In other types of alphabet either the vowels are not\nindicated at all, as was the case in the Phoenician alphabet (such systems are\nknown as abjads), or else the vowels are shown by diacritics or modification of\nconsonants, as in the devanagari used in India and Nepal (these systems are\nknown as abugidas or alphasyllabaries).\n\nThere are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the Latin\nalphabet<ref></ref> (which was derived from the Greek). Many languages use\nmodified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using\ndiacritical marks. While most alphabets have letters composed of lines (linear\nwriting), there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in Braille,\nfingerspelling, and Morse code.\n\nAlphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of their letters.\nThis makes them useful for purposes of collation, specifically by allowing\nwords to be sorted in alphabetical order. It also means that their letters can\nbe used as an alternative method of \"numbering\" ordered items, in such contexts\nas numbered lists.\n","title":"alphabet","headings":["Etymology","History","Types","Alphabetical order","Names of letters","Orthography and pronunciation","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"]},"micro-relation":["8: Hebrew_alphabet","7: Greek_alphabet","6: Latin_alphabet","6: Arabic_alphabet","5: Hangul","4: Phoenician_alphabet","4: Abjad","4: Ge'ez_alphabet","4: Cyrillic","3: Phoneme","3: Consonant","3: Diacritic","3: Devanagari","3: Abugida","3: Collation","3: Logogram","3: Syriac_alphabet","3: Icelandic_language","3: Runic_alphabet","3: Latin_script","3: Arabic_script","2: Language","2: Alphabetical_order","2: Cuneiform","2: Aramaic","2: Ugaritic_script","2: Linear_B","2: Glagolitic_alphabet","2: Old_English_language","2: Italian_language","2: Old_Italic_alphabet","2: Aramaic_alphabet","2: Zhuyin","2: Taiwan","2: Armenian_alphabet","2: Indic_scripts","2: Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics","2: Kabardian_language","2: French_language","2: Turkish_alphabet","2: Spanish_language","2: Finnish_language","1: Symbols","1: Graphemes","1: Spoken_language","1: Writing_system","1: Syllabary","1: Syllable","1: Logograph","1: Morpheme","1: Vowel","1: Linear_writing","1: Non-linear_writing","1: Braille","1: Fingerspelling","1: Morse_code","1: Numbered_list","1: Middle_English","1: Late_Latin","1: Greek_language","1: Font","1: William_Caslon","1: Ancient_Egypt","1: Egyptian_uniliteral_signs","1: Middle_Bronze_Age","1: Proto-Sinaitic_script","1: Sinai_peninsula","1: Ugarit","1: Ahiram","1: Canaanite_language","1: South_Arabian_alphabet","1: Mater_lectionis","1: Egyptian_hieroglyphs","1: Mycenaean_Greece","1: Bulgaria","1: Euboean_alphabet","1: Italic_languages","1: Romance_languages","1: Æ","1: Algonquian_languages","1: Elder_Futhark","1: Old_Hungarian_script","1: Old_Church_Slavonic","1: Cyrillic_script","1: Soviet_Union","1: Cyrillic_alphabets","1: Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet","1: Macedonian_alphabet","1: Bulgarian_alphabet","1: Russian_alphabet","1: Saints_Cyril_and_Methodius","1: Clement_of_Ohrid","1: Written_Chinese","1: Brahmi_script","1: Korea","1: Sejong_the_Great","1: Hunminjeongeum","1: Featural_alphabet","1: Chinese_characters","1: Semi-syllabary","1: Mandarin_Chinese","1: China","1: Pinyin","1: Syllable_onset","1: Syllable_rime","1: Syllable#Medial_and_final","1: Romanization","1: Urdu_alphabet","1: Persian_alphabet","1: Kurdish_alphabet","1: Uyghur_alphabet","1: Ge'ez_script","1: Linguistics","1: Paleographer","1: Middle_Bronze_Age_alphabets","1: Hebrew_script","1: Tigrinya_language","1: Amharic_language","1: Hindi","1: Thai_language","1: Coptic_alphabet","1: Zero_consonant","1: Sorani","1: Kurdish_language","1: Phagspa_script","1: Mongol_Empire","1: Tibetan_script","1: Ethiopia","1: Categorisation","1: Somali_language","1: Vietnamese_alphabet","1: Thai_alphabet","1: Pollard_script","1: Hmong_alphabet","1: Zhuang_alphabet","1: Virama","1: Pahlavi_scripts","1: Rotokas_alphabet","1: Hawaiian_language","1: ʻokina","1: Papyrus","1: Demotic_Egyptian","1: Sanskrit","1: Sindhi_language","1: Abkhaz_language","1: Slovak_language","1: Georgian_alphabet","1: Multigraph","1: Real_Academia_Española","1: Association_of_Spanish_Language_Academies","1: Lexicography","1: Albanian_alphabet","1: German_alphabet","1: Grapheme","1: Danish_and_Norwegian_alphabet","1: Hanuno'o_script","1: Ugaritic_alphabet","1: Gothic_alphabet","1: Abjadi_order","1: Brahmic_family","1: Phonology","1: Kana","1: Samaritan_alphabet","1: Orthography","1: Spelling","1: Phonemic_orthography","1: German_language","1: Modern_Greek","1: Sandhi","1: Hiragana","1: Katakana","1: Germanic_languages","1: English_language","1: Turkish_language","1: Serbo-Croatian_language","1: Serbian_language","1: Croatian_language","1: Bosnian_language","1: Bulgarian_language","1: Silent_letter","1: Nasal_vowel","1: Elision","1: Great_Vowel_Shift","1: Spelling_reform","1: Turkey","1: International_Phonetic_Alphabet","1: Abecedarium","1: Acrophony","1: Akshara","1: Alphabet_book","1: Alphabet_Effect","1: Alphabet_song","1: Alphabetize","1: Butterfly_Alphabet","1: Character_encoding","1: Constructed_script","1: English_alphabet","1: ICAO_spelling_alphabet","1: Lipogram","1: List_of_alphabets","1: Pangram","1: Thai_script#Alphabet_listing","1: Transliteration","1: Unicode","1: Michael_Everson","1: University_of_Maryland"]}
