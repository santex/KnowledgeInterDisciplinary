Simply put, availability is the\n  proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. This is often\n  described as a 'mission capable rate'. Mathematically, this is expressed as 1\n  minus unavailability.\n* The ratio of (a) the total time a functional unit is capable of being used\n  during a given interval to (b) the length of the interval.\n\nFor example, a unit that is capable of being used 100 hours per week (168 hours)\nwould have an availability of 100/168. However, typical availability values are\nspecified in decimal (such as 0.9998). In high availability applications, a\nmetric known as nines, corresponding to the number of nines following the\ndecimal point, is used. In this system, \"five nines\" equals 0.99999 (or 99.999%)\navailability.\n","title":"availability","headings":["Introduction","Representation","Literature","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Mean_time_to_failure","2: Mean_time_to_repair","1: Reliability_theory","1: Reliability_engineering","1: System","1: Subsystem","1: Unavailability","1: Functional_unit","1: Decimal","1: High_availability","1: Systems_Engineering","1: Stochastic_modeling","1: Optimal_maintenance","1: Downtime","1: Spare_part","1: Reliability_Engineering","1: Safety_Engineering","1: List_of_system_quality_attributes","1: Spurious_trip_level","1: Condition-based_maintenance","1: Fault_reporting"]}
