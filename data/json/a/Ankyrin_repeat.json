Domains consisting of ankyrin repeats\nmediate protein-protein interactions and are among the most common structural\nmotifs in known proteins. They appear in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic\nproteins, but are far more common in eukaryotes. Ankyrin repeat proteins, though\nabsent in most viruses, are common among poxviruses. Most proteins that contain\nthe motif have four to six repeats, although its namesake ankyrin contains 24,\nand the largest known number of repeats is 34, predicted in a protein expressed\nby [[Giardia lamblia]].\n\nAnkyrin repeats typically fold together to form a single, linear solenoid\nstructure called 'ankyrin repeat domains'. These domains are one of the most\ncommon proteinâprotein interaction platforms in nature. They occur in a large\nnumber of functionally diverse proteins, mainly from eukaryotes. The few known\nexamples from prokaryotes and viruses may be the result of horizontal gene\ntransfers. The repeat has been found in proteins\nof diverse function such as transcriptional initiators, cell cycle regulators,\ncytoskeletal, ion transporters, and signal transducers. The ankyrin fold appears\nto be defined by its structure rather than its function, since there is no\nspecific sequence or structure that is universally recognised by it.\n","linknr":473,"url":"Ankyrin_repeat","recorded":1362486622,"links":12,"instances":["gene","genetics","gene","gene","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein structural motifs"],"headings":["Role in protein folding","Clinical significance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Ankyrin_R_membrane-binding_domain_1N11.png/220px-Ankyrin_R_membrane-binding_domain_1N11.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["loop","biochemistry"],["conservation","genetics"],["p16","gene"],["p16","gene"],["gls","gene"],["mib1","gene"]],"members":["mib1","conservation","gls","p16","loop"],"related":["ANK1","Protein_motif","Protein","Alpha_helix","Loop_(biochemistry)","Cell_signaling","Yeast","Cdc10","Notch_pathway","Protein-protein_interaction","Bacteria","Archaea","Eukaryote","Poxviruses","Ankyrin","Protein_folding","Solenoid_protein_domain","Eukaryote","Prokaryote","Cell_cycle","Cytoskeleton","Ion_transporter","Signal_transduction","Multiple_sequence_alignment","Conservation_(genetics)","Amino_acid","Hydrophobic","Protein_design","Consensus_sequence","Protein_folding","Antibody","Protein_folding","Globular_protein","Tertiary_structure","Native_contact","Contact_order","Two-state_folding","Phi_value_analysis","C-terminus","Disease","Cell_cycle","P16_(gene)","Cancer","CADASIL","Muscle","Glutamine","Lysine","ANKK1","Love_style","ABTB1","ABTB2","ACBD6","ACTBL1","ANK1","ANK2","ANK3","ANKAR","ANKDD1A","ANKFY1","ANKHD1","ANKIB1","ANKK1","ANKMY1","ANKMY2","ANKRA2","ANKRD1","ANKRD10","ANKRD11","ANKRD12","ANKRD13","ANKRD13A","ANKRD13B","ANKRD13C","ANKRD13D","ANKRD15","ANKRD16","ANKRD17","ANKRD18A","ANKRD18B","ANKRD19","ANKRD2","ANKRD20A1","ANKRD20A2","ANKRD20A3","ANKRD20A4","ANKRD21","ANKRD22","ANKRD23","ANKRD25","ANKRD26","ANKRD27","ANKRD28","ANKRD30A","ANKRD30B","ANKRD32","ANKRD33","ANKRD35","ANKRD36","ANKRD36B","ANKRD37","ANKRD38","ANKRD39","ANKRD40","ANKRD41","ANKRD42","ANKRD43","ANKRD44","ANKRD45","ANKRD46","ANKRD47","ANKRD49","ANKRD5","ANKRD50","ANKRD52","ANKRD53","ANKRD54","ANKRD55","ANKRD56","ANKRD57","ANKRD58","ANKRD6","ANKRD7","ANKRD9","ANKS1A","ANKS3","ANKS4B","ANKS6","ANKZF1","ASB1","ASB10","ASB11","ASB12","ASB13","ASB14","ASB15","ASB16","ASB2","ASB3","ASB4","ASB5","ASB6","ASB7","ASB8","ASB9","ASZ1","BARD1","BAT4","BAT8","BCL3","BCOR","BCORL1","BTBD11","C20orf12","C20orf86","C21orf99","C7orf7","CAMTA1","CAMTA2","CASKIN1","CASKIN2","CCM1","P16_(gene)","CDKN2B","CDKN2C","CDKN2D","CENTB1","CENTB2","CENTB5","CENTG1","CENTG2","CENTG3","CLIP3","CLIP4","CLPB","CTGLF1","CTGLF2","CTGLF3","CTGLF4","CTGLF5","CTTNBP2","DAPK1","DDEF1","DDEF2","DDEFL1","DGKI","DGKZ","DP58","DYSFIP1","EHMT1","EHMT2","ESPN","FANK1","FEM1A","FEM1B","GABPB2","GIT1","GIT2","GLS_(gene)","GLS2","HACE1","HECTD1","IBTK","ILK","INVS","KIDINS220","KRIT1","LOC348840","LOC554226","LRRK1","MAIL","MGC26718","MGC29891","MIB1_(gene)","MIB2","MPHOSPH8","MTPN","MYO16","NFKB1","NFKB2","NFKBIA","NFKBIB","NFKBIE","NFKBIL1","NFKBIL2","NOTCH1","NOTCH2","NOTCH3","NOTCH4","NRARP","NUDT12","OSBPL1A","OSTF1","PLA2G6","POTE14","POTE15","POTE8","PPP1R12A","PPP1R12B","PPP1R12C","PPP1R13B","PPP1R13L","PPP1R16A","PPP1R16B","PSMD10","RAI14","RFXANK","RIPK4","RNASEL","SHANK1","SHANK2","SHANK3","SNCAIP","TA-NFKBH","TEX14","TNKS","TNKS2","TNNI3K","TP53BP2","TRP7","TRPA1","TRPC3","TRPC4","TRPC5","TRPC6","TRPC7","TRPV1","TRPV2","TRPV3","TRPV4","TRPV5","TRPV6","UACA","USH1G","ZDHHC13","ZDHHC17","DARPin"]}
