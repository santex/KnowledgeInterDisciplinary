It was established in 1965 as an alliance of\nMapai and Ahdut HaAvoda but was dissolved three years later when the two parties\nand Rafi formally merged into the Israeli Labor Party. In 1969 a new party known\nas the Alignment was established through an alliance of the Israeli Labor Party\nand Mapam, at the time holding 63 Knesset seats, the only party ever to have\nheld an absolute majority of seats in the Knesset.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Alignment_(political_party)","recorded":1362687753,"links":23,"instances":["political_party","political_party","israel","political_party","israel","political_party","1980","israel","1984","political_party","israel","1976"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Political parties established in 1965","Political parties disestablished in 1968","Political parties established in 1969","Political parties disestablished in 1991","Defunct political parties in Israel","Zionist political parties in Israel","Coalitions of parties in Israel"],"headings":["First Alignment","Second Alignment","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Flag_of_Israel.svg/22px-Flag_of_Israel.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Emblem_of_Israel_alternative_blue-gold.svg/40px-Emblem_of_Israel_alternative_blue-gold.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Emblem_of_Israel.svg/40px-Emblem_of_Israel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rafi","political_party"],["liberal_party","israel"],["independent_liberals","israel"],["rafi","political_party"],["ratz","political_party"],["united_arab_list","1976"],["shlomtzion","political_party"],["telem","political_party"],["one_israel","1980"],["ometz","political_party"],["independent_liberals","israel"],["arab_democratic_party","israel"],["yachad","1984"],["the_dirty_trick","israel"]],"members":["telem","shlomtzion","arab_democratic_party","ometz","the_dirty_trick","ratz","one_israel","independent_liberals","yachad","rafi","liberal_party","united_arab_list"],"related":["Levi_Eshkol","Golda_Meir","Yitzhak_Rabin","Shimon_Peres","Israeli_Labor_Party","Labor_Zionism","Israeli_Labor_Party","Mapam","Israel","Mapai","Ahdut_HaAvoda","Rafi_(political_party)","Israeli_Labor_Party","Mapam","Knesset","Mapai","Ahdut_HaAvoda","Israeli_legislative_election,_1965","Right_wing_politics","Herut","Liberal_Party_(Israel)","Gahal","Israeli_legislative_election,_1951","Israeli_legislative_election,_1959","Levi_Eshkol","National_Religious_Party","Mapam","Independent_Liberals_(Israel)","Agudat_Israel_Workers","Israeli_Arab","Progress_and_Development","Cooperation_and_Brotherhood","Rafi_(political_party)","David_Ben-Gurion","National_List","Israeli_Labor_Party","Mapam","Golda_Meir","Prime_Minister_of_Israel","Six-Day_War","Israeli_legislative_election,_1969","Rogers_Plan","Meir_Avizohar","National_List","Yom_Kippur","Egypt","Syria","Yom_Kippur_War","Agranat_Commission","Likud","Defense_Minister_of_Israel","Moshe_Dayan","Yitzhak_Rabin","Shimon_Peres","Ratz_(political_party)","Arab_List_for_Bedouins_and_Villagers","United_Arab_List_(1976)","Aryeh_Eliav","Mordechai_Ben-Porat","Ya'ad_–_Civil_Rights_Movement","Independent_Socialist_Faction","Yadlin_affair","Asher_Yadlin","Avraham_Ofer","Leah_Rabin","Dollar_Account_affair","Shabbat","Israeli_Air_Force","William_B._Quandt","Israeli_legislative_election,_1977","Menachem_Begin","Shlomtzion_(political_party)","National_Religious_Party","Agudat_Israel","Democratic_Movement_for_Change","Ashkenazi_Jew","Mizrahi_Jew","Foreign_Minister_of_Israel","Telem_(political_party)","Camp_David_Accords","Israel-Egypt_Peace_Treaty","One_Israel_(1980)","Ometz_(political_party)","Tehiya","Yosef_Tamir","Ariel_Sharon","Yitzhak_Shamir","Meir_Amit","David_Golomb","Shinui","Israeli_legislative_election,_1981","Independent_Liberals_(Israel)","Israeli_legislative_election,_1984","Hadash","Progressive_List_for_Peace","Kach_and_Kahane_Chai","Agudat_Israel","Shas","Morasha","Yossi_Sarid","Yitzhak_Artzi","Arab_Democratic_Party_(Israel)","Abdulwahab_Darawshe","Yachad_(1984)","Israeli_legislative_election,_1988","Degel_HaTorah","Haredi_Judaism","Efraim_Gur","Unity_for_Peace_and_Immigration","The_dirty_trick_(Israel)","Israeli_Labor_Party"]}
