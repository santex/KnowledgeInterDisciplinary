The vector from an observer (origin) to a point of interest is projected\nperpendicularly onto a reference plane; the angle between the projected vector\nand a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.\n\nAn example is the position of a star in the sky. The star is the point of\ninterest, the reference plane is the horizon or the surface of the sea, and the\nreference vector points north. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector\nand the perpendicular projection of the star down onto the\nhorizon.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azimuth</ref>\n\nAzimuth is usually measured in degrees (°). The concept is used in navigation,\nastronomy, engineering, mapping, mining and artillery.\n","title":"azimuth","headings":["Navigation","Calculating azimuth","Mapping","Astronomy","Other systems","Other uses of the term","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Spherical_coordinate_system","2: Star","2: Sound_localization","1: Angle#Measuring_angles","1: Vector_space","1: Perpendicular","1: Horizon","1: Sea","1: North","1: Navigation","1: Astrometry","1: Engineering","1: Map","1: Artillery","1: Clockwise_and_counterclockwise","1: True_north","1: Angular_mil","1: Cardinal_point","1: Geographical_distance#Ellipsoidal-surface_formulae","1: World_Geodetic_System","1: Map_projection#Azimuthal_.28projections_onto_a_plane.29","1: Astronomy","1: Celestial_coordinate_system","1: Hour_angle","1: Culmination","1: Declination","1: Latitude","1: Celestial_equator","1: Right_ascension","1: Celestial_meridian","1: Horizontal_coordinate_system","1: Celestial_navigation","1: Satellite_dish","1: Coordinate_system","1: Sat_finder","1: Cylindrical_coordinate_system","1: Angle","1: Polar_coordinates","1: Radian","1: Theta","1: Tape_drive","1: Azimuth_thruster","1: Shipbuilding","1: Propeller","1: Azimuthal_quantum_number","1: Inclination","1: Longitude","1: Magnetic_declination","1: Solar_azimuth_angle","1: Zenith"]}
