The greatest change in blood\npressure and velocity of blood flow occurs at the transition of arterioles to\ncapillaries. This reduces the pressure and velocity of flow for gas and nutrient\nexchange to occur within the capillaries. Arterioles receive autonomic nervous\nsystem innervation and respond to various circulating hormones in order to\nregulate their diameter. Further local responses to stretch, carbon dioxide, pH,\nand oxygen also influence tone. Generally, norepinephrine and epinephrine\n(hormones produced by sympathetic nerves and the adrenal gland medulla)are\nvasoconstrictive acting on alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. However, the arterioles\nof skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and pulmonary circulation vasodilate in\nresponse to these hormones acting on beta-adrenergic receptors. Generally,\nstretch and high oxygen tension increase tone,and carbon dioxide and low pH\npromote vasodilation. Pulmonary arterioles are a noteworthy exception as they\nvasodilate to high oxygen. Brain arterioles are particularly sensitive to pH\nwith reduced pH promoting vasodilation. A number of hormones influce arteriole\ntone such as angiotensin II (vasoconstrictive), endothelin (vasoconstrictive),\nbradykinin (vasodilation), atrial natruretic peptide (vasodilation), and\nprostacyclin (vasodilation).\n\nBlood pressure in the arteries supplying the body is a result of the work needed\nto pump the cardiac output (the flow of blood pumped by the heart) through the\nvascular resistance, usually termed total peripheral resistance by physicians\nand researchers. An increase in the media to lumenal diameter ratio has been\nobserved in hypertensive arterioles (arteriolosclerosis) as the vascular wall\nthickens and/or lumenal diameter decreases.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Arteriole","recorded":1362538667,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Angiology"],"headings":["Natural fluctuation","Pathology","Medication","Metarterioles","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Illu_capillary.jpg/250px-Illu_capillary.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Rabbitarteriole100x1.jpg/250px-Rabbitarteriole100x1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Blood_vessel","Microcirculation","Artery","Capillary","Muscle","Smooth_muscle","Vascular_resistance","Autonomic_nervous_system","Hormones","Blood_pressure","Cardiac_output","Total_peripheral_resistance","Arteriolosclerosis","Arterial","Cardiac_output","Stroke_volume","Endothelium","Nitric_oxide","Polyphenol","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Enzyme","Arginine","Gap_junctions","Antihypertensive","Dihydropyridine","Nifedipine","Nicardipine","Calcium_channel_blocker","Metarteriole","Venule"]}
