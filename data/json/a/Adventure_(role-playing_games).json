{"cursor":"4565","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'adventure' is either a published or otherwise written collection of plot,\ncharacter, and location details used by a gamemaster to manage the plot or story\nin a role-playing game. Each adventure is based upon a particular gaming genre\nand is normally designed for use with a specific game or gaming system. However,\nskilled gamemasters can often convert an adventure to different game systems,\nand many adventures are designed with such conversions in mind.\n\nGenerally an adventure will have an overall goal to be accomplished by a party\nof player characters, and guidelines about the prerequisites for success. It\nthen subdivides the plot into a set of scenes that the players could encounter\nduring the course of play, and provide descriptions of the locations, details\non creatures and other characters that could be encountered, and information\nconcerning potential obstacles and hazards. The adventure will often contain\none or more maps that the gamemaster can use to locate points of interest and\nmanage movement.\n\n\"Dungeon crawl\"-style adventures for combat-intensive games such as [[Dungeons &\nDragons]] may allow or require large amounts of combat and little or no\ninteraction with other characters outside of combat; storytelling games such as\nthe [[World of Darkness]] games may focus on character interaction and provide\nlittle opportunity for combat. So-called linear adventures will restrict the\nactions of the players to a significant degree, requiring them to resolve each\npart of the plot in turn. Non-linear adventures are more flexible about the\norder of player activities, and allow the players a greater opportunity to\n\"write\" their own adventure.\n\nA common component of the adventure are the often colorfully written blocks of\ndescriptive text that are read out loud by the gamemaster to the players. These\nblocks (\"flavor text\") provide atmosphere for the game, and can provide clues\nabout what the players are about to face. Significant attention is spent\ndescribing important locations or plot stages, such as the player's introduction\nto the setting.\n\nThere are several broad categories of role-playing adventures:\n\n* A [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] is a lengthy adventure, or series\n  of adventures, that is run over many sessions. It is often designed to provide\n  a plot of epic scope, arranged in an episodic manner. The campaign normally\n  has a common theme holding it together, such as a major villainous opponent, a\n  great disaster, or an epic journey.\n* A scenario is shorter than a campaign, and can often be restricted to a\n  limited geographic location such as a town or a forest. It has a brief plot\n  that can be concluded within a few gaming sessions. Several related scenarios\n  can be strung together by a gamemaster to create a campaign. \"Campaign\" and\n  \"Scenario\" are derived from wargaming terminology, as early role-playing games\n  were derived from contemporary wargames.\n* The one-shot adventure is designed to be played in a single evening, and\n  usually involves battling a small group of opponents or resolving a difficult\n  or dangerous problem. A one-shot is often intended to demonstrate a new\n  setting or to hold a gaming session when many regular participants are not\n  able to make it that night. It will typically use pre-generated characters for\n  the players in order to limit start-up time.\n\nThere are a multitude of commercial adventures published as modules for\ndifferent published game worlds. However many gamemasters enjoy writing their\nown adventures, an activity that can require considerable effort and labor.\n\nDifferent games have different names for their adventures; for example, White\nWolf Game Studio calls their adventures \"chronicles\", while [[Dungeons &\nDragons]] adventures are often called \"modules\" or \"scenarios\" (\"module,\"\n\"scenario\" and \"campaign\" are all loanwords from the miniatures wargames that\nwere the hobby's roots). Games with televisual or cinematic pretensions often\ncall adventures \"episodes\" with a campaign referred to as a \"series.\"\n","linknr":119,"url":"Adventure_(role-playing_games)","recorded":1375069082,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Adventure!","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Publish","/wiki/Gamemaster","/wiki/Plot_(narrative)","/wiki/Narrative","/wiki/Role-playing_game","/wiki/Genre","/wiki/Player_characters","/wiki/Player_(game)","/wiki/Random_encounter","/wiki/Game_play","/wiki/Location_(geography)","/wiki/Lists_of_fictional_species","/wiki/Fictional_character","/wiki/Hazard","/wiki/Dungeon_crawl","/wiki/Combat","/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons","/wiki/Interaction","/wiki/Storytelling_game","/wiki/World_of_Darkness","/wiki/Plot_(narrative)","/wiki/Gamemaster","/wiki/Campaign_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Town","/wiki/Forest","/wiki/Gamemaster","/wiki/Wargaming","/wiki/Campaign_setting","/wiki/Gamemaster","/wiki/White_Wolf_Game_Studio","/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons","/wiki/Adventure_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)","/wiki/Miniatures_wargame","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&oldid=555802507","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Role-playing_game_terminology","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_February_2013","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Adventure+%28role-playing+games%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Adventure+%28role-playing+games%29","/wiki/Adventure_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Talk:Adventure_(role-playing_games)","#","/wiki/Adventure_(role-playing_games)","/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Adventure_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Adventure_(role-playing_games)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&oldid=555802507","/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1000492","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Adventure_%28role-playing_games%29&id=555802507","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Adventure+%28role-playing+games%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Adventure+%28role-playing+games%29&oldid=555802507&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Adventure_(role-playing_games)&printable=yes","//bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_(%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8_%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B8)","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollenspielabenteuer","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A9nario_de_jeu_de_r%C3%B4le","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avontuur_(rollenspel)","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B7%E3%83%8A%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA_(TRPG)","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przygoda_(gry_fabularne)","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seikkailupeli","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84ventyr_(rollspelsterm)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1000492#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licen
