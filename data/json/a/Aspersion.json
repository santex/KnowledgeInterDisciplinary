Psalm 77:16-20).\n\nIn addition, aspersion is performed as part of certain rites to remind people of\ntheir baptism, such as the renewal of baptismal vows performed by the Roman\nCatholic Church on Easter.\n\n'[[Wikt:aspersion|Aspersion]]' is also a normal English usage, usually in the\nphrase \"to cast aspersions uponâ€¦\", to mean an attack on somebody's\ncharacter or reputation.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Aspersion","recorded":1362372185,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Baptism","Water and religion","Christian terms"],"headings":["Apostolic times","Early Christianity","Later developments","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Latin","Religious","Water","Holy_water","Baptism","Affusion","Latin","Roman_Catholic_Church","Easter","St._Peter","Affusion","Cyprian","Ezekiel","Book_of_Numbers","Moses","Aspergilium","Roman_Catholic_Church","Conditional_baptism","Christian_denomination","Affusion"]}
