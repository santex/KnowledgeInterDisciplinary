{"cursor":"40064","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Adult stem cells' are undifferentiated cells, found throughout the body after\ndevelopment, that multiply by cell division to replenish dying cells and\nregenerate damaged tissues. Also known as '[[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[stem\ncells]]' (from Greek Î£ÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÃ³Ï, meaning of the body), they can be found in\njuvenile as well as adult animals and human bodies.\n\nScientific interest in adult stem cells is centered on their ability to divide\nor self-renew indefinitely, and generate all the cell types of the organ from\nwhich they originate, potentially regenerating the entire organ from a few\ncells. Unlike embryonic stem cells, the use of adult stem cells in research and\ntherapy is not considered to be controversial, as they are derived from adult\ntissue samples rather than destroyed human embryos. They have mainly been\nstudied in humans and model organisms such as mice and rats.\n","linknr":682,"url":"Adult_stem_cell","recorded":1362485043,"links":20,"instances":["biochemistry","anatomy","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stem cells","Biotechnology"],"headings":["Properties","Types","Adult stem cell therapies","Adult stem cells and cancer","Most Recent Research Presented by NIH","News and external links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Stem_cell_division_and_differentiation.svg/160px-Stem_cell_division_and_differentiation.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["organ","anatomy"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["lumen","anatomy"]],"members":["receptor","organ","lumen","cell"],"related":["Cell_differentiation","Cell_(biology)","Cell_division","Biological_tissue","Cell_type","Organ_(anatomy)","Embryonic_stem_cells","Stem_cell_controversy","Embryo","Model_organism","Mouse","Rat","Stem_cell","Cell_cycle","Cell_division","Multipotency","Offspring","Cell_type","Glial_cell","Neuron","Unipotent_cell","Unipotent","Indiana_Health_Law_Review","Indiana_University_Robert_H._McKinney_School_of_Law","International_Standard_Serial_Number","Library_of_Congress_Control_Number","Online_Computer_Library_Center","Clonogenic_assay","Cell_culture","Subpopulation","Progenitor_cell","Cell_differentiation","Molecular","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Transporter","ABC-Transporter_Genes","Active_transport","Multidrug_resistance","Notch_pathway","Haematopoietic","Neural","Mammary","Transdifferentiation","Growth_medium","Cell_culture","Bone_marrow","Mammary_gland","Gestation","Carcinogenesis","Cell_culture","Lumen_(anatomy)","Myoepithelial_cell","Intestinal_epithelial_differentiation_genes","Crypts_of_Lieberkühn","Placenta","Adipose_tissue","Lung","Bone_marrow","Wharton's_jelly","Umbilical_cord","Dental_pulp","Periodontal_ligament","Trophic_hormone","Innate_immune_response","Neurogenesis","Neuron","Subventricular_zone","Lateral_ventricles","Dentate_gyrus","Hippocampal_formation","Hippocampus","Ischemia","Neocortex","Neurospheres","Heterogeneous","Neuron","Glial","Progenitor_cell","Haematopoietic_stem_cell","Immune_system","Hair_follicle","Neural_crest","Gastrointestinal_tract","Sciatic_nerve","Dorsal_root_ganglion","Sympathetic_ganglia","Neuron","Schwann_cell","Myofibroblast","Chondrocyte","Melanocyte","Testicles","Germ_cell","Cellular_differentiation","Transdifferentiation","Pluripotent","Embryonic_stem_cells","Multipotent","Mesenchymal_stem_cell","Endothelial_progenitor_cell","Fibroblast","Leukemia","Stem_cell_controversy","Embryonic_stem_cells","Embryo","Hematopoietic","Hematopoietic","Paolo_Macchiarini","Barcelona","Colombian_people","Vertebrate_trachea","Tuberculosis","University_of_Padua","University_of_Bristol","Politecnico_di_Milano","Bronchus","Immunosuppressive","Epigenetic"]}
