{"cursor":"1509","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Achievement Improvement Monitor (AIM)' program was a testing scheme used to\nmonitor the development of literacy and numeracy skills of school students in\nVictoria, Australia. It ran for the first time in 2003.\n\nThe program was administered by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment\nAuthority (VCAA). Reading, writing, spelling and numeracy tests, based on the\nVictorian Essential Learning Standards (VELS), were undertaken by all Victorian\nstudents in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9. The results were used as feedback and guidance\nto students, parents and teachers, and were not used to grade students.\n\nSchools and parents were advised of each studentâs results against VELS. At each\ntest point, teachers could identify students who would benefit from enrichment\nactivities or who may require further development in specific aspects of the\ncurriculum.\n\nIn 2008, the Australia-wide NAPLAN tests replaced the AIM program.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Achievement_Improvement_Monitor","recorded":1362551709,"links":13,"instances":["australia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Education in Victoria (Australia)","Standardized tests in Australia"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Graduation_hat.svg/30px-Graduation_hat.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["victoria","australia"]],"members":["victoria"],"related":["Literacy","Numeracy","Victoria_(Australia)","Australia","Victorian_Curriculum_and_Assessment_Authority","Victorian_Essential_Learning_Standards","NAPLAN"]}
