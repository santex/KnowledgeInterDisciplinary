It is also called 'aegeom' which literally means \"covering a\nforehead\" in Korean. There is a historical record which mentions that officials\nin a low class called iseo (ì´ì, ) wore ayam in the early Joseon period, so it\nwas a unisex cap. However, it is not clear whether the shape at that time was\nidentical to that of the later period. During the late Joseon period, an ayam\nwas usually worn by female commoners. Especially in the western part of Korea,\n[[kisaeng]] (female Korean entertainers) commonly wore an ayam, and they were\nalso worn as a simple formal headgear.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Ayam_(cap)","recorded":1362566450,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Korean headgear","Caps"],"headings":["Composition","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Korean_hat-Ayam-01.jpg/200px-Korean_hat-Ayam-01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Korea","Cap","Joseon_period","Korean_language","Headgear","Quilt","Flannel","Tassel","Braid","Jade","Amber","Orpiment","Jokduri","Jobawi","Hwagwan","Mob_cap","Tubeteika","Hanbok","List_of_Korean_clothing"]}
