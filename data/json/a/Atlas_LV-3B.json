It was derived\nfrom the SM-65D Atlas missile, and was a member of the Atlas family of rockets.\n\nNine LV-3Bs were launched, two on unmanned suborbital test flights, three on\nunmanned orbital test flights, and four with manned Mercury spacecraft. [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/atlas.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica -\nAtlas] Atlas LV-3B launches were conducted from Launch Complex 14 at Cape\nCanaveral Air Force Station, Florida.\n\nIt first flew on 29 July 1960, conducting the suborbital Mercury-Atlas 1 test\nflight. The rocket suffered a structural failure shortly after launch, and as a\nresult failed to place the spacecraft onto its intended trajectory. In addition\nto the maiden flight, the first orbital launch, Mercury-Atlas 3 also failed.\nThis failure was due to a problem with the guidance system failing to execute\npitch and roll commands, necessitating that the Range Safety Officer destroy the\nvehicle. The spacecraft separated by means of its launch escape system and was\nrecovered from the launch pad.\n\nA further series of Mercury launches was planned, which would have used\nadditional LV-3Bs; however these flights were canceled after the success of the\ninitial Mercury missions. The last LV-3B launch was conducted on 15 May 1963,\nfor the launch of Mercury-Atlas 9.\n","linknr":602,"url":"Atlas_LV-3B","recorded":1362267821,"links":27,"instances":["rocket_family"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rockets and missiles","Atlas (rocket family)"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Launch_of_Friendship_7_-_GPN-2000-000686.jpg/270px-Launch_of_Friendship_7_-_GPN-2000-000686.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Atlas-F.jpg/130px-Atlas-F.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Mercury_Capsule2.png/70px-Mercury_Capsule2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/RocketSunIcon.svg/28px-RocketSunIcon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Shuttle.svg/20px-Shuttle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["atlas","rocket_family"]],"members":["atlas"],"related":["Mercury-Atlas_6","Expendable_launch_system","Convair","RP-1","LOX","RP-1","LOX","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Launch_Complex_14","Man_rating","Expendable_launch_system","United_States","Project_Mercury","Astronaut","Low_Earth_orbit","SM-65D_Atlas","Atlas_(rocket_family)","Human_spaceflight","Mercury_spacecraft","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Launch_Complex_14","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Mercury-Atlas_1","Mercury-Atlas_3","Range_Safety_Officer","Launch_escape_system","Mercury-Atlas_9","Mercury-Redstone_Launch_Vehicle","SM-65_Atlas"]}
