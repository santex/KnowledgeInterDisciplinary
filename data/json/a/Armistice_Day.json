While this official date to mark the end of the war\nreflects the ceasefire on the Western Front, hostilities continued in other\nregions, especially across the former Russian Empire and in parts of the old\nOttoman Empire.\n\nThe date was declared a national holiday in many allied nations, to commemorate\nthose members of the armed forces who were killed during war. An exception is\nItaly, where the end of the war is commemorated on 4 November, the day of the\nArmistice of Villa Giusti.\n\nThe Initial or Very First Armistice Day was held at Buckingham Palace commencing\nwith King George V hosting a \"Banquet in Honour of The President of the French\nRepublic\" during the evening hours of November 10 1919. The First Official\nArmistice Day was subsequently held on the Grounds of Buckingham Palace on the\nMorning of November 11th 1919. This would set the trend for a day of Remembrance\nfor decades to come.\n\nAfter World War II, the name of the holiday was changed to Veterans Day in the\nUnited States and to Remembrance Day in the countries of the British\nCommonwealth of Nations. Armistice Day remains an official holiday in France and\nBelgium. From 2012, Armistice Day is an official holiday in Serbia.\n\nIn the U.S., the function of Veterans Day is subtly different from that of other\n11 November holidays. Unlike the situation in other countries, where that\ncalendar date is set aside specifically for honoring those who died in action,\nVeterans Day honors all American veterans, whether living, dead in action, or\ndeceased from other causes. The official national remembrance of war dead\ninstead falls on the late-May holiday of Memorial Day, which became entrenched\nin that role in the decades immediately following the Civil War.\n\nIn many parts of the world, people observe two consecutive minutes moment of\nsilence at 11:00 a.m. local time as a sign of respect in the first minute\nfor the roughly 20 million people who died in the war, and in the second minute\ndedicated to the living left behind, generally understood to be wives, children\nand families left behind but deeply affected by the conflict. This gesture of\nrespect was suggested by Edward George Honey in a letter to a British newspaper,\nalthough Wellesley Tudor Pole had established two ceremonial periods of\nremembrance based on events in 1917.\n\nFrom the outset, many veterans in many countries have also used silence to pay\nhomage to departed comrades. The toast of \"Fallen\" or \"Absent Comrades\" has\nalways been honoured in silence at New Zealand veteran functions, while the news\nof a memberâs death has similarly been observed in silence at meetings.\n\nSimilar ceremonies developed in other countries during the inter-war period. In\nSouth Africa, for example, the Memorable Order of Tin Hats had by the late 1920s\ndeveloped a ceremony whereby the toast of \"Fallen Comrades\" was observed not\nonly in silence but darkness, all except for the \"Light of Remembrance\", with\nthe ceremony ending with the Orderâs anthem \"Old Soldiers Never Die\". In\nAustralia, meanwhile, the South Australian State Branch of the Returned Sailors\n& Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia similarly developed during the interwar\nperiod a simple ceremony of silence for departed comrades at 9 p.m.,\npresumably to coincide with the traditional 11 a.m. time for Armistice\nceremonies taking place in Europe (due to the ten-hour time difference between\nEastern Australia and Europe).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, beginning in 1939, the two-minute silence was moved to\nthe Sunday nearest to 11 November in order not to interfere with wartime\nproduction should 11 November fall on a weekday. After the end of World War II,\nmost Armistice Day events were moved to the nearest Sunday and began to\ncommemorate both World Wars. The change was made in many Commonwealth countries,\nas well as the United Kingdom, and the new commemoration was named Remembrance\nSunday or Remembrance Day. Both Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday are now\ncommemorated formally in the UK. In recent years Armistice Day has become\nincreasingly recognised, and many people now attend the 11am ceremony at the\nCenotaph in London - an event organised by The Western Front Association, a UK\ncharity dedicated to perpetuating the memory of those who served in the First\nWorld War.
