{"cursor":"19351","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Archibald Montgomery Low' (1888 - 13 September 1956) was an\nEnglish consulting engineer, research physicist and inventor, and author of more\nthan 40 books.\n\nLow has been called the '\"father of radio guidance systems\"' due to his\npioneering work on guided rockets, planes and torpedoes. He was a pioneer in\nmany fields though, often leading the way for others, but his lack of discipline\nmeant he hardly ever saw a project through, being easily distracted by new\nideas. If it weren't for this inability to see things to a conclusion, Low could\nwell have been remembered as one of the great men of science. Many of his\nscientific contemporaries disliked him, due in part to his using the title\n[[Professor]], which technically he wasn't entitled to do as he didn't occupy an\nacademic chair. His love of the limelight and publicity probably also added to\nthe dislike.\n\nArchibald M. Low was one of the first forecasters of the concept of television\nin the early\n1920s.
