The\ncampus covers , and has more than 50 playgrounds, football pitches, a swimming\npool, and an athletics stadium.\n\nFounded in 1944, it educates 4,200 children (mainly boys) from Kindergarten\nthrough to Mathayom 6 (Grade 12). Former Thai Prime Ministers and leading\nfigures were educated at Assumption colleges and universities.\n\nIn 1994, the Ministry of Education certified ACS as an Excellent Educational\nInstitution, recognising the schoolâs achievements in academic studies.\nAssumption College Si Racha runs several English-language programmes and employs\nnative-speaking English teachers.\n\nACS is one of 14 institutions run by the Saint Gabrielâs Foundation in Thailand,\nwhich was established in 1944. During the Second World War, the Assumption\nCollege in Bangkok was damaged by bombing. The school had to close temporarily,\nand in November 1942 its group of Brothers moved to Si Racha to open a new,\ntemporary, school. At the time, the location was a wild lemon grass and\npineapple farm. After the war, Assumption College reopened in Bangkok, but\nhostels for students were damaged and so some pupils remained in Si Racha.\n\nThe school is around 100 kilometres from Bangkok and close to the popular\ntourist resorts of Pattaya and Jomtien.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Assumption_College_Sriracha","recorded":1362585525,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Christian schools in Thailand","Educational institutions established in 1944","1944 establishments in Thailand","Chonburi Province"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Flag_of_Thailand.svg/30px-Flag_of_Thailand.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Catholic","Thailand","Amphoe_Si_Racha","Chonburi_Province","Saint_Gabriel’s_Foundation","Bangkok","Pattaya","Jomtien"]}
