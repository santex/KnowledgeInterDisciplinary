People who fly aboard an aircraft, such as passengers and cabin crew,\nwho are not involved in the aircraft's flight systems are not generally\nconsidered aviators, but crew such as navigators, and flight engineers are\ngenerally included.\n\nTo ensure the safety of people in the air and on the ground, early aviation soon\nrequired that aircraft be under the operational control of a properly trained,\ncertified, and current pilot at all times, who is responsible for the safe and\nlegal completion of the flight. The AÃ©ro-Club de France delivered the first\ncertificate to Louis BlÃ©riot in 1908âfollowed by Glenn Curtiss, LÃ©on Delagrange,\nand Robert Esnault-Pelterie. The absolute authority given to the \"pilot in\ncommand\" derives from that of a ship's captain.\n\nIn recognition of the pilots' qualifications and responsibilities, most\nmilitaries and many airlines worldwide award aviator badges to their pilots, as\nwell as other air crews. This includes naval aviators.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term aviator (aviateur in French) was in 1887, as\na variation of \"aviation\", from the Latin avis (meaning bird), coined in 1863 by\nG. de la Landelle in Aviation Ou Navigation AÃ©rienne (\"Aviation or Air\nNavigation\"). The term aviatrix (aviatrice in French), now archaic, was formerly\nused for a female aviator. These terms were used more in the early days of\naviation, before anyone had ever seen an airplane fly, and it was used to denote\nbravery and adventure. For example, the editors at the [[Dayton Herald]], (in an\narticle of December 18, 1903) described the Wright brothers' first airplane:\n\"The weight, including the body of the aviator, is slightly over 700 pounds\".\n","linknr":463,"url":"Aviator","recorded":1362576173,"links":90,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aviators|","Military aviation occupations","Occupations in aviation"],"headings":["Civilian","Military","Pilot certifications","Pilots in space","Aviatrices (female aviators)","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Lt_Mike_Hunter_1.jpg/220px-Lt_Mike_Hunter_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/3c07354v.jpg/220px-3c07354v.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/28/Basket_and_crew.jpg/220px-Basket_and_crew.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Short_finals_to_RW22R_at_NCE_Airport.jpg/220px-Short_finals_to_RW22R_at_NCE_Airport.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/USAF_pilot.jpg/220px-USAF_pilot.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Beverly_Burns.jpg/220px-Beverly_Burns.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/F-15_Eagle_female_pilots%2C_3rd_Wing.jpg/220px-F-15_Eagle_female_pilots%2C_3rd_Wing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Lieutenant","Flight_suit","Monoplane","Aircraft","Flight","Navigator","Flight_engineer","Aviation","Aéro-Club_de_France","Louis_Blériot","Glenn_Curtiss","Léon_Delagrange","Robert_Esnault-Pelterie","Pilot_in_command","Aviator_badge","Aircrew","Naval_aviator","Aviation_history","Wright_brothers","Pilot_in_command","Air_Commerce_Act","Nation-state","Combat","Weapon","Fighter_pilot","Test_pilot","Astronaut","Air_Force_One","Air_Force_Two","Flight_training","Private_Pilot_License","Instrument_Rating","Commercial_Pilot_License","Airline_Transport_Pilot_License","Multi_Crew_Coordination","Human_spaceflight","Astronaut","Spacecraft","Space_Shuttle","Co-pilot","Raymonde_de_Laroche","Helene_Dutrieu","Marie_Marvingt","English_Channel","North_Sea","Eugenie_Mikhailovna_Shakhovskaya","Harriet_Quimby","English_Channel","Amelia_Earhart","Bessie_Coleman","African_American","Opal_Kunz","Civilian_Pilot_Training_Program","Edith_Maud_Cook","Hilda_Hewlett","Amy_Johnson","Valérie_André","Indochina","Jean_Batten","Sabiha_Gökçen","Air_Education_and_Training_Command","Night_Witches","Soviet_Air_Forces","Harassment","Bomb","Precision_bombing","Elmendorf_Air_Force_Base","Women_Airforce_Service_Pilots","American_Airlines","JAL_Express","Hanadi_Zakaria_al-Hindi","Saudi_Arabia","Arab_News","Air_safety","IMSAFE","List_of_aerospace_engineers","List_of_aviators","List_of_Russian_aviators","Women_Of_Aviation_Worldwide_Week"]}
