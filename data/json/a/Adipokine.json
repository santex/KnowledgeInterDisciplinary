However, conflicting data exists about what is termed a cytokine and what\nis termed a hormone and more research is needed in this area of defining\ncytokines and hormones. Under the current terminology, adiponectin, leptin (Ob\nligand), and resistin are not appropriately considered adipokines (cytokines) as\nthey do not act on the immune system. (Harrison's Principles of Internal\nMedicine). Often, these peptides (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin) are\nreferred to as adipokines, however they can be more accurately put into the\nlarger, growing list of adipose derived hormones.\n","linknr":188,"url":"Adipokine","recorded":1362485052,"links":19,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cytokines"],"headings":["Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Cytokine","Cell_(biology)","Protein","Adipose_tissue","Chemerin","Interleukin-6","CCL2","Plasminogen_activator_inhibitor-1","Retinol_binding_protein","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Visfatin","Leptin","Adiponectin","Apelin","Cytokine","Adiponectin","Leptin","Resistin","Adiponectin","Leptin","Resistin","Adipose_derived_hormones"]}
