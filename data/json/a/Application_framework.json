Developers usually use object-oriented programming\ntechniques to implement frameworks such that the unique parts of an application\ncan simply inherit from pre-existing classes in the framework.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Application_framework","recorded":1362559139,"links":13,"instances":["computing","framework","software","software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer programming tools"],"headings":["Examples","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["carbon","computing"],["cocoa","software"],["eclipse","software"],["qt","framework"],["eclipse","software"]],"members":["carbon","qt","cocoa","eclipse"],"related":["Computer_programming","Software_framework","Software_developer","Application_software","Graphical_user_interface","Object-oriented","Apple_Computer","MacApp","Apple_Macintosh","Pascal_programming_language","C++","PowerPlant","MacZoop","Carbon_(computing)","Cocoa_(software)","Mac_OS_X","OPENSTEP","NeXT","Free-software","Mozilla_application_framework","OpenOffice.org","GNOME","KDE","NetBeans","Eclipse_(software)","Microsoft","Microsoft_Windows","Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library","Linux","Qt_(framework)","Widget_toolkit","WxWidgets","FOX_toolkit","Eclipse_(software)","Oracle_Application_Development_Framework","Java_programming_language"]}
