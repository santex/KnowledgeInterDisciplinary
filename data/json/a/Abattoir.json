Slaughterhouses which process meat not\nintended for human consumption are sometimes referred to as Knacker's yards or\nKnackeries.\n\nIn the United States, around nine billion animals are slaughtered every year.\n(this includes about 150.4 million cattle, bison, sheep, hogs, and goats and 8.9\nbillion chickens, turkeys, and ducks; in 2009, of beef were consumed in the U.S.\nalone. [http://www.ers.usda.gov/news/BSECoverage.htm \"U.S. Beef and Cattle\nIndustry\"], United States Department of Agriculture, cited in Torres, Bob.\nMaking a Killing. AK Press, 2007, p. 45. In Canada, 650 million animals\nare killed\nannually. [http://www.gan.ca/campaigns/slaughterhouses/index.en.html\n\"Slaughterhouses\"], Global Action Network. Retrieved March 18, 2008. In\nthe European Union, the annual figure is 300 million cattle, sheep, and pigs,\nand four billion (an unverified number) chickens.\n\nSlaughtering animals on a large scale poses significant logistical problems and\npublic health requirements. Public aversion to meat packing in many cultures\ninfluences the location of slaughterhouses. In addition, some religions\nstipulate certain conditions for the slaughter of animals.\n\nThere has been criticism of the methods of transport, preparation, herding, and\nkilling within some slaughterhouses, and in particular of the speed with which\nthe slaughter is sometimes conducted. Investigations by animal welfare and\nanimal rights groups have indicated that in some cases animals are skinned or\ngutted while alive and conscious. In some cases animals are driven for hundreds\nof miles to slaughterhouses in conditions that often result in injuries and\ndeath en route. See, for example, Vansickle, J. \"Quality Assurance Program\nLaunched,\" National Hog Farmer, February 15, 2002, which reports that each year\n420,000 pigs are crippled and 170,000 killed during transport to\nslaughterhouses, cited in Williams, Erin E. and DeMello, Margo. Why Animals\nMatter. Prometheus Books, 2007, p. 49. Slaughtering animals is opposed by\nanimal rights groups on ethical grounds.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Abattoir","recorded":1362503686,"links":63,"instances":["enclosure","number","industrial","method_used_to_slaughter_animals"],"pdf":["http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/oie/downloads/tahc_mar07/tahc-guide-slau-ans-mar07.pdf","http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/oie/downloads/tahc_mar07/tahc-guide-slau-ans-mar07.pdf"],"categories":["Livestock","Animal
