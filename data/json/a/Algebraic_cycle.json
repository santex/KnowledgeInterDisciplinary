{"cursor":"4912","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, an 'algebraic cycle' on an algebraic variety V is, roughly\nspeaking, a homology class on V that is represented by a linear combination of\nsubvarieties of V. Therefore the algebraic cycles on V are the part of the\nalgebraic topology of V that is directly accessible in algebraic geometry. With\nthe formulation of some fundamental conjectures in the 1950s and 1960s, the\nstudy of algebraic cycles became one of the main objectives of the algebraic\ngeometry of general varieties.\n\nThe nature of the difficulties is quite plain: the existence of algebraic cycles\nis easy to predict, but the current methods of constructing them are deficient.\nThe major conjectures on algebraic cycles include the Hodge conjecture and the\nTate conjecture. In the search for a proof of the Weil conjectures, Alexander\nGrothendieck and Enrico Bombieri formulated what are now known as the standard\nconjectures of algebraic cycle theory.\n\nAlgebraic cycles have also been shown to be closely connected with\nalgebraic K-theory.\n\nFor the purposes of a well-working intersection theory, one uses various\nequivalence relations on algebraic cycles. Particularly important is the so-\ncalled rational equivalence. Cycles up to rational equivalence form a graded\nring, the Chow ring, whose multiplication is given by the intersection product.\nFurther fundamental relations include algebraic equivalence, numerical\nequivalence, and homological equivalence. They have (partly conjectural)\napplications in the theory of motives.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Algebraic_cycle","recorded":1362478000,"links":0,"instances":["scheme_theory","mathematics","algebraic_geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebraic geometry"],"headings":["Definition","Flat pullback and proper pushforward","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["motive","algebraic_geometry"],["scheme","mathematics"],["function_field","scheme_theory"]],"members":["function_field","scheme","motive"],"related":["Mathematics","Algebraic_variety","Homology_class","Subvarieties","Algebraic_topology","Algebraic_geometry","Hodge_conjecture","Tate_conjecture","Weil_conjectures","Alexander_Grothendieck","Enrico_Bombieri","Standard_conjectures_on_algebraic_cycles","Algebraic_K-theory","Intersection_theory","Equivalence_relations_on_algebraic_cycles","Chow_ring","Intersection_product","Motive_(algebraic_geometry)","Scheme_(mathematics)","Irreducible_component","Reduced_scheme","Closed_subscheme","Generic_point","Zariski_topology","Flat_morphism","Proper_morphism","Function_field_(scheme_theory)","Finite_morphism","Chow_ring"]}
