[http://www.aspect.org.uk/about/history/ History], Aspect\nMembership rose to around 200 by the mid-1920s, and the organisation affiliated\nto NALGO for representation and negotiation for some years. The two unions then\nseparated due to policy differences, but membership continued its slow rise,\nreaching 800 in 1970.

In\n1977, it first gained its Certificate of Independence. By 1980, membership had\nreached 1,400, and the union affiliated to the National Association of Head\nTeachers for the provision of some services. Under the\nsecretaryship of Bill Wright, in 1993, the union once again asserted its\nindependence, and renamed itself as the 'National Association of Educational\nInspectors, Advisers and Consultants' (NAEIAC).\n\nThe union appointed John Chowcat as its first full-time general secretary in\n1999, and affiliated to the Trades Union Congress in 2002. In 2005, membership\nreached 4,000, and it adopted its most recent name, a backronym for \"Association\nof Professionals in Education and Children's Trusts\".\n\nIn 2012, the union merged into\nProspect. \"[http://www.prospect.org.uk/news/id/2011/01243 Aspect education\nunion votes to transfer into Prospect]\", Prospect, 7 December 2011\n","linknr":159,"url":"Aspect_(trade_union)","recorded":1362899131,"links":11,"instances":["trade_union"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organizations established in 1919","Former British trade unions","Education trade unions","1919 establishments in the United Kingdom","2012 disestablishments in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["prospect","trade_union"],["prospect","trade_union"]],"members":["prospect"],"related":["United_Kingdom","Trades_Union_Congress","Prospect_(trade_union)","Woolley,_West_Yorkshire","Trade_union","United_Kingdom","NALGO","National_Association_of_Head_Teachers","Trades_Union_Congress","Backronym","Prospect_(trade_union)"]}
