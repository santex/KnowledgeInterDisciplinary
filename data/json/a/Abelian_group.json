{"cursor":"24089","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn abstract algebra, an 'abelian group', also called a 'commutative group', is a\ngroup in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements\ndoes not depend on their order (the axiom of commutativity). Abelian groups\ngeneralize the arithmetic of addition of integers. They are named after Niels\nHenrik Abel. Jacobson (2009), p. 41\n\nThe concept of an abelian group is one of the first concepts encountered in\nundergraduate abstract algebra, with many other basic objects, such as a module\nand a vector space, being its refinements. The theory of abelian groups is\ngenerally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite\nabelian groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of\ninfinite abelian groups is an area of current research.\n","linknr":453,"url":"Abelian_group","recorded":1362685143,"links":56,"instances":["structure","mathematics","abelian_group","mathematics","mathematics","logic","mathematics","ring_theory","group_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abelian group theory","Properties of groups","Niels Henrik Abel"],"headings":["Definition","Facts","Examples","Historical remarks","Properties","Finite abelian groups","Infinite abelian groups","Relation to other mathematical topics","A note on the typography","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/b/f0b250262c573a9c7bc2b66ab6d8e32f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/3/f/e3f018c6720a88a3686bcb95b0060373.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/1/8/418249d0329543bb6fc364076d6f9597.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/6/4365c189d45c35beff31296f031a8324.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/c/50c16f8280e4abd86a82ec25e59476c6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/5/c/75cb5efb83bbcf4e7d2d2e309d7ac862.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/e/f/2efd7028360a06a6f3b1bfb26ad2ccae.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/7/6/976492f71d81b19d62bbb8396f15518f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/a/1/da1a795646b9d30005f9b6b420299336.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["group","mathematics"],["operation","mathematics"],["module","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["element","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["module","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"],["unit","ring_theory"],["matrix","mathematics"],["module","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"],["module","mathematics"],["order","group_theory"],["height","abelian_group"],["ring","mathematics"],["boolean_algebra","structure"],["decidability","logic"]],"members":["boolean_algebra","ring","height","matrix","element","decidability","group","unit","order","operation","module","set"],"related":["Abstract_algebra","Group_(mathematics)","Operation_(mathematics)","Commutativity","Generalization","Arithmetic","Integer","Niels_Henrik_Abel","Module_(mathematics)","Vector_space","Nonabelian_group","Set_(mathematics)","Binary_operation","Element_(mathematics)","Commutative","Group_(mathematics)","Module_(mathematics)","Ring_(mathematics)","Finite_group","Cayley_table","Multiplication_table","If_and_only_if","Integer","Addition","Additive_identity","Additive_inverse","Cyclic_group","Integer","Modular_arithmetic","Ring_theory","Commutative_ring","Unit_(ring_theory)","Multiplicative_group","Real_number","Subgroup","Normal_subgroup","Quotient_group","Direct_sum_of_groups","Matrix_(mathematics)","Rotation_matrix","Norway","Mathematician","Niels_Henrik_Abel","Camille_Jordan","Polynomial","Solvability_by_radicals","Natural_number","Module_(mathematics)","Ring_(mathematics)","Module_(mathematics)","Principal_ideal_domain","Finitely_generated_abelian_group","Structure_theorem_for_finitely_generated_modules_over_a_principal_ideal_domain","Group_homomorphism","Dimension","Vector_space","Cardinal_number","Linearly_independent","Rational_number","Modular_arithmetic","Automorphism_group","Georg_Frobenius","Ludwig_Stickelberger","Linear_algebra","Prime_number","Fundamental_theorem_of_finitely_generated_abelian_groups","Rank_of_an_abelian_group","Coprime","Divisor","Group_isomorphism","List_of_small_groups","Coprime","Sylow_theorems","Cyclic_group","General_linear_group","Infinite_cyclic_group","Finitely_generated_abelian_group","Cyclic_group","Rank_of_an_abelian_group","Divisible_group","Prüfer_group","Injective_module","Baer's_criterion","Order_(group_theory)","Prüfer_theorems","Height_(abelian_group)","Direct_product","Helmut_Ulm","Ulm_invariant","Torsion-free_abelian_group","Free_abelian_group","Cotorsion_group","Algebraically_compact_module","P-adic_integer","Slender_group","Torsion_subgroup","Rank_of_an_abelian_group","Linearly_independent","Torsion-free_abelian_groups_of_rank_1","P-adic_integer","Pure_subgroup","Basic_subgroup","Irving_Kaplansky","Phillip_Griffith","Ring_(mathematics)","Tensor_product","Topology","Topological_group","Group_homomorphism","Category_of_abelian_groups","Abelian_category","Algebraic_structure","Boolean_algebra_(structure)","Decidability_(logic)","Torsion-free_abelian_groups_of_rank_1","Set_theory","Whitehead_problem","Free_abelian_group","Saharon_Shelah","List_of_statements_undecidable_in_ZFC","Axiomatic_set_theory","ZFC","Generalized_continuum_hypothesis","Constructible_universe","Statements_true_in_L","Adjective","Proper_name","Mathematician","Abelianization","Class_field_theory","Commutator_subgroup","Dihedral_group_of_order_6","Elementary_abelian_group","Pontryagin_duality","Pure_injective_module","Pure_projective_module"]}
