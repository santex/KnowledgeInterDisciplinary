Being part of the region Rhône-Alpes and bordered by the\nrivers Saône and Rhône, the department of Ain enjoys a privileged geographic\nsituation. It has an excellent transport network (TGV, highways) and benefits\nfrom the proximity to the international airports of Lyon and Geneva.\n\nAin is composed of four geographically different areas (Bresse, Dombes, Bugey\nand Pays de Gex) which – each with its own characteristics – contribute to the\ndiversity and the dynamic economic development of the department. In the Bresse\nagriculture and agro-industry are dominated by the cultivation of cereals,\ncattle breeding, milk and cheese production as well as poultry farming. In the\nDombes, pisciculture assumes greater importance as does wine making in the\nBugey. The high diversification of the department's industry is accompanied by a\nstrong presence of the plastics sector in and around Oyonnax (so-called\n\"Plastics Valley\").\n\nDue to its diverse industrial character and the cooperation of small and medium\nenterprises, Ain ranks among the departments with the fastest growing economy in\nthe country. Its unemployment rate lies far beneath the national and regional\naverage. Besides the export-oriented SME's, several large enterprises, with a\nprominent position on national and international markets, have settled in the\ndepartment.\n\nAlthough looking ahead, Ain attaches nevertheless great importance to its\nhistorical and cultural heritage as illustrated by its gastronomy (restaurant\nof Georges Blanc in Vonnas), its annual poultry competitions in the Bresse\n(\"the three glorious\") and its tourism (346 classified monuments such as the\nfamous church of Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse, 14 museums of France, eco-tourism and\nski tourism).\n","title":"ain","headings":["History","Geography and transport networks","Demographics","Economy","Research and higher education","Administration and Representatives","External links","References"]},"micro-relation":["8: Bourg-en-Bresse","6: Gex,_Ain","5: Bresse","5: Dombes","5: Bugey","5: Oyonnax","4: Lyon","4: Bellegarde-sur-Valserine","3: Departments_of_France","3: Belley","3: Nantua","3: Rachel_Mazuir","3: Saône","3: Geneva","3: Royal_Monastery_of_Brou","2: Prefectures_in_France","2: Rhône-Alpes","2: Arrondissements_of_the_Ain_department","2: Cantons_of_the_Ain_department","2: Communes_of_the_Ain_department","2: Rhône","2: TGV","2: Small_and_medium_enterprises","2: INSEE","2: Bellignat","2: Arrondissement_of_Gex","2: Ambérieu-en-Bugey","2: Union_for_a_Popular_Movement","1: Regions_of_France","1: Subprefectures_in_France","1: President_of_the_general_council","1: List_of_French_departments_by_population","1: Arrondissements_of_France","1: Cantons_in_France","1: Communes_in_France","1: Central_European_Time","1: Central_European_Summer_Time","1: Estuary","1: Arpitan","1: Ain_River","1: Pays_de_Gex","1: Pisciculture","1: Wine_making","1: Plastics_industry","1: Unemployment_rate","1: Vonnas","1: Menhir","1: Julius_Caesar","1: Helvetians","1: Gallic_Wars","1: Merovingians","1: Order_of_Saint_Benedict","1: Lothar_I","1: Treaty_of_Verdun","1: Fiefdom","1: Bâgé-la-Ville","1: Coligny,_Ain","1: Romanic","1: Savoy","1: Valromey","1: Dauphiné","1: Gothic_architecture","1: Margaret_of_Habsburg","1: Philibert_II,_Duke_of_Savoy","1: Francis_I_of_France","1: Louis_XV","1: French_Revolution","1: Léman","1: French_Consulate","1: Congress_of_Vienna","1: First_French_Empire","1: Curé_of_Ars","1: Barrage_de_Génissiat","1: Cerdon,_Ain","1: Izieu","1: French_resistance","1: Jura_mountains","1: Crêt_de_la_Neige","1: Lake_Geneva","1: Reyssouze_River","1: Veyle","1: Chalaronne","1: Rhone","1: Suran","1: Lyon-Saint_Exupéry_Airport","1: Jassans-Riottier","1: Côtière","1: Brénod","1: Plastics_Valley","1: Grièges","1: Gîtes","1: Cize-Bolozon_viaduct","1: Fort_l'Écluse","1: Saint-Trivier-de-Courtes","1: Pérouges","1: Les_Plus_Beaux_Villages_de_France","1: Jean_Moulin","1: DEUG","1: Maîtrise","1: CERN","1: Large_Hadron_Collider","1: Arrondissement_of_Belley","1: Arrondissement_of_Bourg-en-Bresse","1: Arrondissement_of_Nantua","1: Pierre_Soubelet","1: Pierre-Henri_Vray","1: Pascal_Gauci","1: René_Duchamp","1: Olivier_Laurens-Bernard","1: Christian_Michalak","1: French_cantonal_elections,_2008","1: Left_Radical_Party","1: French_National_Assembly","1: Charles_de_La_Verpillière","1: Xavier_Breton","1: Étienne_Blanc","1: Michel_Voisin","1: French_Senate","1: Jacques_Berthou","1: Sylvie_Goy-Chavent"]}
