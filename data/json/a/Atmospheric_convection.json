{"cursor":"23750","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Atmospheric convection' is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or\ntemperature difference, layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within\ndry and moist air lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which\nexpands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds,\ncumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection\nleads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather\nthroughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail,\ndownbursts, and tornadoes.\n","linknr":328,"url":"Atmospheric_convection","recorded":1362540658,"links":29,"instances":["meteorology","physics","meteorology","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://www.flame.org/~cdoswell/publications/Overview_Chapter.pdf","http://vortexengine.ca/misc/Renno_2008.pdf","http://vortexengine.ca/misc/Renno_2008.pdf"],"categories":["Severe weather and convection","Atmospheric thermodynamics"],"headings":["Overview","Initiation","Concerns regarding severe deep moist convection","Measurement","Other forecasting concerns","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/CAPE_vs_SHEAR.png/350px-CAPE_vs_SHEAR.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Thunderstorm_formation.jpg/500px-Thunderstorm_formation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Hailshaft.jpg/220px-Hailshaft.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Hail_clouds.jpg/220px-Hail_clouds.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/F5_tornado_Elie_Manitoba_2007.jpg/220px-F5_tornado_Elie_Manitoba_2007.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drag","physics"],["entrainment","meteorology"],["shortwave","meteorology"],["precipitation","meteorology"]],"members":["shortwave","drag","precipitation","entrainment"],"related":["Air_parcel","Planetary_boundary_layer","Cumulus_cloud","Dew_point","Thunderstorm","Severe_weather","Hail","Downburst","Tornado","Archetype","Convection","Lapse_rate","Level_of_free_convection","Free_convective_layer","Equilibrium_level","Maximum_parcel_level","Acceleration","Terminal_velocity","Kinetic_energy","Drag_(physics)","Entrainment_(meteorology)","Convective_available_potential_energy","Buoyancy","Air_parcel","Thermal_column","Thermal_low","Sea_breeze","National_Weather_Service","Hot_air_balloon","Water_vapor","Condensation","Latent_heat","Convective_available_potential_energy","Cumulonimbus","Thunderstorm","Wind_shear","Thundersnow","Convective_inhibition","Cold_front","Sea_breeze","Outflow_boundary","Positive_vorticity_advection","Shortwave_(meteorology)","Rossby_wave","Jet_stream","Geostrophic_wind","Mesocyclone","Jet_stream","Supercooled","Water","Condensation_nuclei","Vertical_draft","Latent_heat","Tornado","Updraft_and_Downdraft","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Virga","Microburst","Derecho","Cumulonimbus_cloud","Cumulus_cloud","Funnel_cloud","Debris","Dust","Tri-state_tornado","Skew-T_log-P_diagram","Atmospheric_sounding","Radiosonde","Atmospheric_model","Atmospheric_thermodynamics","Convective_storm_detection"]}
