{"cursor":"17691","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Axial compressors' are rotating, airfoil-based compressors in which the working\nfluid principally flows parallel to the axis of rotation. This is in contrast\nwith other rotating compressors such as centrifugal, axi-centrifugal and mixed-\nflow compressors where the air may enter axially but will have a significant\nradial component on exit.\n\n\n\nAxial flow compressors produce a continuous flow of compressed gas, and have the\nbenefits of high efficiencies and large mass flow capacity, particularly in\nrelation to their cross-section. They do, however, require several rows of\nairfoils to achieve large pressure rises making them complex and expensive\nrelative to other designs (e.g. centrifugal compressor).\n\nAxial compressors are widely used in gas turbines, such as jet engines, high\nspeed ship engines, and small scale power stations. They are also used in\nindustrial applications such as large volume air separation plants, blast\nfurnace air, fluid catalytic cracking air, and propane dehydrogenation. Axial\ncompressors, known as superchargers, have also been used to boost the power of\nautomotive reciprocating engines by compressing the intake air, though these are\nvery rare.\n","linknr":289,"url":"Axial_compressor","recorded":1362482191,"links":31,"instances":["aircraft","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Turbomachinery","Chemical engineering","Compressors","Turbines","Engineering thermodynamics","Fluid dynamics","Aerodynamics"],"headings":["Description","Working","Design","Development","Axial-flow jet engines","Design notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Axial_compressor.gif/220px-Axial_compressor.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/EJ200_inlet.jpg/220px-EJ200_inlet.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Axial-flow-compressor.png/220px-Axial-flow-compressor.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Compr.Assiale.jpg/220px-Compr.Assiale.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","physics"],["junkers","aircraft"]],"members":["junkers","stress"],"related":["Airfoil","Gas_compressor","Centrifugal_compressor","Gas_turbines","Jet_engine","Supercharger","Turbofan","Compressor_stall","Pressure_surge","Alan_Arnold_Griffith","Aerodynamic_stall","Airfoil","Metal_fatigue","Stress_(physics)","Hayne_Constant","Royal_Aircraft_Establishment","Frank_Whittle","Hans_von_Ohain","Centrifugal_compressor","Supercharger","Metropolitan-Vickers","Turboprop","Metrovick_F.2","Heinkel_He_178","Junkers_(Aircraft)","Jumo_004","BMW","BMW_003","Messerschmitt_Me_262","Arado_Ar_234","Lockheed_Corporation","General_Electric","Northrop_Corporation","US_Navy","Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation","Westinghouse_J30","Compression_ratio","Streamliner","Heat_engine","Fuel_efficiency","Compression_ratio","Compressor_stall","Sweet_spot","Rolls-Royce_Olympus","Rolls-Royce_RB.211","Turbine","Air_conditioning","General_Electric_J79","General_Electric_Aircraft_Engines","Swirl","Stagnation_temperature","Mach_number","Turbofan","Helmholtz_resonance"]}
