Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune\nresponse is termed an autoimmune disease. Autoimmunity is often caused by a\nlack of germ development of a target body and as such the immune response acts\nagainst its own cells and tissues. Prominent examples include Celiac disease,\ndiabetes mellitus type 1 (IDDM), Sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus\n(SLE), SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis,\nGraves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Addison's Disease,\nrheumatoid arthritis (RA) and allergies. Autoimmune diseases are very often\ntreated with steroids.\n\nThe misconception that an individual's immune system is totally incapable of\nrecognizing self antigens is not new. Paul Ehrlich, at the beginning of the\ntwentieth century, proposed the concept of 'horror autotoxicus', wherein a\n'normal' body does not mount an immune response against its own tissues. Thus,\nany autoimmune response was perceived to be abnormal and postulated to be\nconnected with human disease. Now, it is accepted that autoimmune responses are\nan integral part of vertebrate immune systems (sometimes termed 'natural\nautoimmunity'), normally prevented from causing disease by the phenomenon of\nimmunological tolerance to self-antigens. Autoimmunity should not be confused\nwith alloimmunity.\n","linknr":627,"url":"Autoimmune","recorded":1362500923,"links":53,"instances":["epidemiology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunology","Autoimmune diseases|"],"headings":["Low-level autoimmunity","Immunological tolerance","Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity","Genetic Factors","Sex","Environmental Factors","Pathogenesis of autoimmunity","Classification","Diagnosis","Treatments","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","biology"],["incidence","epidemiology"]],"members":["incidence","polymorphism"],"related":["Autoimmune_disease","Celiac_disease","Insulin-dependent_diabetes_mellitus","Sarcoidosis","Lupus_erythematosus","Sjögren's_syndrome","Churg-Strauss_Syndrome","Hashimoto's_thyroiditis","Graves'_disease","Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura","Addison's_Disease","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Allergies","Steroids","Paul_Ehrlich","Vertebrate_immune_systems","Immunological_tolerance","Self-antigens","Alloimmunity","Neoplastic","CD8+_T_cells","Cancer","Antigen","Pathogens","MHC_Class_II","Antibody","Drug-naïve","CD4+_T_cells","Antigen","Cytochrome_C","Zap-70","Phosphorylation","Interleukin-2","Noel_Rose","Ernst_Witebsky","Ivan_Roitt","Deborah_Doniach","University_College_London","Immunological_tolerance","Frank_Macfarlane_Burnet","Gustav_Nossal","Niels_K._Jerne","Lymphohistiocytosis","Pancytopenia","Lymphadenopathy","Hepatosplenomegaly","Immunoglobulins","T-cell_receptors","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Lymphocyte","Systemic_Lupus_Erythematosus","Narcolepsy","Multiple_sclerosis","Sjögren's_syndrome","Myasthenia_gravis","Lupus_erythematosus","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Diabetes_mellitus","Pemphigus_vulgaris","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Polymorphism_(biology)","Lupus_erythematosus","PTPN22","Incidence_(epidemiology)","Hashimoto's_thyroiditis","Graves'_disease","Multiple_sclerosis","Myasthenia_gravis","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis","Sex","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Type_1_diabetes_mellitus","Wegener's_granulomatosis","Crohn's_disease","Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis","Psoriasis","Sex_steroids","X-inactivations","X-inactivation","Hygiene_hypothesis","Coxsackie_B","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Super-antigens","Polyclonal_antibodies","B-lymphocytes","Drug-induced_lupus_erythematosus","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Citrullination","Antibodies","Peptides","B-cells","T-cells","Super-antigens","Antigen","Rheumatic_Fever","Streptococci","Idiotypes","Epitopes","Cytokines","TGF-β","Dendritic_cell","Antigen","Lymphocytes","Lymphocyte","Immune_reaction","Epitope","Regulatory_T_cells","Natural_Killer_T_cell","Γδ_T-cells","Lupus_erythematosus","Sjögren's_syndrome","Scleroderma","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Dermatomyositis","Polymyositis","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Hashimoto's_thyroiditis","Addison's_disease","Coeliac_disease","Crohn's_Disease","Pernicious_anaemia","Pemphigus_vulgaris","Vitiligo","Autoimmune_haemolytic_anaemia","Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura","Myasthenia_gravis","C-reactive_protein","Autoantibodies","Immunofluorescence","Immunosuppression","Anti-inflammatory","Palliative","Immunomodulator","Etanercept","Rituximab","Tocilizumab","Abatacept","Helminthic_therapy","Nematodes","Hookworm","T_cell_vaccination","Autoimmune_disease","Protective_autoimmunity","Psychoneuroimmunology","Systemic_autoimmune_disease"]}
