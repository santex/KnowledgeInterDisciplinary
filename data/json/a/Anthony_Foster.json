{"cursor":"3750","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Anthony Foster' (1705 â April 1779), of Collon, Co Louth, was an Irish\npolitician and judge.\n\nHe was the son of John Foster of Dunleer and Elizabeth Fortesque. He was Chief\nBaron of the Irish Exchequer 1766-1777. Prior to appointment to the Bench he\nrepresented Dunleer in the Irish House of Commons from 1738 to 1761 and\nsubsequently Louth from 1761 to 1767. Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in\nIreland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 p.213\n\nHe attended the school in Dublin run by Thomas Sheridan, the friend of Jonathan\nSwift and grandfather of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Ball\np.214 He matriculated from the University of Dublin in 1722 and took his\ndegree of Bachelor of Arts in 1726. He entered Middle Temple in 1726 and was\ncalled to the Irish Bar in 1732. He became King's\nCounsel in 1760 and acted as counsel to the Board of Revenue; unlike many of his\njudicial colleagues he was never a Law Officer or Serjeant-at-law.\n\nAs a member of Parliament he worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the\nmanufacturers of Irish linen ; Ball p.161 there is\nno reason to doubt his belief in the cause, although Ball rather cynically notes\nthat it brought him rich rewards, including a gold box. As an orator ( a much\n-prized skill among public figures then ) he was badly thought of, being\ndescribed as \"slow. sleepy and charmless\".\n\nHe married firstly Elizabeth Burgh, daughter of William Burgh, in 1736; she died in 1744. They had three children:\n* John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel.\n* William Foster, successively Bishop of Cork and Ross, Bishop of Kilmore and\n  Bishop of Clogher.\n* Margaret Foster who married Henry Maxwell, successively Dean of Kilmore,\n  Bishop of Dromore and Bishop of Meath. He married secondly Elizabeth's cousin\n  Dorothea Burgh, daughter of Thomas de Burgh in 1749.
