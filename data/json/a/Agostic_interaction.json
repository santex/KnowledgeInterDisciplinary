{"cursor":"6403","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Agostic interaction' is a term in organometallic chemistry for the interaction\nof a coordinatively-unsaturated transition metal with a C-H bond, when the two\nelectrons involved in the C-H bond enter the empty d-orbital of a transition\nmetal, resulting in a three-center two-electron bond. Many catalytic\ntransformations, e.g. oxidative addition and reductive elimination, are proposed\nto proceed via intermediates featuring agostic interactions. Agostic\ninteractions are observed throughout organometallic chemistry in alkyl,\nalkylidene, and polyenyl ligands.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Agostic_interaction","recorded":1362665093,"links":19,"instances":["chemist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organometallic chemistry","Chemical bonding"],"headings":["History","Characteristics of agostic bonds","Related bonding interactions","Function","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/AgostKubas.png/200px-AgostKubas.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["malcolm_green","chemist"]],"members":["malcolm_green"],"related":["Organometallic_chemistry","Transition_metal","Carbon-hydrogen_bonds","Three-center_two-electron_bond","Oxidative_addition","Reductive_elimination","Maurice_Brookhart","Malcolm_Green_(chemist)","Carbon-hydrogen_bond","Triphenylphosphine","Ruthenium","Borohydride","Three-center_two-electron_bond","Trimethylaluminium","Crystallography","Neutron_diffraction","NMR","Hydride","Computational_chemistry","Hydrogen_bond","Ziegler-Natta_catalysis","Silane","Migratory_insertion"]}
