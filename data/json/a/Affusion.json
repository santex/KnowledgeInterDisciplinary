Christian\ndenominations that baptize by affusion do not deny the legitimacy of baptizing\nby immersion or aspersion; rather, they consider that affusion is a sufficient,\nif not preferable, method of baptism.\n\nAffusion and aspersion tend to be practiced by Christian denominations that also\npractice infant baptism. This may be due to the practical difficulties of\ntotally immersing an infant underwater. However, Eastern Orthodox and some Roman\nCatholics practice infant immersion. Amish, Old Order Mennonites, and\nConservative Mennonites still practice baptism by pouring.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Affusion","recorded":1362372188,"links":14,"instances":["christianity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Baptism","Water and religion","Christian terms"],"headings":["History of affusion","Affusion and the Bible","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Child_baptism_with_water.jpg/266px-Child_baptism_with_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/P_christianity.svg/31px-P_christianity.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["disciple","christianity"]],"members":["disciple"],"related":["Latin","Baptism","Submersion_baptism","Immersion_baptism","Aspersion","Aspersion","Christian_denomination","Infant_baptism","Eastern_Orthodox","Roman_Catholic_Church","Amish","Old_Order_Mennonites","Conservative_Mennonites","Didache","Holy_Orders","Catechumen","New_Testament","Acts_of_the_Apostles","Baptism_of_the_Holy_Spirit","Holy_Spirit","Luke_the_Evangelist","Acts_of_the_Apostles","Luke_the_Evangelist","Baptism","Pentecost","Disciple_(Christianity)","Holy_Spirit","Holy_Spirit","Holy_Spirit","Luke_the_Evangelist","Aspersion","Baptism","Believers_Baptism","Baptism_of_desire","Baptism_of_the_Holy_Spirit","Baptism_of_Jesus","Christianity","Conditional_baptism","John_the_Baptist","Infant_baptism"]}
