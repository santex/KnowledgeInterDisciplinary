{"cursor":"3335","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Acheson Gosford Irvine' (December 7, 1837 – January 8, 1916) served as\nCommissioner of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) from November 1, 1880, to\nMarch 31, 1886.\n\nIrvine was born in Lower Canada in 1837, the son of John George Irvine, a\ncaptain in the Royal Quebec volunteers. Acheson became Assistant Commissioner of\nthe North-West Mounted Police in 1876, and was promoted to commissioner in 1880.\n\nIrvine was involved with the events of the North-West Rebellion of 1885. On\nMarch 17, 1885, Irvine received a telegraph from Superintendent Leif Crozier\nthat there was trouble near Fort Carlton and reinforcements were required. On\nMarch 18, Irvine left Regina, Assiniboia, with 100 men, arriving in Prince\nAlbert, Saskatchewan, on March 25. On March 26, Irvine set out for Fort Carlton\nwith 83 police and 25 civilian volunteers. Shortly before his arrival there, a\nskirmish took place at Duck Lake, outside Batoche, between the existing NWMP\nforces, led by Crozier, and a group of MÃ©tis and Indians led by Gabriel Dumont,\nwith the NWMP coming off worst. On March 27, the day after his arrival, Irvine\nconcluded that Fort Carlton was indefensible and pulled the troops out,\nreturning to Prince Albert. The troops returned to Prince Albert unharmed, but\nFort Carlton burnt to the ground during the evacuation. Irvine was publicly\ncensured by General Middleton for not attacking Batoche.\n\nAcheson Irvine also served as a member of the executive council of the North-\nWest Territories from 1882 to 1886. Following his retirement in 1886, he became\nwarden of the Stony Mountain Penitentiary in Manitoba. He was awarded the\nImperial Service Order in 1902.\n\nIn 1945, an RCMP Commissioner-Class ship was named after him. The patrol\nvessel Irvine (originally named HMCS Noranda) had started off life as a Bangor-\nclass minesweeper in the Royal Canadian Navy. In 1962 the RCMP sold the ship,\nwhich was converted to a yacht, the Miriana; she sank at Montego Bay, Jamaica\nin May 1971.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Acheson_Irvine","recorded":1375083803,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/North-West_Mounted_Police","/wiki/Lower_Canada","/wiki/North-West_Rebellion","/wiki/Leif_Crozier","/wiki/Fort_Carlton","/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan","/wiki/Prince_Albert,_Saskatchewan","/wiki/Battle_of_Duck_Lake","/wiki/Batoche","/wiki/Gabriel_Dumont_(M%C3%A9tis_leader)","/wiki/Stony_Mountain_Penitentiary","/wiki/Imperial_Service_Order","/wiki/Minesweeper_(ship)","/wiki/Montego_Bay","/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&action=edit&section=1","http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/irvine_ag.shtml","http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004064","/wiki/James_MacLeod","/wiki/Commissioner_of_the_Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police","/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police","/wiki/Lawrence_Herchmer","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/104516998","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&oldid=523355030","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1837_births","/wiki/Category:1916_deaths","/wiki/Category:Companions_of_the_Imperial_Service_Order","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_of_the_Northwest_Territories","/wiki/Category:Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police_commissioners","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Acheson+Irvine&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Acheson+Irvine","/wiki/Acheson_Irvine","/wiki/Talk:Acheson_Irvine","#","/wiki/Acheson_Irvine","/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Acheson_Irvine","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Acheson_Irvine","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&oldid=523355030","/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4673626","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Acheson_Irvine&id=523355030","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Acheson+Irvine","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Acheson+Irvine&oldid=523355030&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Acheson_Irvine&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4673626#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheson_Irvine","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["métis_leader","ship"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1837
