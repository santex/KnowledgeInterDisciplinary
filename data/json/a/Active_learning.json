Bonwell and\nEison (1991) popularized this approach to instruction . This \"buzz word\" of the\n1980s became their 1990s report to the Association for the Study of Higher\nEducation (ASHE). In this report they discuss a variety of methodologies for\npromoting \"active learning\". They cite literature which indicates that to learn,\nstudents must do more than just listen: They must read, write, discuss, or be\nengaged in solving problems. In particular, students must engage in such higher-\norder thinking tasks as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. While there has\nbeen much enthusiasm for active learning, a variety of research studies since\nthe 1990s, has since promoted an important principle: Guidance early, and then\npractice later is suggested for the best results.
