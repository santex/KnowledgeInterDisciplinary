The atomic nucleus\ncontains a mix of positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons\n(except in the case of hydrogen-1, which is the only stable nuclide with no\nneutrons). The electrons of an atom are bound to the nucleus by the\nelectromagnetic force. Likewise, a group of atoms can remain bound to each other\nby chemical bonds based on the same force, forming a molecule. An atom\ncontaining an equal number of protons and electrons is electrically neutral,\notherwise it is positively or negatively charged and is known as an ion. An atom\nis classified according to the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus:\nthe number of protons determines the chemical element, and the number of\nneutrons determines the isotope of the element.<ref name=leigh1990/>\n\nChemical atoms, which in science now carry the simple name of \"atom,\" are\nminuscule objects with diameters of a few tenths of a nanometer and tiny\nmasses proportional to the volume implied by these dimensions. Atoms can only\nbe observed individually using special instruments such as the scanning\ntunneling microscope. Over 99.94% of an atom's mass is concentrated in the\nnucleus,<ref group=note>In the case of hydrogen-1, with a single electron and\nnucleon, the proton is <math>\\begin{smallmatrix}\\frac{1836}{1837} \\approx\n0.99946\\end{smallmatrix}</math>, or 99.946% of the total atomic mass. All\nother nuclides (isotopes of hydrogen and all other elements) have more\nnucleons than electrons, so the fraction of mass taken by the nucleus is\nsignificantly closer to 100% for all of these types of atoms, than for hydrogen-\n1.</ref> with protons and neutrons having roughly equal mass. Each element has\nat least one isotope with an unstable nucleus that can undergo radioactive\ndecay. This can result in a transmutation that changes the number of protons\nor neutrons in a nucleus.<ref name=slac_20090615/> Electrons that are bound to\natoms possess a set of stable energy levels, or orbitals, and can undergo\ntransitions between them by absorbing or emitting photons that match the\nenergy differences between the levels. The electrons determine the chemical\nproperties of an element, and strongly influence an atom's magnetic\nproperties. The principles of quantum mechanics have been successfully used to\nmodel the observed properties of the atom.\n","title":"Atom","headings":["Etymology","History","Components","Properties","Identification","Origin and current state","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["6:
