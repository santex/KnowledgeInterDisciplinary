He was\nawarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1910 for his work in\ndetermining the chemical composition of nucleic acids, the genetic substance\nof biological cells.\n\nKossel isolated and described the five organic compounds that are present in\nnucleic acid: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds\nwere later shown to be nucleobases, and are key in the formation of DNA and RNA,\nthe genetic material found in all living cells.\n\nKossel was an important influence on and collaborator with other important\nresearchers in biochemistry, including Henry Drysdale Dakin, Friedrich Miescher,\nEdwin B. Hart, and his professor and mentor, Felix Hoppe-Seyler. Kossel was\neditor of the Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological\nChemistry) from 1895 until his death.\n\nKossel also conducted important research into the composition of protein,\nand his research predicted the discovery of the polypeptide nature of the\nprotein molecule.\n\nThe Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration at the University of Rostock\nis named in his honor.\n","linknr":392,"url":"Albrecht_Kossel","recorded":1362481131,"links":54,"instances":["soil_study","biology","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1853 births","1927 deaths","German physiologists","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","Humboldt University of Berlin faculty","German Nobel laureates","People from Rostock","People from Mecklenburg-Schwerin","University of Strasbourg alumni","University of Rostock alumni","University of Marburg faculty","University of Heidelberg faculty"],"headings":["Early life and education","Early research and collaboration","Isolation and description of nucleobases","Research into the chemical composition of protein","Nobel prize","Later research and collaboration","Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie","Personal life","Legacy","Selected works","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Albrecht_Kossel_nobel.jpg/220px-Albrecht_Kossel_nobel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Kossel_grab.JPG/220px-Kossel_grab.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["biological_chemistry","journal"],["christian_archibald_herter","physician#the_christian_a._herter_lectures"],["biological_chemistry","journal"],["pedology","soil_study"]],"members":["christian_archibald_herter","pedology","cell","biological_chemistry"],"related":["Rostock","Germany","Heidelberg","Germany","University_of_Strasbourg","University_of_Rostock","Edwin_B._Hart","Nucleic_acid","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Biochemist","Genetics","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Nucleic_acid","Cell_(biology)","Organic_compounds","Nucleic_acid","Adenine","Cytosine","Guanine","Thymine","Uracil","Nucleobases","DNA","RNA","Henry_Drysdale_Dakin","Friedrich_Miescher","Edwin_B._Hart","Felix_Hoppe-Seyler","Biological_Chemistry_(journal)","Protein","Polypeptide","Albrecht_Kossel_Institute_for_Neuroregeneration","University_of_Rostock","Rostock","Merchant","Prussia","Consulate_general","University_of_Strasbourg","Felix_Hoppe-Seyler","Anton_de_Bary","Heinrich_Wilhelm_Gottfried_von_Waldeyer-Hartz","August_Kundt","Johann_Friedrich_Wilhelm_Adolf_von_Baeyer","University_of_Rostock","Friedrich_Miescher","University_of_Berlin","Eugen_Baumann","Emil_du_Bois-Reymond","Organic_compounds","Adenine","Cytosine","Guanine","Thymine","Uracil","Nucleobases","DNA","RNA","University_of_Marburg","Protein","Peptone","Peptide","Histidine","Alpha-amino_acid","Arginine","Histidine","Lysine","Theophylline","Heidelberg_University","Polypeptide","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Cell_biology","Cell_nucleus","Nucleic_acid","Johns_Hopkins_University","Eugene_W._Hilgard","Professor_emeritus","Agricultural_chemistry","University_of_California_at_Berkeley","University_of_Chicago","New_York_Times","Henry_Drysdale_Dakin","Arginase","Arginine","Urea","Ornithine","Agmatine","Biochemistry","Edwin_B._Hart","Single-grain_experiment","Nutrition","Anemia","Goitre","Otto_Folin","Phosphocreatine","Edinburgh","University_of_Edinburgh","Professor_emeritus","Heidelberg_University","Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister","Protamines","Histones","Flavianic_acid","Biological_Chemistry_(journal)","Felix_Hoppe-Seyler","Adolf_Holtzmann","University_of_Heidelberg","German_literature","Sanskrit","Philologist","Walther_Kossel","Physicist","Theoretical_physics","University_of_Tübingen","Chemical_bond","Ionic_bond","Octet_rule","Sommerfeld–Kossel_displacement_law","Pedology_(soil_study)","Eugene_W._Hilgard","Henry_Villard","William_Lloyd_Garrison","Acute_pancreatitis","Angina_pectoris","Heidelberg","Nucleic_acid","Nucleobases","Molecular_structure_of_Nucleic_Acids","DNA","James_D._Watson","Francis_Crick","Albrecht_Kossel_Institute_for_Neuroregeneration","University_of_Rostock","Encyclopædia_Britannica","Encyclopædia_Britannica,_Inc.","Nobelprize.org","New_York_Times","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Rostock","Heidelberg","Germany"]}
