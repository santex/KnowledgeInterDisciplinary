According to the creation myth<ref name=\"womack\">, \"Creation\nmyths are symbolic stories describing how the universe and its inhabitants came\nto be. Creation myths develop through oral traditions and therefore typically\nhave multiple versions.\"</ref> of Abrahamic religions, he is the first human. In\nthe Genesis creation narratives, he was created by Yahweh-Elohim (\"Yahweh-God\",\nthe god of Israel), though the term \"adam\" can refer to both the first\nindividual person, as well as to the general creation of humankind. Christian\nchurches differ on how they view Adam's subsequent behavior (often called the\nFall of man), and to the consequences that those actions had on the rest of\nhumanity. Christian and Jewish teachings sometimes hold Adam and Eve (the first\nwoman) to a different level of responsibility for the Fall, though Islamic\nteaching holds both equally responsible. In addition, Islam holds that Adam was\neventually forgiven, while Christianity holds that redemption occurred only\nlater through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Bahá'í Faith, Islam and some\nChristian denominations consider Adam to be the first Prophet.\n",
