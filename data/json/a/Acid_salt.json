{"cursor":"2687","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Acid salt' is a term for a class of salts formed by the partial\nneutralization of diprotic or polyprotic acids. Because the parent acid is only\npartially neutralized, one or more replaceable hydrogen atoms remain. Typical\nacid salts have one or more alkali (alkaline) metal ions as well as one or more\nhydrogen atoms. Well known examples are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3),\nsodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), sodium bisulfate (NaHSO 4), monosodium\nphosphate (NaH 2PO 4), and disodium phosphate\n(Na 2HPO 4). Often acid salts are used as buffers. Most\nintroductory chemistry textbooks discuss this area, representative is Zumdahl,\nS. S. âChemistryâ Heath, 1986: Lexington, MA. ISBN 0-669--04529-2.\n\nFor example, the acid salt sodium bisulfate is the main species formed upon the\nhalf neutralization of sulfuric acid with sodium hydroxide:\n:H 2SO 4 + NaOH → NaHSO 4 +\nH 2O\n\nAcid salts compounds can act either as an acid or a base: addition of a suitably\nstrong acid will protonate anions, and addition of a suitably strong base will\nsplit off H +. The pH of a solution of an acid salt will depend on the\nrelevant equilibrium constants and the amounts of any additional base or acid. A\ncomparison between the K b and K a will indicate this: if\nK b > K a, the solution will be basic, whereas\nif K b < K a, the solution will be acidic. In\nother words you can say that an acid salt is formed when a strong acid reacts\nwith a weak base and vice versa for basic salt.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Acid_salt","recorded":1362482477,"links":18,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Salts"],"headings":["Use in food","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/SodiumBicarbonate.png/220px-SodiumBicarbonate.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt","chemistry"],["neutralization","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base","salt","neutralization"],"related":["Salt_(chemistry)","Neutralization_(chemistry)","Polyprotic_acid","Hydrogen","Alkali_metal","Sodium_bicarbonate","Sodium_hydrosulfide","Sodium_bisulfate","Monosodium_phosphate","Disodium_phosphate","Buffer_solution","Sodium_bisulfate","Sulfuric_acid","Sodium_hydroxide","Base_(chemistry)","Protonation","Deprotonation","PH","Cream_of_tartar","Calcium_phosphate","Citrate","Aluminium","Calcium","Aluminium_phosphate","Non-dairy_creamer","Alkali_salt"]}
