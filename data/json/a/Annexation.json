{"cursor":"19872","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] 'Annexation' (Latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the permanent acquisition\nand incorporation of some territorial entity into another geo-political entity\n(either adjacent or non-contiguous). Usually, it is implied that the\nterritory and population being annexed is the smaller, more peripheral, and\nweaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size. It can also imply a\ncertain measure of coercion, expansionism or unilateralism on the part of the\nstronger of the merging entities. Because of this, more positive terms like\npolitical union or reunification are sometimes preferred. Annexation differs\nfrom cession and amalgamation, because unlike cession where territory is given\nor sold through treaty, or amalgamation (where the authorities of both sides are\nasked if they agree with the merge), annexation is a unilateral act where\nterritory is seized and held by one state and legitimized via general\nrecognition by the other international bodies (i.e. countries and\nintergovernmental organisations).\n\nDuring World War II the use of annexation deprived whole populations of the\nsafeguards provided by international laws governing military occupations. The\nauthors of the Geneva Convention IV made a point of \"giving these rules an\nabsolute character\", thus making it much more difficult for a state to bypass\ninternational law through the use of annexation.
