{"cursor":"11919","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The core idea of A.I. systems integration is making individual software\ncomponents, such as speech synthesizers, interoperable with other components,\nsuch as common sense knowledgebases, in order to create larger, broader and more\ncapable A.I. systems. The main methods that have been proposed for integration\nare message routing, or communication protocols that the software components use\nto communicate with each other, often through a middleware blackboard system.\n\nMost artificial intelligence systems involve some sort of integrated\ntechnologies, for example the integration of speech synthesis technologies with\nthat of speech recognition. However, in recent years there has been an\nincreasing discussion on the importance of systems integration as a field in its\nown right. Proponents of this approach are researchers such as Marvin Minsky,\nAaron Sloman, Deb Roy, Kristinn R. ThÃ³risson and Michael A. Arbib. A reason for\nthe recent attention A.I. integration is attracting is that there have already\nbeen created a number of (relatively) simple A.I. systems for specific problem\ndomains (such as computer vision, speech synthesis, etc.), and that integrating\nwhat's already available is a more logical approach to broader A.I. than\nbuilding monolithic systems from scratch.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Artificial_intelligence_systems_integration","recorded":1362673670,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://xenia.media.mit.edu/%7Ekris/ftp/AIMag-CDM-ThorissonEtAl04.pdf","http://www.python.org/pycon/2005/papers/4/MissionEngine.WhitePaper.pdf"],"categories":["Artificial intelligence","Software architecture"],"headings":["Why integration?","Challenges & solutions","Methodologies","Tools","Examples of Integrated Systems","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/Ai_integration.jpg/300px-Ai_integration.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/AIR-small.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Systems_integration","Software_component","Speech_synthesizer","Blackboard_system","Marvin_Minsky","Aaron_Sloman","Deb_Roy","Kristinn_R._Thórisson","Michael_A._Arbib","Computer_vision","Speech_synthesis","Software_development","W3C","Carnegie_Mellon_University","Carnegie_Mellon_University","Cyc","Cycorp","Open_Mind_Common_Sense","MIT","Free_software_movement","Constructionist_design_methodology","Augmented_reality","Kristinn_R._Thórisson","Columbia_University","Reykjavik_University","Expert_system","Blackboard_system","CORBA","Software_componentry","Programming_language","Object_Management_Group","Open_Service_Interface_Definition","O.K.I.","Specification","Service_Oriented_Architecture","Software_reusability","Interoperable","Software","ASIMO","QRIO","MIT_Cog_project","Rodney_Brooks","AIBO","TOPIO","Artificial_intelligence","Hybrid_intelligent_system","GOFAI","Computational_intelligence","Humanoid_robot","Constructionist_design_methodology","Cognitive_architecture"]}
