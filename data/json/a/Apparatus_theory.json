It\nmaintains that cinema is by nature ideological because its mechanics of\nrepresentation are ideological. Its mechanics of representation include the\ncamera and editing. The central position of the spectator within the perspective\nof the composition is also ideological.\n\nApparatus theory also argues that cinema maintains the dominant ideology of the\nculture within the viewer.
