Human anthrax vaccines\nwere developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s and in the US and UK in the\n1950s. The current FDA-approved US vaccine was formulated in the 1960s.\n\nCurrently administered human anthrax vaccines include acellular (USA, UK) and\nlive spore (Russia) varieties. All currently used anthrax vaccines show\nconsiderable local and general reactogenicity (erythema, induration, soreness,\nfever) and serious adverse reactions occur in about 1% of recipients.
