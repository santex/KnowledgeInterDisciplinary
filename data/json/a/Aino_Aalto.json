She began\nstudies in architecture that same year at the Institute of Technology, Helsinki,\nand qualified as an architect in 1920. That same year she went to work for\narchitect Oiva Kallio in Helsinki. In 1923 she moved to the city of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ to\nwork in the office of architect Gunnar A. Wahlroos, but the following year\nswitched to working in the office of architect Alvar Aalto when they got\nmarried. The Aaltos spent their honeymoon in northern Italy. It was common at\nthat time for young architects in Scandinavia to travel to Italy to study the\nvernacular architecture, and it had a profound influence on Scandinavian\narchitecture during the 1920s, including the Aaltos, flourishing in the so-\ncalled Nordic Classicism style.\n\nThe Aaltos moved their office to Turku in 1927, and started collaborating with\narchitect Erik Bryggman. The office moved again in 1933 to Helsinki. The Aaltos\ndesigned and built a joint house-office (1935â36) for themselves in Munkkiniemi,\na suburb of Helsinki, but later (1954â55) had a purpose-built office built in\nthe same neighbourhood.\n\nAino Aalto's role in the design of the architecture attributed to Alvar Aalto\nhas never been specifically verified. Their early built works were mostly small-\nscale buildings, especially summer villas, designed in the style of Nordic\nClassicism. Chief among these was the Aalto's own summer villa, Villa Flora in\nAlajÃ¤rvi from 1926 (extended 1938).\n\nIt is known that in the design work she concentrated more on the design of\ninteriors (such as the world-famous Villa Mairea in Noormarkku of 1937-39), but\nalso furniture (such as the Paimio Sanatorium of 1927-29). In 1935 the Aaltos,\ntogether with Mairea Gullichsen (chief client for the Villa Mairea) and Nils-\nGustav Hahlin, founded Artek, a firm selling lighting fixtures and furniture\ndesigned by the Aaltos. In the early years of their marriage and design\npartnership Aino Aalto and her husband would enter architectural competitions\nwith their own separate entries. In the mid-1920s the Aaltos became the first\narchitects in Finland to adopt the purified Functionalist style of architecture\ncoming from central Europe. In Aino Aalto's own individual work this comes out\nin her entry for the Finnish pavilion for the 1939 New York World's Fair, the\nfirst prize for which, however, was won by Alvar Aalto.\n\nAino Aalto also designed several glassware objects for the Finnish company\nIittala, who made household objects. Her most famous glass design is still on\nsale, and slightly different copies made by companies such as IKEA are\nwidespread. She also collaborated with her husband on the design of the\ncelebrated Savoy Vase in 1936.\n\nIn 2004 an exhibition and book (edited by Ulla Kinnunen) was arranged at the\nAlvar Aalto Museum, JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤, Finland, featuring the life's work of Aino Aalto.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Aino_Aalto","recorded":1375070302,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Aaltoarchitects.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Aaltoarchitects.jpg","/wiki/Alvar_Aalto","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/Helsinki","/wiki/Helsinki_University_of_Technology","/wiki/Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4","/wiki/Alvar_Aalto","/wiki/Vernacular_architecture","/wiki/Nordic_Classicism","/wiki/Turku","/wiki/Erik_Bryggman","/wiki/Alaj%C3%A4rvi","/wiki/Villa_Mairea","/wiki/Noormarkku","/wiki/Paimio_Sanatorium","/w/index.php?title=Mairea_Gullichsen&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Artek_(company)","/wiki/Functionalism_(architecture)","/wiki/1939_New_York_World%27s_Fair","/wiki/Iittala","/wiki/IKEA","/wiki/Savoy_Vase","/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/42096370","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/Helsinki","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&oldid=547740547","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Modernist_designers","/wiki/Category:Women_architects","/wiki/Category:Finnish_architects","/wiki/Category:Finnish_designers","/wiki/Category:Finnish_interior_designers","/wiki/Category:20th-century_architects","/wiki/Category:1894_births","/wiki/Category:1949_deaths","/wiki/Category:People_from_Helsinki","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Aino+Aalto&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Aino+Aalto","/wiki/Aino_Aalto","/wiki/Talk:Aino_Aalto","#","/wiki/Aino_Aalto","/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Aino_Aalto","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Aino_Aalto","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&oldid=547740547","/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q273511","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Aino_Aalto&id=547740547","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Aino+Aalto","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Aino+Aalto&oldid=547740547&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Aino_Aalto&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//nn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q273511#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aino_Aalto","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scrip
