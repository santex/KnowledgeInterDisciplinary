The\n algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A\n yields \"yes\" (or true) (more accurately the number b in location B is greater\n than or equal to the number a in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ←\n B − A (meaning the number b − a replaces the old b). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN\n A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the\n g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style\n from Tausworthe 1977).]]\n\nIn mathematics and computer science, an 'algorithm' ( ) is a step-by-step\nprocedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data\nprocessing, and automated reasoning.\n\nAn algorithm is an effective method expressed as a list<ref>\"Any classical\nmathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of\nEnglish words\" (Rogers 1987:2).</ref> of well-defined instructions<ref>Well\ndefined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: \"There is a\ncomputing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry\nout the computations\" (Rogers 1987:2).</ref> for calculating a function.<ref>\"an\nalgorithm is a procedure for computing a function (with respect to some chosen\nnotation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in\nno loss of generality\", (Rogers 1987:1).</ref> Starting from an initial state\nand initial input (perhaps empty),<ref>\"An algorithm has zero or more inputs,\ni.e., quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins\"\n(Knuth 1973:5).</ref> the instructions describe a computation that, when\nexecuted, proceeds through a finite <ref>\"A procedure which has all the\ncharacteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be\ncalled a 'computational method'\" (Knuth 1973:5).</ref> number of well-defined\nsuccessive states, eventually producing \"output\"<ref>\"An algorithm has one or\nmore outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs\"\n(Knuth 1973:5).</ref> and terminating at a final ending state. The transition\nfrom one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms,\nknown as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.<ref>Whether or not a\nprocess with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm\nis debatable. Rogers opines that: \"a computation is carried out in a discrete\nstepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . .\ncarried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices,\ne.g., dice\" Rogers 1987:2.</ref>\n\nThough al-Khwārizmī's algorism referred to the rules of performing arithmetic\nusing Hindu-Arabic numerals and the systematic solution of linear and quadratic\nequations, a partial formalization of what would become the modern algorithm\nbegan with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the \"decision problem\")\nposed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as\nattempts to define \"effective calculability\"<ref>Kleene 1943 in Davis\n1965:274</ref> or \"effective method\";<ref>Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225</ref>\nthose formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of\n1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's\n\"Formulation 1\" of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–7 and 1939.\nGiving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion,\nremains a challenging problem.<ref></ref>\n","title":"algorithm","headings":["Informal definition","Formalization","Implementation","Computer algorithms","Examples","Algorithmic analysis","Classification","Continuous
