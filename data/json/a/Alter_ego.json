A person who has an\nalter ego is said to lead a double life. The term appeared in common usage in\nthe early 19th century when dissociative identity disorder was first described\nby psychologists. Cicero was the first to coin the term as part of\nhis philosophical construct in 1st century Rome, but he described it as \"a\nsecond self, a trusted friend\". {{cite web |url =\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alter+ego |title = Alter Ego |last =\n|first = |year = 2009 |work = Collins English Dictionary - Complete and\nUnabridged 10th Edition |publisher = William Collins Sons & Co.

It's also used to design the 'best friend' of another\ncharacter in a story. Similarly, the term alter ego may be applied to the role\nor persona taken on by an actor or by other types of performers.\n\nThe existence of \"another self\" was first recognized in the 1730s. Anton Mesmer\nused hypnosis to separate the alter ego. These experiments showed a behavior\npattern that was distinct from the personality of the individual when he was in\nthe waking state compared to when he was under hypnosis. Another character had\ndeveloped in the altered state of consciousness but in the same body.\n\nAlter ego is also used to refer to the different behaviors any person may\ndisplay in certain situations. Related concepts include avatar, doppelgÃ¤nger,\nimpersonator, and split personality.\n","linknr":318,"url":"Alter_ego","recorded":1362668718,"links":54,"instances":["character","arts","psychology","breaking_bad","band","2012_film","comics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Alter egos|","Self","Literary concepts","Latin words and phrases","Superhero fiction"],"headings":["''Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde''","Comic book usage","Performing arts usage","In film","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1a/Superman_296.jpg/200px-Superman_296.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["self","psychology"],["character","arts"],["the_man_of_steel","comics"],["kiss","band"],["last_friday_night","t.g.i.f."],["brüno","character"],["the_dictator","2012_film"],["walter_white","breaking_bad"]],"members":["brüno","character","last_friday_night","self","walter_white","kiss","the_dictator","the_man_of_steel"],"related":["Latin_language","Self_(psychology)","Personality_psychology","Dissociative_identity_disorder","Cicero","Ancient_Rome","Literary_criticism","Character_(arts)","Psychology","Anton_Mesmer","Hypnosis","Behavior_pattern","Waking_state","Consciousness","Avatar","Doppelgänger","Impersonator","Split_personality","Robert_Louis_Stevenson","Psychopathy","Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths","Comic_books","Archetype","Superman","Clark_Kent","Batman","Bruce_Wayne","The_Man_of_Steel_(comics)","The_Incredible_Hulk","Bruce_Banner","The_Beatles","Sgt._Pepper's_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band","Glam_rock","David_Bowie","The_Thin_White_Duke","KISS_(band)","Horror_fiction","Shock_rock","Alice_Cooper","Marilyn_Manson","Jay_Sean","Contemporary_R&B","Rapping","Rap_battle","Eminem","Lil_Wayne","Traphik","B.o.B","Kool_Keith","The_Notorious_B.I.G.","Tech_N9ne","T.I.","Christina_Aguilera","My_Chemical_Romance","Beyoncé_Knowles","Katy_Perry","Last_Friday_Night_(T.G.I.F.)","Tyler,_The_Creator","Marx_Brothers","Vaudeville","Groucho_Marx","Standup_comedy","Don_Rickles","Jackie_Mason","Shtick","Andy_Kaufman","Latka_Gravas","Tony_Clifton","Elvis_Presley","Sacha_Baron_Cohen","Ali_G","Borat_Sagdiyev","Brüno_(character)","The_Dictator_(2012_film)","Professional_wrestling","Hulk_Hogan","The_Undertaker","Triple_H","The_Miz","CM_Punk","Milwaukee_Brewers","Center_fielder","Nyjer_Morgan","Beyoncé_Knowles","Korn","Jonathon_Davis","George_McFarland","Flashlight","Michael_Cera","Ichigo_Kurosaki","Hollow_Ichigo","Natalie_Portman","Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad)","François_Truffaut","Pen_name","Persona","Ring_name","Stage_name","True_self_and_false_self"]}
