Albert & Son Pty Ltd\n| founded = 1964 founder = Ted Albert distributor = genre = Various country =\n| Australia location = Sydney url =\n}}\n\n'Albert Productions', a division of music publishing and recording company\nAlbert Music, is one of Australia's longest established independent record\nlabels to specialise in rock and roll music. The label was founded in 1964 by\nTed Albert, whose family owned and operated the Australian music publishing\nhouse J. Albert & Son.\n\nDuring the 1960s Albert Productions operated like other similar companies, such\nas those founded by producers Joe Meek, Phil Spector or Shel Talmy. Typically,\nthese companies discovered and signed new pop performers and groups, produced\ntheir recordings independently, then leased the finished product to established\nrecord labels, who handled their release, distribution and promotion.\n\nTed Albert signed two of the most important Australian groups of the mid-1960s,\nBilly Thorpe & The Aztecs and The Easybeats. Their recordings were released\nthrough a deal with EMI's subsidiary label Parlophone and included some of the\nbiggest Australian hits of the decade, most of which were produced by Albert\nhimself and Shel Talmy.\n\nThe company curtailed its recording activities in the late 1960s but was\nrevived in the early 1970s, when Albert Productions established its own record\nlabel and a state-of-the-art recording studio in central Sydney. Early Alberts\nacts included Alison MacCallum, Ted Mulry, John Paul Young and Bobbi Marchini,\nand many of their recordings were produced by visiting British pop svengali\nSimon Napier-Bell. But the label's greatest success came in the mid-1970s,\nfollowing the return to Australia of former The Easybeats' members, Harry Vanda\nand George Young.\n\nIn the last years of The Easybeats the duo had become both a powerful\nsongwriting team and highly skilled producers, and upon returning to Australia\nin early 1973 they became inhouse producers for Albert Productions, which\nquickly became one of the most successful labels in Australian music. Usually\nworking in collaboration with engineer Bruce Brown, Vanda & Young produced (and\noften also co-wrote) a string of successful singles and albums for acts\nincluding former band mate Stevie Wright, John Paul Young, AC/DC (containing two\nof Young's brothers), The Angels, Cheetah and William Shakespeare.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s Vanda & Young also enjoyed their own\nsuccessful career as Alberts recording artists, releasing a string of highly\nregarded albums and singles under the ironic pseudonym Flash and the Pan. These\nincluded the Australian hits \"Down Among the Dead Men\" and \"Hey St Peter\" and\n\"Walking in the Rain\", which was later covered by Grace Jones.\n\nThe Albert Productions label is known internationally through its association\nwith hard rock band AC/DC. Vanda & Young produced all their albums recorded in\nAustralia between 1974 and 1977, and two mainstay members of the band, Malcolm\nand Angus Young, were George's younger brothers. In 2003 Albert Productions\nestablished operations in the United Kingdom and then added the Northern Ireland\nrock band The Answer to its recording artist stable.\n\nAlbert Records does not only specialise in Rock & Roll music. Australian R&B\nsinger, Paulini signed to Albert Records in 2009.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Albert_Productions","recorded":1374521521,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Albertlogo.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Albertlogo.JPG","/wiki/Albert_Music","/wiki/Ted_Albert","/wiki/Australia","/wiki/Sydney","http://www.albertmusic.com/","/wiki/Albert_Music","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/1964_in_music","/wiki/Edward_%27Ted%27_Albert","/wiki/Albert_Music","/wiki/Joe_Meek","/wiki/Phil_Spector","/wiki/Shel_Talmy","/wiki/Billy_Thorpe_%26_The_Aztecs","/wiki/The_Easybeats","/wiki/Parlophone","/wiki/Alison_MacCallum","/wiki/Ted_Mulry","/wiki/John_Paul_Young","/w/index.php?title=Bobbi_Marchini&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Simon_Napier-Bell","/wiki/Harry_Vanda","/wiki/George_Young_(rock_musician)","/wiki/Vanda_%26_Young","/wiki/Stevie_Wright_(Australian_singer)","/wiki/John_Paul_Young","/wiki/AC/DC","/wiki/The_Angels_(Australian_band)","/wiki/Cheetah_(band)","/wiki/William_Shakespeare_(singer)","/wiki/Flash_and_the_Pan","/wiki/Grace_Jones","/wiki/The_Answer_(band)","/wiki/R%26B","/wiki/Paulini","#Featured_Artists","#Furthur_reading","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/AC/DC","/wiki/Paulini","/wiki/Megan_Washington","/wiki/Minus_The_Bear","/wiki/The_Seabellies","/wiki/The_Basics","/w/index.php?title=Shelley_Harland&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Eulogies_(band)","/wiki/Bad_Veins","/wiki/The_Dears","/wiki/Darker_My_Love","/wiki/Sea_Wolf_(band)","/wiki/Billy_Thorpe_%26_The_Aztecs","/wiki/Breed_77","/wiki/Dallas_Crane","/wiki/George_Young_(rock_musician)","/w/index.php?title=Graham_Lowndes&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Happylife&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Harry_Vanda","/wiki/Aleesha_Rome","/wiki/John_Paul_Young","/wiki/Oblivia_(band)","/wiki/Skybombers","/wiki/Stevie_Wright_(Australian_singer)","/wiki/The_Choirboys_(band)","/wiki/The_Answer_(band)","/wiki/The_Easybeats","/wiki/The_Marcus_Hook_Roll_Band","/wiki/The_Missing_Links","/w/index.php?title=The_Throb&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/The_Angels_(Australian_band)","/wiki/San_Cisco","/w/index.php?title=William_Shakespeare_(John_Cave)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0727019090","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0330363778","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1740512618","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0869142933","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780732289355","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781742232171","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/List_of_record_labels","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit&section=4","http://www.milesago.com/industry/alberts.htm","http://www.amo.org.au/label.asp?id=18","http://www.crabsodyinblue.com/acdcalberts.htm","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit&section=5","http://www.albertmusic.com/news/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&oldid=541084883","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Record_labels_established_in_1964","/wiki/Category:Re-established_companies","/wiki/Category:Australian_independent_record_labels","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Albert+Productions&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Albert+Productions","/wiki/Albert_Productions","/wiki/Talk:Albert_Productions","#","/wiki/Albert_Productions","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Albert_Productions&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLi
