{"cursor":"7068","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin' (2 February 1807, Paris – 31 December\n1874) was a French politician.\n\nThe grandson of Nicolas Philippe Ledru, the celebrated quack doctor known as\n\"Comus\" under Louis XV and Louis XVI, Ledru-Rollin was born in Paris. [http://www.dr-belair.com/dic/Politics/Biographies/Ledru-\nRollin.htm Biographie de Alexandre Ledru-Rollin] He had just begun to\npractise at the Parisian bar before the Revolution of July 1830 and was retained\nfor the Republican defence in most of the great political trials of the next ten\nyears. In 1838, he bought for 330,000 francs DÃ©sirÃ© Dalloz's place in the Court\nof Cassation. He was elected deputy for Le Mans in 1841 with little opposition;\nbut the violence of his electoral speeches led to his being tried at Angers and\nsentenced to four months' imprisonment and a fine, against which he appealed\nsuccessfully on a technical point.\n\nHe made a rich and romantic marriage in 1843 and, in 1846, disposed of his\ncharge at the Court of Cassation to give his time entirely to politics. He was\nnow the recognized leader of the working-men of France. He had more authority in\nthe country than in the Chamber, where the violence of his oratory diminished\nits effect. He asserted that the fortifications of Paris were directed against\nliberty, not against foreign invasion, and he stigmatized the law of regency\n(1842) as an audacious usurpation.\n\nNeither from official liberalism nor from the press did he receive support; even\nthe republican National was opposed to him because of his championship of\nlabour. He therefore founded La RÃ©forme, in which to advance his propaganda.\nBetween Ledru-Rollin and Odilon Barrot with the other chiefs of the \"dynastic\nLeft\" there were acute differences, hardly dissimulated even during the\ntemporary alliance which produced the campaign of the banquets.\n\nIt was the speeches of Ledru-Rollin and Louis Blanc at working-men's banquets in\nLille, Dijon and Chalons that really heralded the revolution. Ledru-Rollin\nprevented the appointment of the duchess of Orleans as regent in 1848. He and\nAlphonse de Lamartine held the tribune in the Chamber of Deputies until the\nParisian populace stopped serious discussion by invading the Chamber. He was\nminister of the interior in the provisional government, and was also a member of\nthe executive committee appointed by the Constituent Assembly, from which Louis\nBlanc and the extremists were excluded. At the crisis of 15 May, he definitively\nsided with Lamartine and the party of order against the proletariat.\n\nHenceforward his position was a difficult one. He never regained his influence\nwith the working classes, who considered they had been betrayed; but to his\nshort ministry belongs the credit of the establishment of a working system of\nuniversal suffrage. At the presidential election in December he was put forward\nas the Socialist candidate, but secured only 370,000 votes. Ledru-Rollin led The\nMountain, a moderate republican grouping, to the 1849 legislative election, and\nsecured 25% of the vote. His opposition to the policy of President Louis\nNapoleon, especially his Roman policy, led to his moving the impeachment of the\npresident and his ministers. The motion was defeated, and next day (13 June\n1849) he headed what he called a peaceful demonstration, and his enemies armed\ninsurrection.\n\nLedru-Rollin himself escaped to London where he joined the executive of the\nrevolutionary committee of Europe, with Lajos Kossuth and Giuseppe Mazzini among\nhis colleagues. He was accused of complicity in an obscure attempt (1857)\nagainst the life of Napoleon III of France, and condemned in his absence to\ndeportation. Ãmile Ollivier removed the exceptions from the general amnesty in\n1870, and Ledru-Rollin returned to France after twenty years of exile. Though\nelected in 1871 in three departments he refused to sit in the National Assembly,\nand took no serious part in politics until 1874 when he was returned to the\nAssembly as member for Vaucluse.\n\nUnder Louis Philippe he made large contributions to French jurisprudence,\nediting the Journal du palais, 1791â1837 (27 you., 1837) and 1837â1847 (17\nvols.), with a commentary Repertoire gÃ©nÃ©ral de la jurisprudence franÃ§aise (8\nvols., 1843â1848), the introduction to which was written by himself. His later\nwritings were political in character. See Ledru-Rollin, ses discours et ses\nÃ©crits politiques (2 vols., Paris, 1879), edited by his widow.\n\nLedru-Rollin died in Fontenay-aux-Roses.\n\nThere is currently an avenue as well as a Paris MÃ©tro station named Ledru-\nRollin.\n","linknr":158,"url":"Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin","recorded":1375082275,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Alexandre_Ledru-Rollin.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Alexandre_Ledru-Rollin.jpg/220px-Alexandre_Ledru-Rollin.jpg","/wiki/File:Alexandre_Ledru-Rollin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/France","/wiki/Politician","/wiki/Comus_(Nicolas_Philippe_Ledru)","/wiki/Louis_XV_of_France","/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France","/wiki/Paris","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Paris","/wiki/Revolution_of_July_1830","/wiki/D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Dalloz","/wiki/Le_Mans","/wiki/Angers","/wiki/Liberalism","/wiki/Odilon_Barrot","/wiki/Louis_Blanc","/wiki/Lille","/wiki/Dijon","/wiki/Chalon-sur-Sa%C3%B4ne","/wiki/Alphonse_de_Lamartine","/wiki/Louis_Blanc","/wiki/French_demonstration_of_15_May_1848","/wiki/Proletariat","/wiki/French_presidential_election,_1848","/wiki/Socialist","/wiki/The_Mountain_(1849)","/wiki/French_legislative_election,_1849","/wiki/Louis_Napoleon","/wiki/London","/wiki/Lajos_Kossuth","/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini","/wiki/Napoleon_III_of_France","/wiki/%C3%89mile_Ollivier","/wiki/Vaucluse","/wiki/Louis-Philippe_of_France","/wiki/Fontenay-aux-Roses","/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro","/wiki/Ledru-Rollin_(Paris_M%C3%A9tro)","/w/index.php?title=Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.dr-belair.com/dic/Politics/Biographies/Ledru-Rollin.htm","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/File:Wikisource-logo.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Ledru-Rollin,_Alexandre_Auguste","/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition","/wiki/Jacques-Charles_Dupont_de_l%27Eure","/wiki/French_Head_of_State","/wiki/French_Executive_Commission_(1848)","/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Arago","/wiki/Louis-Antoine_Garnier-Pag%C3%A8s","/wiki/Alphonse_de_Lamartine","/wiki/Pierre_Marie_(de_Saint-Georges)","/wiki/Louis-Eug%C3%A8ne_Cavaignac","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Alexandre_Ledru-Rollin","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/71488878","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Paris","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin&oldid=540531928","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1807_births","/wiki/Category:1874_deaths","/wiki/Category:Politicians_from_Paris","/wiki/Category:The_Mountain_(1849)_politicians","/wiki/Category:Heads_of_state_of_France","/wiki/Category:French_interior_ministers","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Chamber_of_Deputies_of_the_July_Monarchy","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_1848_Constituent_Assembly","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_National_Legislative_Assembly_of_the_French_Second_Republic","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_National_Assembly_(1871)","/wiki/Category:French_people_of_the_Revolutions_of_1848","/wiki/Category:Forty-Eighters","/wiki/Category:Burials_at_P%C3%A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_a_citation_from_the_1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_with_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:Commons_category_with_local_link_different_than_on_Wikidata","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alexandre+Auguste+Ledru-Rollin&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alexandre+Auguste+Ledru-Rollin","/wiki/Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin","/wiki/Talk:Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin","#","/wiki/Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin","/w/index.php?title=Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alexandre_Auguste_Ledru-Rollin&action=history","#"
