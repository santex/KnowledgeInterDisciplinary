Action can be referred to a pianos or\nother musical keyboards, including stage pianos and synthesizer. The key action\nmechanism determines 'weighted keys' feeling, Katie Hafner (2009)\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=Dig5pUHMjIsC&pg=PT52 A Romance on Three Legs:\nGlenn Gould's Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Piano] p.52 quote:\nMatthay (1963) p.91 quote: {{quotation|'Delicacy of the action'.\nResponsiveness of the instrument's \" touch.\" The key should slip down \" clean \"\nâ with the least possible amount of friction. This does not imply that the key\nmay not be considerably weighted. Friction is impedimental, but weight is not. A\ncertain amount of weight is indeed desirable, as this permits the \" Resting\" at\nsurface-level of the key to be more robust ; thus not only enhancing one's sense\nof security, but also tempting one toward correct key-treatment, since key-\ntapping is more easily discerned to be futile in the case of the more heavily-\nweighted key.\n\nHeaviness of this kind must, moreover, not be confused with \" stickiness\" during\ndescent â stickiness is a sure sign of a badly constructed mechanism, or of one\nin bad condition. A sufficiently weighted key is also quite a distinct thing\nfrom a heavily-felted, or deeply \"toued\" hammer--a hammer softened by\npricking.\n\nDifficulty of enunciation is caused in the latter case, and the term \" heaviness\nof touch \" is here often misapplied.}} that is the feeling of the\nheaviness of the touch of the keys.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Action_(piano)","recorded":1362677184,"links":20,"instances":["nautical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Piano"],"headings":["History","Modern upright action","Modern grand action","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Piano_action_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_17571.jpg/425px-Piano_action_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_17571.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Wood_%26_Brooks_piano_action.jpg/220px-Wood_%26_Brooks_piano_action.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Fortepian_-_mechanizm_angielski.svg/400px-Fortepian_-_mechanizm_angielski.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["capstan","nautical"]],"members":["capstan"],"related":["Piano","Musical_keyboard","Mechanical_assembly","Musical_keyboard","Stage_piano","Synthesizer","Bartolomeo_Cristofori","Harpsichord","Gottfried_Silbermann","Johann_Andreas_Stein","Americus_Backers","Leather","Mortise","Lead","Grand_piano","Gravity","Capstan_(nautical)","Buckle","Project_Gutenberg"]}
