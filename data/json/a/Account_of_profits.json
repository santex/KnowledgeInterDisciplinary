{"cursor":"2598","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'account of profits' (sometimes referred to as an 'accounting for profits' or\nsimply an 'accounting') is a type of equitable remedy most commonly used in\ncases of breach of fiduciary duty. Black's Law Dictionary, 7th ed.\n1999 It is an action taken against a defendant to recover the profits\ntaken as a result of the breach of duty, in order to prevent unjust enrichment.\n\nIn conducting an account of profits, the plaintiff is treated as if they were\nconducting the business of the defendant, and made those profits which were\nattributable to the defendant's wrongful actions. This can be rather complex in\npractice, because the defendant's accounting records must be examined (sometimes\nby a forensic accountant) to determine what portion of his gross profits were\nderived to the wrongful act in\nquestion. [http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=44776 Leigh Ellis,\nTheory into Action: Calculating Damages Payments and Accounts of Profits in\nPatent Cases]\n\nHistorically an account was not an equitable remedy, but was an action at common\nlaw, and is therefore technically an instrument of law, though it arose at a\ntime before the distinction between law and equity was marked. National\nTrust Co. v. H & R Block Canada Inc., 2003 SCC 66.\n\nCo-owners in concurrent estates also have the right to an accounting of profits,\nin order to properly apportion income from the use or leasing of the property.\n\nCase law has shown roughly two approaches to assessing the extent of an account\nof profits: Hospital Products Ltd. v United States Surgical\nCorporation\n# To account not of the entire business but of the particular benefits which\n# flowed to him in breach of his duty; To account for the entire business and\n# its profits, due allowance being made for the time, energy, skill and\n# financial contribution of the fiduciary (the approach in [[Boardman v\n# Phipps]])\n","linknr":130,"url":"Account_of_profits","recorded":1363836031,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Legal_remedy","/wiki/Damages","/wiki/Damages#Compensatory_or_expectation_damages","/wiki/Punitive_damages","/wiki/Incidental_damages","/wiki/Consequential_damages","/wiki/Liquidated_damages","/wiki/Reliance_damages","/wiki/Damages#Nominal_damages","/wiki/Statutory_damages","/wiki/Treble_damages","/wiki/Equitable_remedy","/wiki/Specific_performance","/wiki/Constructive_trust","/wiki/Injunction","/wiki/Restitution","/wiki/Rescission","/wiki/Rectification_(law)","/wiki/Declaratory_judgment","/wiki/Adequate_remedy","/wiki/Election_of_remedies","/wiki/Provisional_remedy","/wiki/Tracing_(law)","/wiki/Legal_costs","/wiki/Template:Judicial_remedies","/wiki/Template_talk:Judicial_remedies","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Judicial_remedies&action=edit","/wiki/Equitable_remedy","/wiki/Fiduciary","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Defendant","/wiki/Profit_(accounting)","/wiki/Unjust_enrichment","/wiki/Accounting_records","/wiki/Forensic_accountant","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Concurrent_estate","/wiki/Leasing","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Boardman_v_Phipps","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Tracing_(law)","/wiki/Constructive_trust","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Black%27s_Law_Dictionary","#cite_ref-2","http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=44776","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=edit&section=3","http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Theory+Into+Action+-+Calculating+Damages+Payments+And+Accounts+Of...-a0155672840","/wiki/Patent_infringement_under_United_Kingdom_law","/wiki/File:Scale_of_justice_2.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Law-term-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Law-term-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Law-term-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&oldid=536869910","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Judicial_remedies","/wiki/Category:Equity_(law)","/wiki/Category:Legal_term_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Account+of+profits&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Account+of+profits","/wiki/Account_of_profits","/wiki/Talk:Account_of_profits","#","/wiki/Account_of_profits","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Account_of_profits","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Account_of_profits","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&oldid=536869910","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Account_of_profits&id=536869910","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Account+of+profits","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Account+of+profits&oldid=536869910&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Account_of_profits&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy"
