Agronomy encompasses work in the areas of plant\ngenetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. Agronomy is the\napplication of a combination of sciences like biology, chemistry, economics,\necology, earth science, and genetics. Agronomists today are involved with many\nissues including producing food, creating healthier food, managing environmental\nimpact of agriculture, and creating energy from\nplants.
