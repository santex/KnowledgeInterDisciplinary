{"cursor":"19241","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'actor' (alternatively 'actress' for a female; see terminology) is a person\nwho acts in a dramatic or comic production and works in film, television,\ntheatre, or radio in that capacity.  The ancient Greek word for an\n\"actor,\" (hypokrites), means literally \"one who interprets\"; Hypokrites (related to our word for hypocrite) also means, less\noften, \"to answer\" the tragic chorus. See Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and\nSlater, who offer translations of classical source material that utilises the\nterm hypocrisis (acting) (1994, 257, 265â267). in this sense, an actor is\none who interprets a dramatic character. This is true\nwhether the character than an actor plays is based on a real person or a\nfictional one, even themselves (when the actor is 'playing themselves,' as in\nsome forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly, as in John\nMalkovich's performance in the film [[Being John Malkovich]]); to act is to\ncreate a character in performance: \"The dramatic world can be extended to\ninclude the 'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain\n'possible' surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such\" (Elam 1980,\n110).\n","linknr":439,"url":"Actor","recorded":1362669900,"links":111,"instances":["saturday_night_live","new_york","arts","theatre","2007_film","storytelling","performing_arts","actor","actor","theatre"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acting","Actors|","Entertainment occupations","Television terminology","Theatrical professions"],"headings":["Terminology","History","Techniques","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Jim_Brochu_and_Steve_Schalchlin_-_The_Big_Voice_God_or_Merman.jpg/220px-Jim_Brochu_and_Steve_Schalchlin_-_The_Big_Voice_God_or_Merman.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","arts"],["play","theatre"],["perspective","storytelling"],["group_theatre","new_york"],["realism","theatre"],["pat","saturday_night_live"],["divine","actor"],["hairspray","1988_film"],["hairspray","musical"],["hairspray","2007_film"],["casting","performing_arts"],["extra","actor"]],"members":["pat","group_theatre","character","play","hairspray","perspective","casting","divine","extra","realism"],"related":["Person","Acting","Drama","Comic","Film","Television","Theatre","Radio_programming","Classical_Greece","Hypocrisy","Tragedy","Greek_chorus","Acting","Character_(arts)","Performance_art","Post-war","Acting","Motion_Picture_Production_Code","Cinema_of_the_United_States","Archaism","East_West_Players","Steve_Schalchlin","Play_(theatre)","Greece","Thespis","Song","Perspective_(storytelling)","Ghost","Early_Middle_Ages","Group_Theatre_(New_York)","Stella_Adler","Sanford_Meisner","Uta_Hagen","Lee_Strasberg","Actors_Studio","Realism_(theatre)","System","Theater_in_the_United_States","Semiotics","Pun","Word_play","Middle_Ages","Venice","William_Shakespeare","Puritan","Restoration_drama","English_Restoration","Margaret_Hughes","Charles_II_of_England","OED","John_Dryden","Japan","Onnagata","Kabuki","Edo_period","Culture_of_China","Prepubescent","Peter_Pan","Principal_boy","Pantomime","Opera","Breeches_role","Mezzo-soprano","Der_Rosenkavalier","Linda_Hunt","Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress","Cate_Blanchett","Bob_Dylan","Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress","Cross-dressing","Francis_Flute","Jack_Gilford","Tony_Curtis","Jack_Lemmon","Billy_Wilder","Carry_On_films","Dustin_Hoffman","Robin_Williams","Julie_Andrews","Gwyneth_Paltrow","Pat_(Saturday_Night_Live)","Julia_Sweeney","Dave_Foley","Divine_(actor)","Hairspray_(1988_film)","Harvey_Fierstein","Hairspray_(musical)","John_Travolta","Hairspray_(2007_film)","Linda_Hunt","Felicity_Huffman","Male-to-female_transsexual","Bit_part","Body_double","Cameo_appearance","Casting_(performing_arts)","Cast_member","Celebrity","Character_actor","Child_actor","Drama_school","Dramatis_personæ","Ensemble_cast","Extra_(actor)","GOTE","Improvisational_theatre","Leading_actor","Lists_of_actors","List_of_awards_in_theatre","List_of_film_awards","Master_of_Fine_Arts","Matinee_idol","Meisner_technique","Mime","Movie_star","Movie_studio","Pornographic_actor","Practical_Aesthetics","Pre-production","Q_Score","Stunt_work","Supporting_actor","Understudy","Vaudeville","Viewpoints","Voice_Actor","Constantin_Stanislavski","Lee_Strasberg","Sanford_Meisner","Robert_Brustein","Peter_Brook","Stella_Adler","Stunt_performer"]}
