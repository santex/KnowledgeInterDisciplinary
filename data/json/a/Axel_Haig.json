{"cursor":"4422","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Axel Haig' (1835-1921) was a Swedish-born artist and illustrator. His\npaintings, illustrations and etchings, undertaken for himself and on behalf of\nmany of the foremost architects of the Victorian period made him \"the Piranesi\nof the Gothic Revival.\" Mordaunt Crook et al. 1984,\npÂ 13\n\nAxel Haig was born on 10 November 1835, on the island of Gotland in the Baltic\nSea.\" His father was a landowner and timber merchant.\" Haig was apprenticed as a shipbuilder at the government dockyard at\nKarlskrona and in 1856 went to Glasgow for a further period of training at a\nfirm of Clydeside shipbuilders.\" But his interests had turned to\narchitecture and in 1859, he undertook a new apprenticeship as a draughtsman in\nthe offices of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.\" After seven\nyears there, he launched himself as an architectural artist. The middle years of\nthe nineteenth century saw an explosion in the practice of architectural\ncompetitions. The wealth generated by the empire and The Industrial Revolution\ncreated the necessary conditions for a vast expansion in civic construction.\nCommissions for government offices, town halls, churches for private\nbenefactors, railway termini were all put out to tender and competing architects\nrequired draughtsmen to illustrate their plans. In 1866 Haig met William Burges\nwhen Burges retained him to illustrate his designs for the Royal Courts of\nJustice in The Strand. Axel Haig and the Victorian Vision of the Middle Ages\npage 16 Haig produced a series of watercolour illustrations that were \"an\nimmediate sensation.\" The competition's winner, George Edmund\nStreet is said to have remarked, \"I wouldn't mind being beaten by drawings like\nthose.\"\n\nHaig and Burges continued in partnership until the latter's death in 1881. In\nthat time they jointly produced some of the most spectacular medieval visions of\nthe Victorian Gothic Revival. Cardiff Castle, Knightshayes Court, the Church of\nChrist the Consoler at Skelton-on-Ure, St Mary's Church, Park House, the Speech\nRoom, Harrow School, Castell Coch, Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut and\nthe designs for the re-decoration of Saint Paul's Cathedral: Axel Haig and\nthe Victorian Vision of the Middle Ages page 17 as Burges designed his\nmost important commissions, so Haig drew them. \"In Haig, Burges, the architect\nof a medieval dreamland, had found an artist worthy of his dreams.\"\n\nHaig developed a second career as an etcher and his drawings and lithographs of\nEuropean castles, palaces, landscapes and cathedrals became hugely popular in\nlate-Victorian England. \" In a review of his work published by\nRIBA in the year of his death, Maurice Adams wrote that \"his architectural\ndraughtsmanship ranks without a doubt amongst the foremost of his time and his\ngraphic capability remains unique.\" RIBA Journal Volume XXVIII
