{"cursor":"1786","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, an 'argument' of a function is a specific input in the function,\nalso known as an independent variable. When it is clear from the context which\nargument is meant, the argument is often denoted by arg.\n\nA mathematical function has one or more arguments in the form of independent\nvariables designated in the function's definition, which can also contain\nparameters. The independent variables are mentioned in the list of arguments\nthat the function takes, whereas the parameters are not. For example, in the\nlogarithmic function f(x) = \\log_b (x) , the base b is considered a\nparameter.\n\nA function that takes a single argument as input (such as f(x) =\nx^2 ) is called a unary function. A function of two or more variables is\nconsidered to have a domain consisting of ordered pairs or tuples of argument\nvalues. For example, the binary function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 has two\narguments, x and y, in an ordered pair (x, y) . The hypergeometric\nfunction is an example of a four-argument function. The number of arguments that\na function takes is called the arity of the function.\n\nThe argument of a circular function is an angle. The argument of a hyperbolic\nfunction is a hyperbolic angle.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Argument_of_a_function","recorded":1362540098,"links":12,"instances":["exponentiation","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary mathematics"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/5/5c541984eed1aab62b62da0a5e77a12d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/b/a/9ba07c50b2f5b24031759bb9918c4ed3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/c/f/7cf53e9303a78423270a788021cca856.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/0/c/90cbc22edf225adf8a68974f51227f05.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["base","exponentiation"],["domain","mathematics"],["value","mathematics"]],"members":["base","domain","function","value"],"related":["Mathematics","Function_(mathematics)","Dependent_and_independent_variables","Dependent_and_independent_variables","Parameter","Logarithmic_function","Base_(exponentiation)","Unary_function","Domain_(mathematics)","Ordered_pair","Tuple","Binary_function","Hypergeometric_function","Arity","Circular_function","Angle","Hyperbolic_function","Hyperbolic_angle","Value_(mathematics)","Parameter","Dependent_and_independent_variables"]}
