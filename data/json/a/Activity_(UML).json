Activities can be decomposed into subactivities,\n  until at the bottom we find atomic actions.\n\nThe underlying conception of an activity has changed between UML 1.5 and UML\n2.0. In UML 2.0 an activity is no longer based on the state-chart rather it is\nbased on a Petri net like coordination mechanism. There the activity represents\nuser-defined behavior coordinating actions. Actions in turn are pre-defined (UML\noffers a series of actions for this).\n","linknr":149,"url":"Activity_(UML)","recorded":1362374677,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Unified Modeling Language"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Use_case_restaurant_model.svg/100px-Use_case_restaurant_model.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Unified_Modeling_Language","Activity_diagram","Business_process","Atomic_actions","Petri_net"]}
