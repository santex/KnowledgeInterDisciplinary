{"cursor":"1898","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'autopatch', sometimes called a 'phone patch', is a feature of an amateur\nradio (or other type of two-way radio) repeater or base station to access an\noutgoing telephone connection. Users with a transceiver capable of producing\ntouch tones (DTMF signals) can make a telephone call, typically limited by\nsettings in the autopatch module to be only to toll-free numbers, such as local\ncalls or toll-free numbers. The term 'phone patch' more accurately describes a\nsystem that is dialed and connected by a user manually operating a base\nstation, which was more common before computer technology made automation of\nthe process easier.\n\nThis feature is primarily used by radio amateurs to provide emergency telephone\nconnectivity to places that have lost their telephone network access. An Amateur\nRadio Operator with a transceiver installed in their vehicle may provide\ntelephone network access from dozens or hundreds of miles away, depending on the\nfrequencies of the involved repeater/base station, the power of the transceiver,\nand the gain of the antennas on both ends.\n\nIn the United States, autopatch users are required to hang up if they encounter\nmusic on hold, as the Federal Communications Commission regulations prohibit any\nkind of music (even if incidental, unless part of an audio transmission from a\nSpace Shuttle mission) on amateur radio frequencies.\n[http://www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/news/part97/b.html#113 CFR Part\n97.113{a(4)} and {e} Prohibited Transmissions] (As Space Shuttle missions\nhave permanently ceased, the exception is no longer applicable.)\n","linknr":507,"url":"Autopatch","recorded":1362575588,"links":21,"instances":["telecommunications"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Amateur radio","Telephony"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/100px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/International_amateur_radio_symbol.svg/30px-International_amateur_radio_symbol.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["user","telecommunications"]],"members":["user"],"related":["Amateur_radio","Two-way_radio","Repeater","Base_station","Telephone","Telecommunication_circuit","User_(telecommunications)","Transceiver","Touch_tone","DTMF","Telephone_call","Toll-free","Local_call","Toll-free_number","United_States","Music_on_hold","Federal_Communications_Commission","Space_Shuttle","Carterfone"]}
