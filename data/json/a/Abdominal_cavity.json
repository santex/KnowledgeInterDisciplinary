It is\nlocated below (or inferior to) the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity.\nIts dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm (a thin sheet of muscle under the\nlungs), and its oblique floor is the pelvic inlet (the superior opening of the\npelvis). It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is\nwell connected with the pleural (thoracic) cavity.\n\nOrgans of the abdominal cavity include the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen,\npancreas, small intestine, kidneys, and large intestine.\n\nThe abdominal cavity is lined with a protective membrane termed the peritoneum.\nThe kidneys are located in the abdominal cavity behind the peritoneum, in the\nretroperitoneum. The viscera are also covered, in the front, with a layer of\nperitoneum called the greater omentum (or omental apron).\n","linknr":235,"url":"Abdominal_cavity","recorded":1362484975,"links":60,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abdomen"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Scheme_body_cavities-en.svg/250px-Scheme_body_cavities-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Gray1225.png/250px-Gray1225.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Duodenum","Pancreas","Kidneys","Body_cavity","Viscus","Anatomical_terms_of_location","Thoracic_cavity","Pelvic_cavity","Dome","Thoracic_diaphragm","Pelvic_inlet","Pelvis","Abdominopelvic_cavity","Pleural_cavity","Stomach","Liver","Gallbladder","Spleen","Pancreas","Small_intestine","Kidneys","Large_intestine","Peritoneum","Kidney","Retroperitoneum","Greater_omentum","Human_abdomen","Human_body_cavities","Coelom"]}
