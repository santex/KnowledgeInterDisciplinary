A link\nis 'alternating' if it has an alternating diagram.\n\nMany of the knots with crossing number less than 10 are alternating. This fact\nand useful properties of alternating knots, such as the Tait conjectures, was\nwhat enabled early knot tabulators, such as Tait, to construct tables with\nrelatively few mistakes or omissions. The simplest non-alternating prime knots\nhave 8 crossings (and there are three such).\n\nIt is conjectured that as the crossing number increases, the percentage of knots\nthat are alternating goes to 0 exponentially quickly.\n\nAlternating links end up having an important role in knot theory and 3-manifold\ntheory, due to their complements having useful and interesting geometric and\ntopological properties. This led Ralph Fox to ask, \"What is an alternating\nknot?\" By this he was asking what non-diagrammatic properties of the knot\ncomplement would characterize alternating knots.\n\nVarious geometric and topological information is revealed in an alternating\ndiagram. Primeness and splittability of a link is easily seen from the diagram.\nThe crossing number of a reduced, alternating diagram is the crossing number of\nthe knot. This last is one of the celebrated Tait Conjectures.\n\nAn alternating knot diagram is in one to one correspondence with a planar\ngraph. Each crossing is associated with an edge and half of the connected\ncomponents of the complement of the diagram are associated with vertices in a\nchecker board manner.\n","linknr":130,"url":"Alternating_knot","recorded":1362901358,"links":14,"instances":["mathematics","knot_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Knot theory"],"headings":["Tait conjectures","Hyperbolic volume","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Knot_8sb19.svg/250px-Knot_8sb19.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Trefle.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Frise.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["knot","mathematics"],["crossing_number","knot_theory"],["crossing_number","knot_theory"],["crossing_number","knot_theory"],["knot","mathematics"]],"members":["knot","crossing_number"],"related":["Knot_theory","Knot_(mathematics)","Prime_knot","Crossing_number_(knot_theory)","Link_complement","Ralph_Fox","Prime_knot","Split_link","Crossing_number_(knot_theory)","Reduced_diagram","Planar_graph","Reduced_diagram","Knot_diagram","Crossing_number_(knot_theory)","Reduced_diagram","Knot_diagram","Knot_(mathematics)","Writhe","Reduced_diagram","Knot_diagram","Morwen_Thistlethwaite","Louis_Kauffman","K._Murasugi","Morwen_Thistlethwaite","William_Menasco","William_Menasco","William_Thurston","Hyperbolization_theorem","Haken_manifold","Hyperbolic_link","Hyperbolic_geometry","Torus_link","Marc_Lackenby","Reduced_diagram","MathWorld"]}
