Such\na collection is usually called an 'array variable', 'array value', or simply\n'array'. Robert W. Sebesta (2001) Concepts of Programming\nLanguages. Addison-Wesley. 4th edition (1998), 5th edition (2001), ISBN 0-201-38596-\n1 ISBN13: 9780201385960 By analogy with the mathematical concepts of\nvector and matrix, array types with one and two indices are often called 'vector\ntype' and 'matrix type', respectively.\n\nLanguage support for array types may include certain built-in array data types,\nsome syntactic constructions (array type constructors) that the programmer may\nuse to define such types and declare array variables, and special notation for\nindexing array elements. For example, in the Pascal\nprogramming language, the declaration type MyTable = array [1..4,1..2] of\ninteger , defines a new array data type called MyTable . The\ndeclaration var A: MyTable then defines a variable A\nof that type, which is an aggregate of eight elements, each being an integer\nvariable identified by two indices. In the Pascal program, those elements are\ndenoted A[1,1] , A[1,2] , A[2,1] ,â¦\nA[4,2] .K. Jensen and Niklaus Wirth, PASCAL User\nManual and Report. Springer. Paperback edition (2007) 184 pages, ISBN 3-540-06950-\nX ISBN 978-3540069508 Special array types are often defined by the\nlanguage's standard libraries.\n\nArray types are distinguished from record types mainly because they allow\nthe element indices to be computed at run time, as in the Pascal assignment\nA[I,J] := A[N-I,2*J] . Among other things, this feature allows\na single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an\narray variable.\n\nIn more theoretical contexts, especially in type theory and in the description\nof abstract algorithms, the terms \"array\" and \"array type\" sometimes refer to an\nabstract data type (ADT) also called abstract array or may refer to an\n[[associative array]], a mathematical model with the basic operations and\nbehavior of a typical array type in most languages â basically, a collection of\nelements that are selected by indices computed at run-time.\n\nDepending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other\ndata types that describe aggregates of values, such as lists and strings. Array\ntypes are often implemented by array data structures, but sometimes by other\nmeans, such as hash tables, linked lists, or search trees.\n","linknr":353,"url":"Array_data_type","recorded":1362540260,"links":49,"instances":["computing","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","programming_language","program_lifecycle_phase","computer_science","mathematics","programming_language","computer_science","mathematics","programming_language","computer_science","array","computer_programming","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arrays|*","Data types","Composite data types"],"headings":["History","Abstract arrays","Implementations","Language support","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Array_of_array_storage.svg/120px-Array_of_array_storage.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["value","computer_science"],["variable","computer_science"],["run_time","program_lifecycle_phase"],["vector","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"],["library","computer_science"],["record","computer_science"],["run_time","program_lifecycle_phase"],["statement","computer_science"],["list","computing"],["string","computer_science"],["aliasing","computing"],["integer","computer_science"],["interval","mathematics"],["string","computer_science"],["reference","computer_science"],["rank","computer_programming"],["matrix","mathematics#definition"],["reference","computer_science"],["ada","programming_language"],["lua","programming_language"],["exception","computer_science"],["comparison_of_programming_languages","array"],["string","computer_science"],["c","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["list","computer_science"],["comparison_of_programming_languages","array"]],"members":["aliasing","variable","string","library","matrix","reference","integer","record","statement","ada","run_time","list","vector","python","value","interval","c","exception","comparison_of_programming_languages","rank","lua"],"related":["Computer_science","Data_type","Value_(computer_science)","Variable_(computer_science)","Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)","Vector_(mathematics)","Matrix_(mathematics)","Built-in_type","Programmer","Pascal_programming_language","Library_(computer_science)","Record_(computer_science)","Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)","Assignment_statement","Statement_(computer_science)","Type_theory","Algorithm","Abstract_data_type","Mathematics","List_(computing)","String_(computer_science)","Array_data_structure","Hash_table","Linked_list","Search_tree","FORTRAN","COBOL","Algol_60","Abstract_data_structure","Tuple","Axiom","Aliasing_(computing)","Triangular_array","Array_data_structure","Pointer_arithmetic","Integer_(computer_science)","Byte","Enumerated_type","Interval_(mathematics)","Compiler","Compile_time","Floating_point","String_(computer_science)","Object-oriented_programming","Reference_(computer_science)","Associative_array","Hash_table","Search_data_structure","Rank_(computer_programming)","Tensor_rank","Matrix_rank","Iliffe_vector","Reference_(computer_science)","Third-generation_programming_language","Systems_programming_language","Ada_(programming_language)","C_programming_language","C++","Scripting_languages","Awk_programming_language","Lua_(programming_language)","C++","Bounds_checking","Exception_(computer_science)","Bounds-checking_elimination","Zero-based_numbering","Sequence","Off-by-one_error","Fencepost_error","Edsger_W._Dijkstra","Comparison_of_programming_languages_(array)","Visual_Basic_.NET","APL_programming_language","Matlab","Fortran","Array_programming","Matrix_product","Linear_algebra","String_(computer_science)","Pascal_programming_language","C_(programming_language)","C++","C++","Array_slicing","Dope_vector","Python_(programming_language)","List_(computer_science)","Dynamic_array","Array_access_analysis","Array_programming","Array_slicing","Bounds_checking","Index_checking","Bounds_checking_elimination","Delimiter-separated_values","Comparison_of_programming_languages_(array)","Parallel_array","Variable-length_array","Dynamic_array","Sparse_array"]}
