{"cursor":"13644","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Allopatric speciation' (from the ancient Greek allos, \"other\" + Greek patra,\n\"fatherland\") or 'geographic speciation' is speciation that occurs when\nbiological populations of the same species become vicariant â€” isolated\nfrom each other to an extent that prevents or interferes with genetic\ninterchange. This can be the result of population dispersal leading to\nemigration, or by geographical changes such as mountain formation, island\nformation, or large scale human activities (for example agricultural and civil\nengineering developments). The vicariant populations then undergo genotypic or\nphenotypic divergence as: (a) they become subjected to different selective\npressures, (b) they independently undergo genetic drift, and (c) different\nmutations arise in the populations' gene pools.\n\nThe separate populations over time may evolve distinctly different\ncharacteristics. If the geographical barriers are later removed, members of the\ntwo populations may be unable to successfully mate with each other, at which\npoint, the genetically isolated groups have emerged as different species.\nAllopatric isolation is a key factor in speciation and a common process by which\nnew species arise. Adaptive radiation, as observed by Charles Darwin\nin Galapagos finches, is a consequence of allopatric speciation among island\npopulations.\n","linknr":415,"url":"Allopatric_speciation","recorded":1362483538,"links":30,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/index/R0Q2143R8852824N.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/R0Q2143R8852824N.pdf"],"categories":["Ecology","Speciation","Biology terminology","Ecology terminology","Scientific classification"],"headings":["Isolating mechanisms","Allopatric speciation in peripheral populations","Genesis of reproductive barriers","Alternative modes of speciation","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg/200px-CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/16px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Speciation_modes.svg/360px-Speciation_modes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Drosophila_speciation_experiment.svg/425px-Drosophila_speciation_experiment.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hybrid","biology"],["hybrid","biology"]],"members":["hybrid"],"related":["Speciation","Populations","Vicariance","Biological_dispersal","Emigration","Mountain_formation","Island","Agricultural","Civil_engineering","Genotypic","Phenotypic","Genetic_drift","Mutations","Gene_pool","Evolution","Adaptive_radiation","Charles_Darwin","Galapagos_finches","Parapatric_speciation","Sympatric_speciation","Speciation","Vicariance","Biogeography","Organism","Sister_species","Glacier","Land_bridge","Subsidence","Plate_tectonics","Western_United_States","Animal_migration","Founder_effect","Genetic_drift","Evolution","Natural_selection","Ernst_Mayr","Epistasis","Hybrid_(biology)","Infertility","Genetics","Phenotype","Hybrid_(biology)","Subspecies","Sympatric_speciation","Parapatric_speciation","Heteropatric_speciation","Small_population_size","Genotypes","Gene","Sympatric_speciation","Polyploidy","Parapatric_speciation","African_Elephant","DNA","Subspecies","University_of_California,_San_Diego","West_Africa","Savanna","Asian_Elephant","Continent","Mallard","New_Zealand","Pacific_Black_Duck","Yellow-billed_duck","Disjunct_distribution","Habitat_fragmentation","Sympatric"]}
