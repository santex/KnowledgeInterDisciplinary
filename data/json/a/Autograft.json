Tissue transplanted\nby such \"'autologous'\" procedure is referred to as an 'autograft' or\n'autotransplant'. It is contrasted with xenotransplantation (from other species)\nand allotransplantation (from other individual of same species). A common\nexample is when a piece of bone (usually from the hip) is removed and ground\ninto a paste when reconstructing another portion of bone.\n","linknr":280,"url":"Autograft","recorded":1362506235,"links":18,"instances":["anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Transfusion medicine","Orthopedic surgery","Transplantation medicine"],"headings":["Autologous blood donation","Bone autograft","Autologous organ graft","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"]],"members":["organ"],"related":["Organ_transplant","Organ_(anatomy)","Biological_tissue","Protein","Xenotransplantation","Allotransplantation","Blood_banking","Blood_donation","Blood_type","Antibody","Hepatitis","HIV","Allergy","HIV","Cardiac","Child","Orthopaedics","Bone_grafting","Allograft","Bone_morphogenetic_protein","Decellularization","Allograft","Autotransfusion","Replantation","Rotationplasty"]}
