The A-10 was designed for a United States Air Force (USAF) requirement to\nprovide close air support (CAS) for ground forces by attacking tanks, armored\nvehicles, and other ground targets with a limited air defense capability. It was\nthe first USAF aircraft designed solely for CAS.\n\nThe A-10 was designed around the GAU-8 Avenger, a heavy rotary cannon that\nforms the aircraft's primary armament. (It is, to date, the heaviest rotary\ncannon ever mounted on an aircraft.) The aircraft's hull incorporates over of\narmor and was designed with survivability as a priority, with protective\nmeasures in place which enable the aircraft to continue flying even after\ntaking significant damage.\n\nThe A-10's official name comes from the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt of World War\nII, a fighter that was particularly effective at close air support. The A-10 is\nmore commonly known by its nickname '\"Warthog\"' or simply '\"Hog\"'. As a\nsecondary mission, it provides airborne forward air control, guiding other\naircraft against ground targets. A-10s used primarily in this role are\ndesignated OA-10. With a variety of upgrades and wing replacements, the A-10's\nservice life has been extended to 2040.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"A-10_Thunderbolt_II","recorded":1372155154,"links":[],"instances":["wing","radar_countermeasure","aircraft","state","rocket","pilot","flight","countermeasure"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anti-tank
