It covers\nresearch on the Earth's atmosphere and the underlying chemical and physical\nprocesses, including the altitude range from the land and ocean surface up to\nthe turbopause, including the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The\nmain subject areas comprise atmospheric modelling, field measurements, remote\nsensing, and laboratory studies of gases, aerosols, clouds and precipitation,\nisotopes, radiation, dynamics, and biosphere and hydrosphere interactions.\nArticle types published are research and review articles, technical notes, and\ncommentaries.\n\nThe journal has a two-stage publication process. In the first stage, papers\nthat pass a rapid access peer-review are immediately published on the\nAtmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions forum website. They are then\nsubject to interactive public peer review, including the referees' comments\n(anonymous or attributed), additional comments by other members of the\nscientific community (attributed), and the authors' replies. In the second\nstage, if accepted, the final revised papers are published in the journal. To\nensure publication precedence for authors, and to provide a lasting record of\nthe scientific discussion, both the journal and the forum are permanently\narchived and fully citable.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Atmospheric_Chemistry_and_Physics","recorded":1362540443,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Earth and atmospheric sciences journals","Biweekly journals","English-language journals","Publications established in 2001","Geophysics journals","Journals with a Creative Commons Attribution License","European Geosciences Union academic journals"],"headings":["Abstracting and indexing","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Cover_of_the_journal_Atmospheric_Chemistry_and_Physics.png/200px-Cover_of_the_journal_Atmospheric_Chemistry_and_Physics.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Geosciences","Ulrich_Pöschl","Copernicus_Publications","European_Geosciences_Union","Creative_Commons_Attribution_License","Open_access","Peer_review","Scientific_journal","European_Geosciences_Union","Atmosphere_of_Earth","Turbopause","Troposphere","Stratosphere","Mesosphere","Aerosol","Isotope","Biosphere","Hydrosphere","Public_peer_review","Web_of_Science","Science_Citation_Index","Current_Contents","Scopus","Astrophysics_Data_System","Chemical_Abstracts","GeoRef","Atmospheric_chemistry"]}
