      "text" : "\n\n\n\nAn 'attractor' is a set towards which a variable, moving according to the\ndictates of a dynamical system, evolves over time. That is, points that get\nclose enough to the attractor remain close even if slightly disturbed. The\nevolving variable may be represented algebraically as an n-dimensional vector.\nThe attractor is a region in ''n''-dimensional space. In physical systems, the n\ndimensions may be, for example, two or three positional coordinates for each of\none or more physical entities; in economic systems, they may be separate\nvariables such as the inflation rate and the unemployment rate.\n\nIf the evolving variable is two- or three-dimensional, the attractor of the\ndynamic process can be represented geometrically in two or three dimensions, (as\nfor example in the three-dimensional case depicted to the right). An attractor\ncan be a point, a finite set of points, a curve, a manifold, or even a\ncomplicated set with a fractal structure known as a [[Attractor#Strange\nattractor|strange attractor]]. If the variable is a scalar, the attractor is a\nsubset of the real number line. Describing the attractors of chaotic dynamical\nsystems has been one of the achievements of chaos theory.\n\nA trajectory of the dynamical system in the attractor does not have to satisfy\nany special constraints except for remaining on the attractor. The trajectory\nmay be periodic or chaotic. If a set of points is periodic or chaotic, but the\nflow in the neighbourhood is away from the set, the set is not an attractor, but\ninstead is called a 'repeller' (or [[repellor]]).\n",
