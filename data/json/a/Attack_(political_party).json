The party takes anti-\nelitarian populist stances and leftist positions on economic policy. It\nadvocates the re-nationalisation of privatized companies and wants to prioritize\nspending on education, healthcare and welfare. It opposed\nthe Bulgarian membership in the NATO and the European Union.\nIn 2006, the party concluded an agreement with the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian\nOrthodox Church.\n\nIn the Bulgarian parliamentary elections of 2005 and 2009, Attack was the fourth-\nstrongest party and won 21 of the 240 seats. In the presidential election 2006,\nSiderov was placed second and qualified for the run-off, in 2011 he played only\na minor role and was placed fourth. In the last election for the European\nParliament, Attack won two of the 18 Bulgarian seats.\n\nSeveral scholars consider the Attack party ultranationalist, and designate\nits leader Volen Siderov an ultranationalist too. The organization's orientation and rhetoric is\ndescribed as racist, especially antisemitic and anti-Roma as well as\nxenophobic.\n","linknr":436,"url":"Attack_(political_party)","recorded":1362567956,"links":37,"instances":["bulgaria","bulgaria","france","bulgaria","politician","bulgaria","bulgaria","bulgaria","television","politician","bulgaria","bulgarian_tv_channel"],"pdf":["http://ataka.bg/Programa_ATAKA_PLAN.pdf","http://ataka.bg/Programa_ATAKA_PLAN.pdf"],"categories":["Nationalist
