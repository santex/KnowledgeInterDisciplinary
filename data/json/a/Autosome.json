{"cursor":"2675","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'autosome' is a chromosome that is not an allosome (i.e., not a sex\nchromosome). Autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same\nform but which differ from other pairs in a diploid cell, whereas members of an\nallosome pair may differ from one another and thereby determine sex. For\nexample, in humans there are typically 22 pairs of autosomes and one allosome\npair. The allosome pair consists of two X chromosomes (female) or one X and one\nY chromosome (male). (Unusual combinations are XYY, XXY, XXX, XXXX, XXXXX or\nXXYY, among other allosome combinations, are known to occur. These generally\ncause developmental abnormalities.) The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers\n(1-22 in humans), and allosomes are labeled with their letters.\n\nAn autosome is any of the numbered chromosomes, as opposed to the sex\nchromosomes. Humans have 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes\n(the X and Y). Autosomes are numbered roughly in relation to their sizes in base\npairs. A chromosome not involved in sex determination. The diploid human genome\nconsists of a total of 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of autosomes, and 1 pair of sex\nchromosomes (the X and Y chromosomes).\nhttp://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=autosome\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"width: 75%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|Human chromosomes\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|Female (XX) |align=\"center\"|Male (XY)\n|-\n|\n|\n|- colspan=\"2\"|There are two copies of each 'autosome' (chromosomes 1-22) in\n|both females and males.
