{"cursor":"7737","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'atmospheric water generator' ('AWG'), is a device that extracts water from\nhumid ambient air. Water vapor in the air is condensed by cooling the air below\nits dew point, exposing the air to desiccants, or pressurizing the air. Unlike a\ndehumidifier, an AWG is designed to render the water potable. AWGs are useful\nwhere pure drinking water is difficult or impossible to obtain, because there is\nalmost always a small amount of water in the air. The two primary techniques in\nuse are cooling and desiccants.\n\nThe extraction of atmospheric water may not be completely free of cost, because\nsignificant input of energy is required to drive some AWG processes, sometimes\ncalled \"trading oil for water\". Certain traditional AWG methods are completely\npassive, relying on natural temperature changes, and requiring no external\nenergy source. Research has also developed AWG technologies to produce useful\nyields of water at a reduced (but non-zero) energy cost.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Atmospheric_water_generator","recorded":1362372129,"links":13,"instances":["condenser"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drinking water","Water supply","Water development and sustainability"],"headings":["History","Modern technologies","In greenhouses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Atmospheric_Water_Generator_diagram.jpg/220px-Atmospheric_Water_Generator_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["air_well","condenser"],["air_well","condenser"]],"members":["air_well"],"related":["Humidity","Condensation","Dew_point","Desiccant","Dehumidifier","Potable_water","Air_well_(condenser)","Cisterns","Fog_collection","Dehumidifier","Desiccant","Lithium_chloride","Lithium_bromide","Hygroscopy","Silica_gel","Zeolite","Gas_compressor","Refrigerant","Dew_point","Relative_humidity","Brine","Engine-generator","Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency","Passive_solar","Seawater_greenhouse","Air_well_(condenser)","Dew_pond","Fog_collection","Rainwater_harvesting","Solar_chimney","Watermaker","Solar_still"]}
