{"cursor":"1414","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Canada]] An 'articled clerk', also known as an 'articling student', is an\napprentice in a professional firm in Commonwealth countries; generally the term\narises in the accountancy and legal professions. The articled clerk signs a\ncontract, known as \"articles of clerkship\", committing to a fixed period of\nemployment. Wharton's Law Lexicon defines an articled clerk as \"a pupil of a\nsolicitor, who undertakes, by articles of clerkship, continuing covenants,\nmutually binding, to instruct him in the principles and practice of the\nprofession\". The contract is with a specific partner in the firm and not with\nthe firm as a whole.\n\nNowadays some professions in some countries prefer to call their apprentices\n\"students\" or \"trainees\" (e.g. a trainee solicitor) and the articles of\nclerkship \"training contracts\".\n","linknr":103,"url":"Articled_clerk","recorded":1362576003,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal professions","Solicitors","Lawyers by type","Accounting in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Articling_students_in_Ottawa_Canada.jpg/220px-Articling_students_in_Ottawa_Canada.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Accountancy_template.svg/40px-Accountancy_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Apprentice","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Accountancy","Law_firm","Partnership","Trainee_solicitor","Training_contract"]}
