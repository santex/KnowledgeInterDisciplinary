Usually, but not always, it consists of a letter or group of\nletters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word abbreviation can\nitself be represented by the abbreviation abbr., abbrv. or abbrev.\n\nIn strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with contractions or\nacronyms (including initialisms), with which they share some semantic and\nphonetic functions, though all three are connoted by the term \"abbreviation\" in\nloose parlance.<ref name=harts></ref>An abbreviation is a shortening by any\nmethod; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the\nparts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or syllables\nand bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation\nmay be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a\npart. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a\ncontraction. However, normally, acronyms are regarded as a subgroup of\nabbreviations (e.g. by the Council of Science Editors). Abbreviations can also\nbe used to give a different context to the word itself, such as \"PIN Number\"\n(wherein if the abbreviation were removed the context would be invalid).\n","title":"Abbreviation","headings":["History","Style conventions in English","Measurement shorthand â€“ symbol or abbreviation","Syllabic abbreviation","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Reverend","2: International_System_of_Units","2: Japanese_language","1: Latin","1: Phrase","1: Acronym","1: Semantic","1: Phonetic","1: Syllable","1: Council_of_Science_Editors","1: Ancient_Greece","1: Ancient_Rome","1: English_language","1: Philology","1: J._R._R._Tolkien","1: C._S._Lewis","1: Oxford","1: Inklings","1: Boston","1: Okay","1: World_War_II","1: Full_stop","1: Special_Operations,_Executive","1: French_language","1: English_Channel","1: Personal_computer","1: Television","1: IBM_Selectric_typewriter#Ribbons","1: Mobile_phone#Mobile_phones_in_society","1: Internet#Social_impact","1: Instant_messaging","1: Text_messaging","1: Short_Message_Service","1: GSM_03.38","1: SMS_language","1: Twitter","1: Social_network_service","1: Modern_English","1: Style_guide","1: British_English","1: Hart's_Rules","1: Professor","1: The_Right_Honourable","1: American_English","1: Manual_on_Uniform_Traffic_Control_Devices","1: Sonar","1: Radar","1: Lidar","1: Laser","1: SNAFU","1: Scuba_set","1: Runs_Batted_In","1: Associated_Press","1: U.S._Government","1: U.S._Government_Printing_Office","1: National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","1: BBC","1: North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation","1: Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome","1: Welsh_language","1: David_Lloyd_George","1: Gary_Blake","1: Robert_W._Bly","1: New_York_City","1: Inch","1: Kilometre","1: Afrikaans_language","1: Middle_dot","1: Lower_case","1: Capital_letter","1: Portmanteau","1: Nazi_Germany","1: Newspeak","1: German_language","1: German_Democratic_Republic","1: Agfa-Gevaert","1: Hanuta","1: Haribo","1: Ideogram","1: Chinese_character","1: United_Nations","1: Japanese_abbreviated_and_contracted_words","1: Peking_University","1: University_of_Tokyo","1: List_of_acronyms","1: List_of_classical_abbreviations","1: List_of_medieval_abbreviations","1: List_of_abbreviations_used_in_medical_prescriptions","1: List_of_abbreviations_in_photography"]}
