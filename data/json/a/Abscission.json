{"cursor":"5867","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Abscission' (from the Latin ab meaning away and scindere meaning to cut) is a\nterm used in several areas of biology. In plant sciences, it most commonly\nrefers to the process by which a plant drops one or more of its parts, such as a\nleaf, fruit, flower or seed. In zoology, the term may be used to describe the\nintentional shedding of a body part, such as the shedding of a claw husk, or the\nautotomy of a tail to evade a predator. In mycology, it may refer to the\nliberation of a fungal spore. In cell biology, abscission refers to the\nseparation of two daughter cells at the completion of cytokinesis.\n","linknr":175,"url":"Abscission","recorded":1362482719,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant anatomy","Plant morphology"],"headings":["Abscission in plants","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/3._Nectarine_wilted_flower%2C_SC%2C_Vic%2C_Aust.jpg/220px-3._Nectarine_wilted_flower%2C_SC%2C_Vic%2C_Aust.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Streptocarpus_leaf_with_abcission_line.JPG/220px-Streptocarpus_leaf_with_abcission_line.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg/32px-Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Latin","Plant_science","Plant","Leaf","Fruit","Flower","Seed","Zoology","Claw","Autotomy","Mycology","Spore","Cytokinesis","Fertilisation","Reproduction","Deciduous","Evergreen","Water","Photosynthetic","Plant_defense","Aphids","Galls","Deciduous","Chlorophyll","Aphid","The_Daily_Telegraph","Hydrogen_peroxide","Superoxide","Singlet_oxygen","Radical_hydroxyl","Biotic_component","Abiotic","UV_light","Salinity","Homeostasis","Metabolic","Auxin","Ethylene","Synergistic","Polygalacturonase","Abscisic_acid","Marcescence"]}
