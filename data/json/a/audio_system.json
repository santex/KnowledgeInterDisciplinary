      "text" : "\n\n\n'Sound recording and reproduction' is an electrical or mechanical inscription\nand re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental\nmusic, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are\nanalog recording and digital recording. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by\na small microphone diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure\n(acoustic sound waves) and record them as a graphic representation of the sound\nwaves on a medium such as a phonograph (in which a stylus senses grooves on a\nrecord). In magnetic tape recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone\ndiaphragm and are converted into a varying electric current, which is then\nconverted to a varying magnetic field by an electromagnet, which makes a\nrepresentation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a\nmagnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a\nbigger loudspeaker diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form\nacoustic sound waves. Electronically generated sound waves may also be recorded\ndirectly from devices such as an electric guitar pickup or a synthesizer,\nwithout the use of acoustics in the recording process other than the need for\nmusicians to hear how well they are playing during recording sessions.\n\nDigital recording and reproduction converts the analog sound signal picked up by\nthe microphone to a digital form by a process of digitization, allowing it to be\nstored and transmitted by a wider variety of media. Digital recording stores\naudio as a series of binary numbers representing samples of the amplitude of the\naudio signal at equal time intervals, at a sample rate high enough to convey all\nsounds capable of being heard. Digital recordings are considered higher quality\nthan analog recordings not necessarily because they have higher fidelity (wider\nfrequency response or dynamic range), but because the digital format can prevent\nmuch loss of quality found in analog recording due to noise and electromagnetic\ninterference in playback, and mechanical deterioration or damage to the storage\nmedium. A digital audio signal must be reconverted to analog form during\nplayback before it is applied to a loudspeaker or earphones. recording Blackfoot\nchief Mountain Chief on a cylinder phonograph for the Bureau of American\nEthnology (1916)]]\n",
