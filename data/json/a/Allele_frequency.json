{"cursor":"7176","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Allele frequency' or 'Gene frequency' is the proportion of all copies of a gene\nthat is made up of a particular gene variant (allele). In other words, it is the\nnumber of copies of a particular allele divided by the number of copies of all\nalleles at the genetic place (locus) in a population. It can be expressed for\nexample as a percentage. In population genetics, allele frequencies are used to\ndepict the amount of genetic diversity at the individual, population, and\nspecies level. It is also the relative proportion of all alleles of a gene that\nare of a designated type.\n\nGiven the following: # a particular locus on a chromosome and the gene occupying\nthat locus\n# a population of N individuals carrying n loci in each of their somatic cells\n# (e.g. two loci in the cells of diploid species, which contain two sets of\n# chromosomes) different alleles of the gene exist one allele exists in a copies\n\nthen the allele frequency is the fraction or percentage of all the occurrences\nof that locus that is occupied by a given allele and the frequency of one of the\nalleles is a/(n*N).\n\nFor example, if the frequency of an allele is 20% in a given population, then\namong population members, one in five chromosomes will carry that allele. Four\nout of five will be occupied by other variant(s) of the gene.\n\nNote that for diploid genes the fraction of individuals that carry this allele\nmay be nearly two in five (36%). The reason for this is that if the allele\ndistributes randomly, then the binomial theorem will apply: 32% of the\npopulation will be heterozygous for the allele (i.e. carry one copy of that\nallele and one copy of another in each somatic cell) and 4% will be homozygous\n(carrying two copies of the allele). Together, this means that 36% of diploid\nindividuals would be expected to carry an allele that has a frequency of 20%.\nHowever, alleles distribute randomly only under certain assumptions, including\nthe absence of selection. When these conditions apply, a population is said to\nbe in HardyâWeinberg equilibrium.\n\nThe frequencies of all the alleles of a given gene often are graphed together as\nan allele [[frequency distribution]] [[histogram]], or [[allele frequency\nspectrum]]. Population genetics studies the different \"forces\" that might lead\nto changes in the distribution and frequencies of allelesâin other words, to\nevolution. Besides selection, these forces include genetic drift, mutation and\nmigration.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Allele_frequency","recorded":1362483361,"links":28,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Population genetics","Genetic genealogy"],"headings":["Calculation of allele frequencies from genotype frequencies","An example population","The effect of mutation","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/9/7/897b097a0ff9ee6fe579c1d9129978ef.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/d/35d1248dab65509b5e838c9fd3be6300.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/9/c/29c662f78660c43b2d1ff32c3919e0ae.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/0/fc06f40c1deb4734310ff1d2884e11ca.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/9/9/a99a4ab4d2dd86d8873dbd1db50f6c83.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/0/e503e7c0e8fe0e91f428c70eda5f8b1e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/5/d55cc79a57c061f065ebe39f25e6e27e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/8/fa86501d3d59ce112b38a780f58fe480.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/1/c61c0ea12581b17b3e206762ad6363e0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/b/3/fb33d6ded7ad64784ff3547e05edf590.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/2/8/e2857b36aa31de5b4d6acd9047f66917.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/9/e19d828ed82628e5bdf628a33041bda1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/a/a5a9f8aa677dbcd47b3b7c11af2976f4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/6/8c655f0be3c12c08976eac8c8e0bb97b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/a/a/7aa41487a1a40b0077afa0c3331ba111.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/7/5e71e3501bba4fe4dffa13da3657fc3e.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"]],"members":["locus"],"related":["Allele","Locus_(genetics)","Population","Percentage","Population_genetics","Genetics","Species","Chromosome","Gene","Somatic_cell","Diploid","Random","Binomial_theorem","Heterozygous","Homozygous","Selection","Hardy–Weinberg_principle","Evolution","Genetic_drift","Mutation","Locus_(genetics)","Genotype_frequency","Genotype","Mutation_rate","Single-nucleotide_polymorphism","Allele_frequency_net_database"]}
