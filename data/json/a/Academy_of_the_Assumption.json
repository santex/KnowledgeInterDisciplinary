Most buildings have since been\ndemolished, replaced by luxury high-rise condominiums that dot the area's\nskyline. However, some buildings are still standing and in use. The Assumption\nChapel remains active, now a part of St. Jude Melkite Catholic Church.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Academy_of_the_Assumption","recorded":1362585525,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Defunct Roman Catholic schools in the United States","Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami","Defunct schools in Florida"],"headings":["Notable Alumni","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Stjudechurch.jpg/220px-Stjudechurch.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/School.svg/30px-School.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Miami","Florida","Miami-Dade_County,_Florida","United_States","Private_school","Catholic","Catholic","Biscayne_Bay","Miami","Florida","Religious_of_the_Assumption","St._Jude_Melkite_Catholic_Church","Cristina_Saralegui","The_Miami_News","Eliott_Rodriguez","The_Miami_Daily_News"]}
