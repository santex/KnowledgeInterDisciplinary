He is commonly known as\n\"the Father of Microbiology\", and considered to be the first microbiologist. He\nis best known for his work on the improvement of the microscope and for his\ncontributions towards the establishment of microbiology. Using his handcrafted\nmicroscopes, he was the first to observe and describe single-celled organisms,\nwhich he originally referred to as [[animalcules]], and which are now referred\nto as microorganisms. He was also the first to record microscopic observations\nof muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa, and blood flow in capillaries (small\nblood vessels). Van Leeuwenhoek did not author any books, although he did write\nmany letters.\n","linknr":386,"url":"Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek","recorded":1362557337,"links":95,"instances":["delft","overijssel"],"pdf":["http://www.brianjford.com/Lab%20News%20Sept%20pA4-A6.pdf"],"categories":["1632 births","1723 deaths","Dutch Christians","Dutch scientists","Fellows of the Royal Society","Microscopists","Opticians","People from Delft","People of the Dutch Golden Age","Protistologists","Scientific instrument makers","Burials at the Oude Kerk, Delft"],"headings":["Early involvement with the microscope","Eventual recognition by the Royal Society of London","Discoveries","Religious interpretations of his discoveries","Possible Vermeer connection","See also","Footnotes","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek_Signature.svg/128px-Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek_Signature.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg/13px-Speaker_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Leeuwenhoek_Microscope.png/170px-Leeuwenhoek_Microscope.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Sir_William_Davidson_of_Curriehill_Abraham_Lambertsz_van_den_Tempel.jpg/220px-Sir_William_Davidson_of_Curriehill_Abraham_Lambertsz_van_den_Tempel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Graf_Leeuwenhoek.jpg/220px-Graf_Leeuwenhoek.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Leeuwenhoek_Eschenholz.jpg/170px-Leeuwenhoek_Eschenholz.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Van_Leeuwenhoek%27s_microscopes_by_Henry_Baker.jpg/220px-Van_Leeuwenhoek%27s_microscopes_by_Henry_Baker.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/The_Geographer.jpg/220px-The_Geographer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["oude_kerk","delft"],["kampen","overijssel"]],"members":["oude_kerk","kampen"],"related":["Jan_Verkolje","Delft","Dutch_Republic","Dutch_Republic","Microscopist","Biologist","Protozoa","Red_blood_cell","Dutch_Reformed_Church","Dutch_language","English_language","Netherlands","Scientist","Delft","Netherlands","Fathers_of_scientific_fields","Microbiology","Microscope","Unicellular_organism","Microorganism","Muscle","Bacterium","Spermatozoon","Blood","Capillary","Blood_vessel","Royal_Society","Robert_Hooke","Anthonie_van_Leeuwenhoek","Abraham_van_den_Tempel","Royal_Society","Netherlands","Physician","Regnier_de_Graaf","Philosophical_Transactions","Delft","Midriff","Oude_Kerk_(Delft)","Brian_J._Ford","Brian_J._Ford","Infusoria","Protist","Zoology","Bacteria","Selenomonad","Vacuole","Spermatozoon","Muscle","Kampen_(Overijssel)","Netherlands","Coffee_bean","Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","William_III_of_England","Joan_Huydecoper_II","Hortus_Botanicus_Amsterdam","Nicolaes_Witsen","Tartaria","Mineral","Amur_River","Peter_the_Great","Robert_Boyle","Nicolaas_Hartsoeker","Cochineal","Dye","Berry","Insect","Novosibirsk_State_Medical_Academy","Calvinism","Johannes_Vermeer","Spontaneous_generation","Johannes_Vermeer","Executor","Bill_Bryson","Camera_obscura","Hockney–Falco_thesis","Old_Master","Scientific_revolution","Royal_Society","Brian_J._Ford","Delft","Netherlands","Delft","Netherlands"]}
