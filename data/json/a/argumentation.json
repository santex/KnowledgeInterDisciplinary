It includes the arts and sciences of civil debate,\ndialogue, conversation, and persuasion. It studies rules of inference, logic,\nand procedural rules in both artificial and real world settings.\n\nArgumentation includes debate and negotiation which are concerned with\nreaching mutually acceptable conclusions. It also encompasses eristic dialog,\nthe branch of social debate in which victory over an opponent is the primary\ngoal. This art and science is often the means by which people protect their\nbeliefs or self-interests in rational dialogue, in common parlance, and during\nthe process of arguing.\n\nArgumentation is used in law, for example in trials, in preparing an argument to\nbe presented to a court, and in testing the validity of certain kinds of\nevidence. Also, argumentation scholars study the post hoc rationalizations by\nwhich organizational actors try to justify decisions they have made\nirrationally.\n","title":"Argumentation%20theory","headings":["Key components of argumentation","Internal structure of arguments","Argumentation and the grounds of knowledge","Approaches to argumentation in communication and informal logic","Kinds of argumentation","Psychological aspects","Theories","Artificial intelligence","See also","Notes","Sources","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["3: Charles_Arthur_Willard","3: Stephen_Toulmin","2: Premise","2: Artificial_intelligence","2: Negotiation","2: Eristic","2: Fallacy","2: Informal_logic","2: Joseph_W._Wenzel","2: Harald_Wohlrapp","2: University_of_Amsterdam","2: Low_information_voter","2: Rhetoric","2: Dialectic","1: Reasoning","1: Dialogue","1: Persuasion","1: Inference","1: Logic","1: Debate","1: Law","1: Validity","1: Legal_burden_of_proof","1: Evidence","1: Cogency","1: Information","1: Inquiry","1: Deliberation","1: Dialectical","1: Plato","1: Socrates","1: Foundationalism","1: Epistemology","1: Philosophy","1: Idealism","1: Karl_R._Wallace","1: Sociology_of_knowledge","1: Pragmatism","1: John_Dewey","1: Richard_Rorty","1: Linguistic_turn","1: Empirical","1: Social_epistemology","1: Ethnomethodology","1: Speech_acts","1: Sociology_of_science","1: Social_psychology","1: Dennis_S._Gouran","1: Daniel_J._O'Keefe","1: G._Thomas_Goodnight","1: Robin_Rowland","1: Dale_Hample","1: C._Scott_Jacobs","1: Sally_Jackson","1: David_Zarefsky","1: University_of_Windsor","1: Douglas_Walton","1: Michael_Scriven","1: International_Society_for_the_Study_of_Argumentation","1: National_Communication_Association","1: American_Forensics_Association","1: Ontario_Society_for_the_Study_of_Argumentation","1: Interactional_sociolinguistics","1: Logical_truth","1: Samuel_L._Popkin","1: Ballot_box","1: Incumbent","1: Political_consulting","1: Disinformation","1: Psychology","1: Propaganda","1: Syllogism","1: Ludwig_Wittgenstein","1: Language-game","1: Toulmin_Model_of_Argument","1: Wayne_Brockriede","1: Douglas_Ehninger","1: Frans_H._van_Eemeren","1: Rob_Grootendorst","1: Non-monotonic_logic","1: A_fortiori_argument","1: Analysis_of_subjective_logics","1: Argumentation_ethics","1: Critical_thinking","1: Criticism","1: Defeasible_reasoning","1: Discourse_ethics","1: Essentially_contested_concepts","1: Forensics","1: Legal_theory","1: Logical_argument","1: Pars_destruens/pars_construens","1: Public_Sphere","1: Rationality","1: Sophistry","1: Source_criticism","1: Yale_University_Press","1: Chaim_Perelman","1: Douglas_Neil_Walton","1: University_of_Alabama_Press"]}
