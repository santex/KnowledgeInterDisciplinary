{"cursor":"8312","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn chemistry and physics, the 'atomic number' (also known as the 'proton\nnumber') is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom and therefore\nidentical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented\nby the symbol 'Z'. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In\nan atom of neutral charge, the atomic number is also equal to the number of\nelectrons.\n\nThe atomic number, Z, should not be confused with the mass number, A, which is\nthe number of nucleons, the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus\nof an atom. The number of neutrons, N, is known as the neutron number of the\natom; thus, A = Z + N. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same\nmass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes), and the\nmass defect is usually very small compared to the mass, the atomic mass of an\natom is roughly equal to A.\n\nAtoms having the same atomic number Z but different neutron number N, and hence\ndifferent atomic mass, are known as isotopes. Most naturally occurring elements\nexist as a mixture of isotopes, and the average atomic mass of this mixture\ndetermines the element's atomic weight.\n\nThe conventional symbol Z comes from the German word meaning\nnumber/numeral/figure, which prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from\nchemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the\nperiodic table. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z\nnumber was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did\nthe word and its English equivalent atomic number come into common use.\n","linknr":259,"url":"Atomic_number","recorded":1362477454,"links":115,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties","Nuclear physics"],"headings":["History","Chemical properties","New elements","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Atomic_number_depiction.jpg/300px-Atomic_number_depiction.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Henry_Moseley.jpg/120px-Henry_Moseley.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemistry","Physics","Proton","Atomic_nucleus","Atom","Charge_number","Chemical_element","Electric_charge","Electron","Mass_number","Nucleon","Neutron","Neutron_number","Negligible","Atomic_mass","Isotope","Atomic_weight","German_language","Periodic_table","Periodic_table","Dmitri_Mendeleev","Atomic_weight","Tellurium","Iodine","Lanthanide","Lutetium","Hafnium","Ernest_Rutherford","Rutherford_model","Antonius_van_den_Broek","Henry_Moseley","Bohr_model","X-ray_tube","Moseley's_law","Electric_charge","Lanthanide","Lanthanum","Lutetium","German_language","Electron_configuration","Quantum_mechanics","Electron_shell","Valence_shell","Chemical_bonding","Half-life","Island_of_stability","History_of_the_periodic_table","Effective_atomic_number","Atomic_theory","Prout's_hypothesis"]}
