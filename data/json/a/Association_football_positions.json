{"cursor":"47593","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn the sport of '[[association football]]', each of the eleven players on a team\nis assigned to a particular position on the field of play. A team is made up of\none goalkeeper and ten outfield players who fill various defensive, midfield and\nattacking positions depending on the formation deployed. These positions\ndescribe both the player's main role and their area of operation on the pitch.\n\nIn the early development of the game outfield players were known simply as\n'forwards', 'half-backs' and 'three-quarter-back' depending on how far up the\npitch they played. In the latter part of the 19th century the 2â3â5 formation\nbecame widely used and the position names became more refined to reflect this.\nIn defence there were full-backs, known as the 'left-back' and 'right-back', in\nmidfield, 'left-half', 'centre-half' and 'right-half' and for the forward line\nthere were 'outside-left' (or left wing), 'inside-left', 'centre-forward', 'inside-\nright' and 'outside-right' (or right wing). As the game has evolved, tactics and\nteam formations have changed and so many of the names of the positions have\nchanged to reflect their duties in the modern game (though some old familiar\nones remain). The term \"half-back\" fell out of use by the early 1970s and\n\"midfield\" was used in naming the positions that play around the middle third as\nin 'centre midfield' and 'wide midfield'. The 'centre midfield' position has\nevolved further with the 'attacking midfield' and 'defensive midfield' biased\nvariants being recognised in their own right.\n\nThe fluid nature of the modern game means that positions in football are not as\nformally defined as in sports such as rugby or American football. Even so, most\nplayers will play in a limited range of positions throughout their career, as\neach position requires a particular set of skills and physical attributes.\nFootballers who are able to play comfortably in a number of positions are\nreferred to as \"utility players\".

This tactic required players who were extremely versatile, such as\nJohan Cruyff, who could play every position on the pitch apart from goalkeeper.-\n[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/football/features/newsid_3301000-\n/3301407.stm The total footballer], BBC Sport Academy, Accessed 5
