It\nwas among the early selective fire infantry rifles (capable of both single and\nfull-automatic fire) formally adopted for military service.\n\nThe designer, Sergei Simonov, began his work with a gas-operated self-loading\nrifle in 1930. The first prototype was ready in 1931 and appeared promising, and\nthree years later a trial batch of an improved design was made. In 1935, a\ncompetition between Simonov's design and a rifle made by Fedor Tokarev was held.\nThe Simonov rifle emerged as a winner and was accepted into service as the AVS-\n36. The AVS-36 was a gas-operated rifle with a short piston stroke and vertical\nsliding locking block. It was capable of both automatic and semi-automatic fire.\nThe barrel was equipped with a large muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Ammunition\nwas in a detachable magazine holding 15 rounds. A knife bayonet was issued with\nthe rifle. A sniper version was produced in small amounts with a PE scope. The\nAVS-36 was first seen in public in the 1938 May Day parade in Moscow, when it\nwas displayed by the marching 1st Rifle Division. The American public became\naware when it was covered in an August 1942 issue of the American [[Infantry\nJournal]], in an article by John Garrett Underhill, Jr.\n\nOnce in service, it quickly became apparent that the AVS was not a\nsatisfactory design; the operating mechanism was overly complicated, and the\nproblem was made worse by the rifle's construction which let dirt get inside\nthe weapon. The rifle was also particular about ammunition quality. The muzzle\nbrake design proved to be a failure â€” the rifle was nearly\nuncontrollable in automatic fire. Some of the problems were traced to the\nmagazine, which was deemed too long. Production of the AVS-36 was terminated\nin 1938, and a new design competition was held to which Simonov and Tokarev\nsubmitted their improved designs.\n\nIn 1938 Tokarev's SVT-38 was also adopted for service. In 1939 a politicized\ndispute erupted within the Soviet elite as to which design, that of Simonov or\nthat of Tokarev, should prevail. Simonov's rifle was lighter and contained fewer\nparts, while Tokarev's rifle was considered sturdier, although this mainly due\nto firing pin breakages on Simonov's rifle. Both guns had their supporters and\ndetractors among the Politburo. Stalin ultimately sided with Tokarev, with whom\nhe had a good personal relationship. By a decision of the Defense Committee\ndated 17 July 1939, mass production was to concentrate on the SVT-38.\n\n M/91-30, Mosin-Nagant M/38 Carbine, Mosin-Nagant M91 dragoon Rifle, AVS-36 and\n   the SVT-38]] Official Soviet production breakdown figures are: 106 made in\n   1934, 286 in 1935, 10,280 made in 1937, 24,401 in 1938, with an estimated\n   total of 65,800 AVS-36s manufactured until production stopped in 1940 (exact\n   production figures for some years, like 1936 or 1939, is not reported).\n\nThe rifle first saw service in the Battle of Halhin Gol, and later in the\nWinter War, but did not perform well. Some of the problems were caused by\nincorrect maintenance; many rifles went into combat without having been cleaned\nof their storage grease, which then \"froze\" solid. About 300 AVS-36 exemplars\nwere captured by the Finns; some were used\nby their new owners. The SVT-38s and LS-26s\nused on the Finnish side suffered from similar problems. After a large amount\nof the more serviceable SVTs were captured, the AVS-36s were largely withdrawn\nfrom service. In the Soviet Union, the AVS was quickly marginalized and\napparently withdrawn from service during 1941, though it saw brief service\nduring World War II. Some reports claim that remaining AVSs were mostly\nscrapped. Today, the AVS-36 is a rare collectors item; most of the remaining\nrifles in existence are in Finland.\n\nSimonov would later design an anti-tank rifle, the PTRS-41, and the SKS carbine,\nwhich employed simpler tilting bolt operation.\n","linknr":224,"url":"AVS-36","recorded":1375090770,"links":["/w/index.php?title=AVS-36&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=AVS-36&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AVS-36&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:AVS-36_-_Ryssland_-_AM.123596.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/AVS-36_-_Ryssland_-_AM.123596.jpg/300px-AVS-36_-_Ryssland_-_AM.123596.jpg","/wiki/Automatic_rifle","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Sergei_Gavrilovich_Simonov","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Gun_barrel","/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)","/wiki/7.62x54mmR","/wiki/Firearm_action","/wiki/Gas-operated_reloading","/wiki/Rate_of_fire","/wiki/Muzzle_velocity","/wiki/File:AVS_36.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/AVS_36.JPG/300px-AVS_36.JPG","/wiki/File:AVS_36.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Russian_language","/wiki/Automatic_rifle","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Selective_fire","/wiki/Sergei_Gavrilovich_Simonov","/wiki/Fedor_Tokarev","/wiki/Muzzle_brake","/wiki/Magazine_(firearms)","/wiki/Bayonet","/wiki/Sniper","/wiki/Moscow","/wiki/1st_Guards_Motor_Rifle_Division","/w/index.php?title=Infantry_Journal&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Garrett_Underhill,_Jr.","#cite_note-Bolotin1995-2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/SVT-38","/wiki/Politburo","#cite_note-3","/wiki/File:Red_army_World_War_II_rifles.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Red_army_World_War_II_rifles.JPG/220px-Red_army_World_War_II_rifles.JPG","/wiki/File:Red_army_World_War_II_rifles.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Mosin-Nagant","/wiki/Mosin-Nagant","/wiki/Mosin-Nagant","/wiki/SVT-38","#cite_note-Bolotin1995-2","/wiki/Battle_of_Halhin_Gol","/wiki/Winter_War","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-JowettRuggeri2012-4","#cite_note-Irincheev2012-5","/wiki/SVT-38","/wiki/LS-26","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/Finland","/wiki/PTRS-41","/wiki/SKS","/w/index.php?title=AVS-36&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/FG_42","/wiki/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle","/wiki/M1941_Johnson_machine_gun","/wiki/List_of_Russian_weaponry","/w/index.php?title=AVS-36&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.jaegerplatoon.net/RIFLES4.htm","#cite_ref-Bolotin1995_2-0","#cite_ref-Bolotin1995_2-1","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9519718419","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9519718419","#cite_ref-JowettRuggeri2012_4-0","http://books.google.com/books?id=2k8n063soJcC&pg=PA48","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-78200-125-6","#cite_ref-Irincheev2012_5-0","http://books.google.com/books?id=Seki32T1LAMC&pg=PA40-IA10","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-8117-1088-6","/w/index.php?title=AVS-36&action=edit&section=3","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:AVS-36","http://world.guns.ru/rifle/rfl16-e.htm","/wiki/Template:WWIIUSSRInfWeapons","/wiki/Template_talk:WWIIUSSRInfWeapons","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WWIIUSSRInfWeapons&action=edit","/wiki/World_War_II","/wiki/TT_pistol","/wiki/Nagant_M1895","/wiki/Mauser_C96","/wiki/Rifle","/wiki/Carbine","/wiki/SVT-40","/wiki/Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant","/wiki/SKS","/wiki/Submachine_gun","/wiki/PPD-40","/wiki/PPSh-41","/wiki/PPS_submachine_gun","/wiki/Hand_grenade","/wiki/F1_grenade_(Russia)","/wiki/RGD-33_grenade","/wiki/RG-41","/wiki/RG-42","/wiki/Model_1914_grenade","/wiki/RPG-40","/wiki/RPG-43","/wiki/RPG-6","/wiki/Machine_gun","/wiki/Russian_M1910_Maxim","/wiki/DS-39","/wiki/Degtyaryov_machine_gun","/wiki/SG-43_Goryunov","/wiki/Maxim-Tokarev","/wiki/DShK","/wiki/PTRD","/wiki/PTRS-41","/wiki/PV-1_machine_gun","/wiki/ROKS_flamethrowers","/wiki/7.62%C3%9725mm_T
