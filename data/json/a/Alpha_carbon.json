By extension, the second\n carbon is the 'beta carbon', and so on.\n\nThis nomenclature can also be applied to the hydrogen atoms attached to the\ncarbons. A hydrogen attached to an alpha carbon is called an 'alpha-hydrogen'\n(Î±-hydrogen), a hydrogen on the beta-carbon is a 'beta-hydrogen', and so on.\n\nThis naming standard is sometimes considered to be not in compliance with IUPAC\nnomenclature (which encourages that carbons be identified by number, not by\nGreek letter), but it nonetheless remains very popular, in particular because it\nis useful in identifying the relative location of carbons to other functional\ngroups (a carbonyl in the example on the right).\n\nOrganic molecules with more than one functional group can be a source of\nconfusion. Generally the functional group responsible for the name or type of\nthe molecule is the \"reference\" group for purposes of carbon naming. For\nexample, the molecules nitrostyrene and phenethylamine are very similar; the\nformer can even be reduced into the latter. However, nitrostyrene's Î±-carbon is\nadjacent to the styrene group; in phenethylamine this same carbon is the Î²-\ncarbon, as phenethylamine (being an amine rather than a styrene) counts its\natoms from the opposite \"end\" of the molecule. {{Cite web\n|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/adsarchive/nomenclature.htm\n|title=Nomeclature |work=Ask Dr. Shulgin Online |accessdate=August 5,\n2010}}\n","linknr":118,"url":"Alpha_carbon","recorded":1362371322,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic chemistry"],"headings":["Examples","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Alpha_and_beta_positions_of_benzylacetone-structure.svg/220px-Alpha_and_beta_positions_of_benzylacetone-structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_chemistry","Functional_group","IUPAC_nomenclature","Carbonyl","Nitrostyrene","Phenethylamine","Redox","Styrene","Protein","Amino_acid","Stereogenic","Glycine","Stereocenter","Protein_folding","Ångström","Picometer","Enolate","Carbonyl","Haloalkane","Silyl_enol_ether"]}
