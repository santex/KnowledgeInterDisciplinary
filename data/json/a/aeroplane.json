Airplanes come in a\nvariety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses\nfor airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military,\nand research.\n\nMost airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed\nto be remotely or computer-controlled.\n",
