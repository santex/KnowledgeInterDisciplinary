These rigid social designators remain fixed throughout an\nindividual's life and are inseparable from the positive or negative stereotypes\nthat are linked with one's ascribed statuses.\n\nThe practice of assigning such statuses to individuals exists cross-culturally\nwithin all societies and are based on gender, race, family origins, and ethnic\nbackgrounds. For example, a person born into a wealthy family has a high\nascribed status based solely on the social networks and economic advantages that\none gains from being born into a family with more resources than others.\n\nIn contrast, an achieved status is a social position a person takes on\nvoluntarily that reflects both personal ability and merit. An individual's\noccupation tends to fall under the category of an achieved status; for example,\na teacher or a firefighter.\n\nIndividuals have control over their achieved statuses insofar as there are no\nrestrictions that are associated with their ascribed statuses that could\npotentially hinder their social growth. Ascribed status plays an important role\nin societies because it can provide the members with a defined and unified\nidentity. No matter where an individual's ascribed status may place him or her\nin the social hierarchy each has a set of roles and expectations that are\ndirectly linked to each ascribed status and thus, provides a social identity.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Ascribed_status","recorded":1362676786,"links":24,"instances":["classification_of_human_beings"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Socioeconomics","Social psychology","Social philosophy","Social status","Sociology index"],"headings":["Factors","Reversible and irreversible ascribed status","Low self-esteem and ascribed status","Minorities and status inconsistency","Types of statuses in upper class population","Religion","Caste system","See also","References","Citations"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg/40px-Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["race","classification_of_human_beings"]],"members":["race"],"related":["Social_status","Social_networks","Achieved_status","Ageing","Age_stratification","Kinship","Sex","Human_physical_appearance","Race_(classification_of_human_beings)","Social_group","Caste","Ralph_Linton","Wealth","Christianity","Hinduism","Islam","India","Caste_system","Brahmins","Kshatriyas","Vaishyas","Shudra","Dalit","Achieved_status","Master_status","Social_status"]}
