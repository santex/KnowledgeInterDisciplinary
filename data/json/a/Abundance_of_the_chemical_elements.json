{"cursor":"30566","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'abundance' of a chemical element measures how relatively common (or rare)\nthe element is, or how much of the element is present in a given environment by\ncomparison to all other elements. Abundance may be variously measured by the mass-\nfraction (the same as weight fraction), or mole-fraction (fraction of atoms by\nnumerical count, or sometimes fraction of molecules in gases), or by volume-\nfraction. Measurement by volume-fraction is a common abundance measure in mixed\ngases such as planetary atmospheres, and is close to molecular mole-fraction for\nideal gas mixtures (i.e., gas mixtures at relatively low densities and\npressures).\n\nFor example, the mass-fraction abundance of oxygen in water is about 89%,\nbecause that is the fraction of water's mass which is oxygen. However, the mole-\nfraction abundance of oxygen in water is only 33% because only 1 atom of 3 in\nwater is an oxygen atom. In the universe as a whole, and in the atmospheres of\ngas-giant planets such as Jupiter, the mass-fraction abundances of hydrogen and\nhelium are about 74% and 23â25% respectively, while the (atomic) mole-fractions\nof these elements are closer to 92% and 8%. However, since hydrogen is diatomic\nwhile helium is not, in the conditions of Jupiter's outer atmosphere, the\nmolecular mole-fraction (fraction of total gas molecules, or fraction of\natmosphere by volume) of hydrogen in the outer atmosphere of Jupiter is about\n86%, and for helium, 13%.\n\nMost abundances in this article are given as mass-fraction abundances.\n","linknr":535,"url":"Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements","recorded":1362477471,"links":31,"instances":["physics","publisher","data_page","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://quake.mit.edu/hilstgroup/CoreMantle/EarthCompo.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060901133923/http://www.astro.wesleyan.edu/~bill/courses/astr231/wes_only/element_abundances.pdf"],"categories":["Astrochemistry","Properties of chemical elements|"],"headings":["Abundance of elements in the Universe","Abundance of elements in the Earth","Human body elemental abundance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/080998_Universe_Content_240.jpg/200px-080998_Universe_Content_240.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/SolarSystemAbundances.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Spacer.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Elemental_abundances.svg/400px-Elemental_abundances.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mass_fraction","chemistry"],["plasma","physics"],["anchor","publisher"],["abundances_of_the_elements","data_page"]],"members":["plasma","anchor","abundances_of_the_elements","mass_fraction"],"related":["Chemical_element","Mass_fraction_(chemistry)","Mole_fraction","Ideal_gas","Oxygen","Water","Atom","Universe","Atmosphere","Gas_giant","Jupiter","Hydrogen","Helium","Diatomic","Atmosphere_of_Jupiter","Milky_Way_Galaxy","Atomic_Number","Hydrogen","Helium","Oxygen","Carbon","Neon","Iron","Nitrogen","Silicon","Magnesium","Sulfur","Baryon","Proton","Neutron","Electron","Observational_cosmology","Baryon","Matter","Star","Planets","Life","Dark_energy","Dark_matter","Scientific_theory","Deductive_reasoning","Ions","Plasma_(physics)","White_dwarf","Neutron_star","Hydrogen","Universe","Helium","Atomic_number","Oxygen","Lambda-CDM_model","Big_Bang","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Star","Milky_Way_galaxy","Astronomy","Lithium","Star","Metallicity","Galaxy","Anchor_(publisher)","Visible_universe","Solar_System","Big_Bang","Nucleosynthesis","Supernova","Cosmic_ray","Supernova","Solar_System","Isotope","Atomic_Mass","Hydrogen-1","Helium-4","Oxygen-16","Carbon-12","Nitrogen-14","Neon-20","Silicon-28","Magnesium-24","Iron-56","Sulfur-32","Helium-3","Hydrogen-2","Neon-22","Magnesium-26","Carbon-13","Magnesium-25","Aluminum-27","Argon-36","Calcium-40","Sodium-23","Iron-54","Silicon-29","Nickel-58","Silicon-30","Iron-57","Big_Bang","Nucleosynthesis","Nuclear_fusion","Carbon_burning","Binding_energy","Pauli_Exclusion_Principle","Semi-empirical_mass_formula","Earth","Formation_and_evolution_of_the_solar_system","History_of_Earth","Iron","Oxygen","Silicon","Magnesium","Sulfur","Nickel","Calcium","Aluminium","Mass_segregation","Meteoroid","Rare_earth_element","Precious_metal","Platinum_group","Gold","Rhenium","Tellurium","Technetium","Promethium","Nuclear_fission","Radioactive_decay","Uranium","Thorium","Plutonium","Cosmic_ray","Noble_gas","Polonium","Astatine","Francium","Radium","Actinium","Protactinium","Neptunium","Plutonium","Americium","Curium","Berkelium","Californium","Radioactive_decay","Oxygen","Silicon","Silicate_mineral","Rare_earth_element","Thulium","Lutetium","Lanthanum","Cerium","Praseodymium","Neodymium","Oxygen","Hydrogen","Chlorine","Sodium","Magnesium","Sulfur","Calcium","Potassium","Bromine","Carbon","Earth's_atmosphere","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Argon","Oxygen","Carbon","Hydrogen","Nitrogen","Calcium","Phosphorus","Potassium","Sulfur","Chlorine","Sodium","Magnesium","Iron","Cobalt","Copper","Zinc","Iodine","Selenium","Trace_element","Boron","Silicon","Abundances_of_the_elements_(data_page)","Natural_abundance","Primordial_nuclide"]}
