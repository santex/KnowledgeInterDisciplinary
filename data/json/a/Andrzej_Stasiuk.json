He is best known for his travel literature\nand essays that describe the reality of Eastern Europe and its relationship\nwith the West.\n\nAfter being dismissed from secondary school, Stasiuk drifted aimlessly, became\nactive in the Polish pacifist movement and spent one and a half years in\nprison for deserting the army - as legend has it, in a tank. His experiences\nin prison provided him with the material for the stories in his literary debut\nin 1992. Entitled Mury Hebronu (\"The Walls of Hebron\"), it instantly\nestablished him as a premier literary talent. After a collection of \"Love and\nnon-love poems\" (Wiersze miÅosne i nie, 1994), Stasiuk's bestselling first full-\nlength novel BiaÅy kruk (English translation as White Raven in 2000) appeared\nin 1995 and consolidated his position among the most successful authors in post-\ncommunist Poland.\n\nLong before his literary breakthrough, in 1986, Stasiuk had left his native\nWarsaw and withdrew to the seclusion of the small hamlet of Czarne in the\nBeskids, a secluded part of the Carpathian mountain range in the south of\nPoland. Outside writing, he spends his time breeding sheep. Together with his\nwife, he also runs his own tiny but, by now, prestigious publishing business\nWydawnictwo Czarne, named after its seat. Apart from his own books, Czarne\nalso publishes other East European authors. Czarne also re-published works by\nthe Ã©migrÃ© Polish author Zygmunt Haupt, thus initiating Haupt's rediscovery\nin Poland.\n\nWhile \"White Raven\" had a straight adventure plot, Stasiuk's subsequent writing\nhas become increasingly impressionistic and concentrated on atmospheric\ndescriptions of his adopted mental home, the provincial south-east of Poland and\nEurope, and the lives of its inhabitants. [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician]]\nTales, one of several works available in English (among the others are White\nRaven, Nine, \"Dukla,\" \"Fado,\" and \"On the Road to Babadag\") conveys a good\nimpression of the specific style developed by Stasiuk. A similar text is \"Dukla\"\n(1997), named after a small town near his home. \"Dukla\" achieved Stasiuk's\nbreakthrough in Germany and helped built him the most appreciative reader-base\noutside Poland, although a number of Stasiuk's books have been translated into\nseveral other languages.\n\nIn an interview, Stasiuk confessed his preoccupation with this area and a lack\nof interest in western Europe: \"I haven't been to France or Spain and Iâve never\nthought about going there. I am simply interested in our part of the world, this\ncentral and eastern reality. My God, what would I be doing in France...\" \n\nStasiuk himself cites Marek HÅasko as a major influence; critics have compared\nhis style of stream of consciousness travel literature to that of Jack Kerouac.\nStasiuk admitted that he \"always wanted to write a Slavonic â[[On the Road]]â\nand place it in a quite geographically limited and historically complicated\nspace\"[http://www.polishwriting.net/index.php?id=103]. Stasiuk's travelogue\nJadÄc do Babadag (\"Travelling to Babadag\"), describes a journey from the Baltic\nSea down to Albania, and arguably comes close to this ideal. In Stasiuk's own\nwords, \"[t]here is no individual, human story in this book [...]. I wanted\nrather to write about geography, landscape, about the influence of material\nreality on the mind\". JadÄc do Babadag received\nthe NIKE for the best Polish book of 2000.\n\nA certain exception to the stylistic preferences in Stasiuk's more recent work\nis the 1998 novel DziewiÄÄ (\"Nine\"), which is set in Warsaw and records the\nchanges affecting urban Polish society after the collapse of communism.\n\nApart from (semi-) fictional writing, Stasiuk also tried his hand at literary\ncriticism (in Tekturowy samolot/\"Cardboard Aeroplane\", 2000) and quasi-political\nessayism on the notion of Central Europe (together with the Ukrainian writer\nYuri Andrukhovych) in Moja Europa. Dwa eseje o Europie zwanej ÅrodkowÄ (\"My\nEurope: Two essays on the Europe called 'Central'\"). Stasiuk frequently\ncontributes articles to Polish and German papers.\n\nStasiuk's least typical work is Noc (\"Night\"), subtitled \"A Slavo-Germanic\nmedical tragifarce\", a stageplay commissioned by the Schauspielhaus of\nDÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, for a theatre festival to celebrate the enlargement of the\nEuropean Union in 2004. In the guise of a grotesque crime story, Stasiuk\npresents two imaginary nations, symbolising Eastern and Western Europe and\neasily recognisable as Poles and Germans, who are entangled in an adversarial\nbut at the same time strangely symbiotic relationship.\n\nIn 2007, Stasiuk continued to deal with the Polish-German topic in a travelogue\ntitled Dojczland, in which he described his impressions of Germany from his\nreading tours there.\n\nIn an interview in 2007, Stasiuk commented on his fascination with the topic as\nfollows: }}\n\nIn an interview with [[Wprost]] at the close of 2011, he again discussed Europe\nand, in particular, Germany.\n\n{{quote|[The word Germany] has a heavy legacy, beginning with [its] etymology\nwhich means mute [in Polish], someone with which you cannot communicate because\nof his incomprehensible language. . . . They have really tried\n[to learn from the past] and are still trying, and I say this without irony and\nwith respect, [but] when there is a group, someone has to dominate, that's how\nit is. Of course, the Poles would rather play this role but . . .\nGermany will dominate. . . . [The Germans] need to be the best at\neverything, and what is needed is to put them on the rails to good leadership.\nIn other words, they need, how shall I put it, a bit of\nmonitoring. . . .\n\nI like Germany by contrast, it's a world that is the opposite of\nours. . . . I don't admire Germany. I just like to go there from\ntime to time to see how matter is tamed and organised. . . .\n\n'Polishness' must also certainly be a sort of feeling of\nsuperiority. . . . Unjustified, of course. But\nstill. . . . Without danger, without troubles, Poland is less\nalive[;] whenever nationalism comes knocking on the door, it feels better right\naway, it perks up and gets its strength back. So long live German nationalism.\nWhich doesn't mean, does it, that we must not remain vigilant.
