{"cursor":"27455","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nWhile the phrase 'age of consent' rarely appears in legal statutes, when used in relation to sexual activity, the age of\nconsent is the minimum age at which a person is considered to be legally\ncompetent to consent to sexual acts. It should not be confused with the age of\nmajority, age of criminal responsibility, the marriageable age, the voting age,\nthe drinking age, driving age, or other purposes. Laws vary widely, and while\nmost jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18, ages of consent\nas low as 12 and as high as 21 exist.\n\nThe age of consent varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The relevant age may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the\nactors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a position of trust. Some\njurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with\neach other, rather than a single age. Charges resulting from a breach of these\nlaws may range from a misdemeanor such as corruption of a minor, to what is\npopularly called [[statutory rape]] (which is considered equivalent to rape,\nboth in severity and sentencing).\n\nThere are many \"gray areas\" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and\nuntried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal\nattitudes, and others due to conflicts between federal and state laws. These\nfactors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of\nhighly charged debates.\n","linknr":620,"url":"Age_of_consent","recorded":1362486291,"links":52,"instances":["jurist","canon_law","uk"],"pdf":["http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf","http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/CsaBrunei.pdf","http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/CsaBrunei.pdf","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/pdf/ukpga_20030042_en.pdf"],"categories":["Age and society","Ageism","Legal fictions","Sex laws","Sexuality and age","Statutory law","Minimum ages"],"headings":["History and social attitudes","Law","Other concerns","Initiatives to change the age of consent","By country or region","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Age_of_Consent_-_Global.svg/300px-Age_of_Consent_-_Global.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Sexual_orientation_-_4_symbols.svg/32px-Sexual_orientation_-_4_symbols.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Scale_of_justice_2_new.jpeg/28px-Scale_of_justice_2_new.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gratian","jurist"],["age_of_reason","canon_law"],["age_of_consent_manifestations","uk"]],"members":["gratian","age_of_reason","age_of_consent_manifestations"],"related":["Statute","Human_sexual_activity","Age_of_majority","Defense_of_infancy","Marriageable_age","Position_of_trust","Misdemeanor","Menstruation","Gratian_(jurist)","Canon_law","Medieval","Dower","Western_world","Criminal_offense","United_Kingdom","Puberty","Nayarit","Quer√©taro","Kuwait","Sexual_intercourse","England_and_Wales","Due_diligence","Brunei","Canada","Finland","The_Bahamas","Bermuda","Chile","Greece","Paraguay","Suriname","Homosexuality","Canada","Australia","Queensland","Anal_sex","Alberta","Ontario","Quebec","Indonesia","Papua_New_Guinea","Palestinian_National_Authority","Sexual_intercourse","Yemen","Pornography","Ages_of_consent_in_Africa","Ages_of_consent_in_Asia","Ages_of_consent_in_Oceania","Ages_of_consent_in_Europe","Ages_of_consent_in_North_America","Ages_of_consent_in_South_America","Antarctica","Antarctic_Treaty","1891_Age_of_Consent_Act","Adult_film_industry_regulations","Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships","Age_of_accountability","Age_of_reason_(canon_law)","Age_of_consent_manifestations_(UK)","Child_sexual_abuse","Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child","Emancipation_of_minors","French_petitions_against_age_of_consent_laws","Minors_and_abortion","Mature_minor_doctrine","Sexual_Morality_and_the_Law","Sodomy_law","The_Maiden_Tribute_of_Modern_Babylon"]}
