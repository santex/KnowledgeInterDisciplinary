{"cursor":"5384","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the English language, imagination implies a visual mode. Since there was no\nword similar to imagination for the auditory mode, music education researcher\nEdwin Gordon coined the word 'audiation' in 1975. Audiation is to sound in the\nsame way that imagination is to images. For example, audiation may involve\nmentally hearing and comprehending music, even when no physical sound is\npresent. It is a cognitive process by which the brain gives meaning to musical\nsounds. In essence, audiation of music is analogous to thinking in a language.\nThe term audiation should not be confused with audition, the mere perception of\nsound. Audiation is also more than just a musical form of auditory imagery.\nDeveloped audiation includes the necessary understanding of music to enable the\nconscious prediction of patterns in unfamiliar music and sound.\n\nAccording to Gordon: Although music is not a language, the process\nis the same for audiating and giving meaning to music as for thinking and giving\nmeaning to speech. When you are listening to speech, you are giving meaning to\nwhat was just said by recalling and making connections with what you have heard\non earlier occasions. At the same time, you are anticipating or predicting what\nyou will be hearing next, based on your experience and understanding. Similarly,\nwhen you are listening to music, you are giving meaning to what you just heard\nby recalling what you have heard on earlier occasions. At the same time, you are\nanticipating or predicting what you are hearing next, based on your musical\nachievement. In other words, when you are audiating as you are listening to\nmusic, you are summarizing and generalizing from the specific music patterns you\nhave just heard as a way to anticipate or predict what will follow. Every action\nbecomes an interaction. What you are audiating depends on what you have already\naudiated. As audiation develops, the broader and deeper it becomes and thus the\nmore it is able to reflect on itself. Members of an audience who are not\naudiating usually do not know when a piece of unfamiliar, or even familiar,\nmusic is nearing its end. They may applaud at any time, or not at all, unless\nthey receive clues from others in the audience who are audiating. Through the\nprocess of audiation, we sing and move in our minds, without ever having to sing\nand move physically. Learning Sequences in Music:\nSkill, Content, and Patterns (1997) by Edwin E.
