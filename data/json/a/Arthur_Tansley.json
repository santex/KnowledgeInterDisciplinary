Educated at University College London and\nTrinity College, Cambridge, Tansley taught at these institutions and at Oxford,\nwhere he served as Sherardian Professor of Botany until his retirement in 1937.\nHe founded the [[New Phytologist]] in 1902 and served as its editor until\n1931. Tansley was a pioneer of the science of ecology in\nBritain, being heavily influenced by the work of Danish botanist Eugenius\nWarming, and introduced the concept of the ecosystem\ninto biology. Tansley was a founding member of the\nfirst professional society of ecologists, the Central Committee for the Survey\nand Study of British Vegetation, which later organised the British Ecological\nSociety, and served as its first president and founding editor of the [[Journal\nof Ecology]]. Tansley also served as\nthe first chairman of the British Nature Conservancy.\nTansley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1915, and was knighted in\n1950. The New Phytologist publishes regular Tansley\nReviews and awards a Tansley Medal, both named in his honour.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Arthur_Tansley","recorded":1362505504,"links":33,"instances":["ecology","ecology","botanist","uk"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English ecologists","Fellows of the Royal Society","1871 births","1955 deaths","English botanists","Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford","Analysands of Sigmund Freud"],"headings":["Early life and education","Professional career","Major contributions","Personal life","Notes","Other sources","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature_conservancy","uk"],["william_gardner_smith","botanist"],["community","ecology"],["association","ecology"],["nature_conservancy","uk"]],"members":["community","association","william_gardner_smith","nature_conservancy"],"related":["London","Grantchester","Alexander_Watt","New_Phytologist","British_Ecological_Society","Ecosystem","Eugenius_Warming","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","England","Botanist","Ecology","University_College_London","Trinity_College,_Cambridge","University_of_Oxford","Eugenius_Warming","Ecosystem","British_Ecological_Society","Nature_Conservancy_(UK)","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","London","Working_Men's_College","Highgate_School","Ray_Lankester","Francis_Wall_Oliver","Tripos","University_of_Cambridge","Vienna","Sigmund_Freud","Palaeobotany","William_Gardner_Smith_(botanist)","Charles_Edward_Moss","Thomas_Woodhead","International_Phytogeographic_Excursion","Carl_Schröter","Henry_Chandler_Cowles","Frederic_Clements","Carl_Axel_Magnus_Lindman","Carl_Georg_Oscar_Drude","Karl_Otto_Robert_Peter_Paul_Graebner","British_Ecological_Society","Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","British_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science","Imperial_Botanical_Congress","William_Skinner_Cooper","Ecosystem","Arthur_Roy_Clapham","Community_(ecology)","Association_(ecology)","Superorganism","Thomas_Ford_Chipp","Linnean_Medal","Habitat_conservation","Nature_reserve","Nature_Conservancy_(UK)","Psychology","Bernard_Hart","Psychoanalysis","Carl_Jung","London","Grantchester"]}
