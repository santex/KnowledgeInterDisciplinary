ACTIVE is member of the Youth Forum Jeunesse and\ncooperates with IOGT International.\n\nThe main aim of Active is peace and tolerance in the world. Active considers\nalcohol and other drugs one of the main reasons for violence and conflicts in\ntoday's world and therefore members of Active promote a drug-free lifestyle by\ntheir own abstinence--to prove that having fun, making friends, and being free\nis possible without getting addicted and without any risk of hurting somebody or\nbeing hurt.\n\nActive provides the space for self-realisation, for making new contacts, for\nexchange projects, education and for being active on political level in order to\nmake a difference. Active is a support for each national organisation in\nreaching the main common goal--peace and human dignity.\n","linknr":153,"url":"ACTIVE","recorded":1362477146,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["International organizations of Europe","Youth councils","Temperance organizations","Alcohol in Europe"],"headings":["Activities","Member organisations","ACTIVE Board 2012-2014","History","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Europe","EGTYF","Non-governmental_organisation","Umbrella_organisation","Temperance_movement","European_Youth_Forum","IOGT_International","Alcohol","Psychoactive_drug","Violence","Abstinence","Albania","Belarus","Bosnia_and_Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Croatia","Estonia","Faroe_Islands","Finland","Germany","Iceland","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Norway","Republic_of_Macedonia","Russia","Slovak_Republic","Serbia","Sweden","Switzerland","Transnistria","Moldova","Ukraine","England_and_Wales","Hege_Sørvig","Hege_Sørvig","Åsa_Hagelstedt"]}
