{"cursor":"3446","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" departure tax stamp applied to a boarding pass ]] An 'airport improvement fee'\n or 'embarkation fee' or 'airport tax' or 'service charge' or 'service fee' is\n an additional fee charged to departing and connecting passengers at an airport.\n It is levied by government or an airport management corporation and the\n proceeds are usually intended for funding of major airport improvements or\n expansion or airport service. Some airports do not levy these fees on\n connecting passengers who do not leave the airport or whose connecting flight\n is within a specific timeframe after they arrive.\n\nIn the United States, the federal passenger facility charge (PFC) program allows\nthe collection of PFC fees up to $4.50 for every enplaned passenger at\ncommercial airports controlled by public agencies. Airports use these fees to\nfund FAA-approved projects that enhance safety, security, or capacity; reduce\nnoise; or increase air carrier competition. Federal law limits use of PFC funds\nstrictly to the above categories. [http://www.faa.gov/airports/pfc/\nPassenger Facility Charge (PFC)]\n\nDepending on the location, the airport improvement fee is included in the cost\nof traveller's airline ticket, in which case the airline will forward the fee to\nproper agency. However, in some locations the fee must be paid at the point of\nembarkation. This often creates difficulties for departing passengers who are\nunfamiliar with this type of procedure, or for departing international\npassengers who have already exchanged all their local currency. The amount\nvaries usually between US$10 and $30. In some instances, the fee continues to be\ncharged long after construction has been completed (i.e. Ottawa Macdonald-\nCartier International Airport). A legitimate reason for this is that the airport\nmust finance the cost of the improvement and then pays off these costs over an\nextended period of time.\n\nAirports currently collecting an explicit airport improvement fee include:\n* Jorge Chavez International Airport Lima, Peru\n* Ministro Pistarini International Airport (Ezeiza), Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* RamÃ³n Villeda Morales International Airport San Pedro Sula, Honduras\n* Ngurah Rai Airport (Denpasar), Bali, Indonesia\n* Indira Gandhi International Airport New Delhi, India\n* Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Jakarta, Indonesia\n* Carrasco International Airport, Montevideo, Uruguay\n* Norwich International Airport, Norwich, United Kingdom\n* Newquay Cornwall Airport, Newquay, United Kingdom\n* Ireland West Airport Knock, Knock, Republic of Ireland\n* Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Manila, Philippines\n* Almost all Canadian international airports\n* Almost all Brazilian airports administered by Infraero\n* All airports in China\n","linknr":107,"url":"Airport_Improvement_Fee","recorded":1362551675,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.travel-nation.co.uk/local_taxes.pdf"],"categories":["Civil aviation","Taxation"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/29/TS_boarding_pass_April_2000.jpg/220px-TS_boarding_pass_April_2000.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Tax_stamp","Ottawa_Macdonald-Cartier_International_Airport","Jorge_Chavez_International_Airport","Ministro_Pistarini_International_Airport","Ramón_Villeda_Morales_International_Airport","Ngurah_Rai_Airport","Indira_Gandhi_International_Airport","Soekarno-Hatta_International_Airport","Jakarta","Carrasco_International_Airport","Norwich_International_Airport","Norwich","Newquay_Cornwall_Airport","Newquay","Ireland_West_Airport_Knock","Knock","Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport","Manila","List_of_international_airports_in_Canada","Infraero","Air_Passenger_Duty","German_air_passenger_taxes","Air_Travel_Tax"]}
