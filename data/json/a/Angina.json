The\nmain cause of Angina pectoris is Coronary Artery Disease, due to atherosclerosis\nof the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the Latin angina\n(\"infection of the throat\") from the Greek á¼Î³ÏÏÎ½Î· ankhonÄ (\"strangling\"), and\nthe Latin pectus (\"chest\"), and can therefore be translated as \"a strangling\nfeeling in the chest\".\n\nThere is a weak relationship between severity of pain and degree of oxygen\ndeprivation in the heart muscle (i.e., there can be severe pain with little or\nno risk of a heart attack, and a heart attack can occur without pain). In some\ncases Angina can be extremely serious and has been known to cause death. People\nthat suffer from average to severe cases of Angina have an increased percentage\nof death before the age of 55, usually around 60%.\n\nWorsening (\"crescendo\") angina attacks, sudden-onset angina at rest, and angina\nlasting more than 15 minutes are symptoms of unstable angina (usually grouped\nwith similar conditions as the acute coronary syndrome). As these may herald\nmyocardial infarction (a heart attack), they require urgent medical attention\nand are generally treated as a presumed heart attack.\n","linknr":551,"url":"Angina","recorded":1362482090,"links":58,"instances":["psychological","pharmacology","anatomy","medicine"],"pdf":["http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf","http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf"],"categories":["Ischemic heart diseases"],"headings":["Classification","Signs and symptoms","Cause","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Treatment","Epidemiology","History","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lumen","anatomy"],["family_history","medicine"],["stress","psychological"],["glyceryl_trinitrate","pharmacology"],["glyceryl_trinitrate","pharmacology"]],"members":["stress","glyceryl_trinitrate","lumen","family_history"],"related":["Chest_pain","Ischemia","Myocardium","Coronary_circulation","Coronary_Artery_Disease","Atherosclerosis","Latin","Greek_language","Pain","Acute_coronary_syndrome","Myocardial_infarction","Claudication","Acute_coronary_syndrome","Atheroma","Lumen_(anatomy)","Epigastrium","Referred_pain","Dermatomes","Referred_pain","Precordial_catch_syndrome","Ischemia","Perfusion","Autonomic_nervous_system","Nausea","Vomiting","Pallor","Tobacco_smoking","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypercholesterolemia","Hypertension","Sedentary_lifestyle","Family_history_(medicine)","Prinzmetal's_angina","Dyslipidemia","Cardiovascular_disease","Body_mass_index","Stress_(psychological)","Polycythemia","Tobacco_smoking","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Stenosis","Embolism","Atherosclerosis","Stenosis","Vasospasm","Prinzmetal's_angina","Cardiac_syndrome_X","Blood","Anemia","Tobacco_smoking","Electrocardiogram","Cardiac_stress_test","Cardiac_stress_test","Asthma","Arthritis","Echocardiography","Coronary_catheterization","Angioplasty","Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery","Troponin","Glyceryl_trinitrate_(pharmacology)","Vasodilator","Beta-blocker","Calcium_channel_blocker","Sildenafil","Tadalafil","Vardenafil","Balloon_angioplasty","Catheter","Arterial_lumen","Stent","Coronary_bypass_surgery","Angioplasty","Myocardial_infarction","Death","Glyceryl_trinitrate_(pharmacology)","Calcium_channel_blocker","Nifedipine","Amlodipine","Isosorbide_mononitrate","Nicorandil","Ivabradine","ACE_inhibitor","Statins","Aspirin","Haemorrhagic_stroke","Hypercholesterolemia","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypertension","Smoking_cessation","Weight_loss","Nifedipine","Fatty_acid_oxidation_inhibitor","Mildronate","Angina","Myocardial_infarction","Mildronate","Fatty_acid","Oxidation","Glucose","Oxidation","Enzymes","Carnitine_biosynthesis","Gamma-butyrobetaine_dioxygenase","Mildronate","Carnitine_acetyltransferase","Third_World","Diseases_of_affluence","Tobacco_smoking","Obesity","The_China_Study","China","Bisphenol-A","Sushruta"]}
