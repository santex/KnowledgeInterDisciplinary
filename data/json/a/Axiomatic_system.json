{"cursor":"9458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, an 'axiomatic system' is any set of axioms from which some or\nall axioms can be used in conjunction to logically derive theorems. A\nmathematical theory consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived\ntheorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of\nformal system; usually though, the effort towards complete formalisation brings\ndiminishing returns in certainty, and a lack of readability for humans. A formal\ntheory typically means an axiomatic system, for example formulated within model\ntheory. A formal proof is a complete rendition of a mathematical proof within a\nformal system.\n","linknr":471,"url":"Axiomatic_system","recorded":1362552264,"links":28,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mathematical axioms|*","Conceptual systems","Formal systems","Methods of proof"],"headings":["Properties","Relative consistency","Models","Axiomatic method","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"]],"members":["ring","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Set_(mathematics)","Axiom","Logic","Theorem","Mathematical_theory","Formal_system","Model_theory","Formal_proof","Mathematical_proof","Contradiction","Set_(mathematics)","Consistency_proof","Isomorphism","Logicism","Principia_Mathematica","Alfred_North_Whitehead","Bertrand_Russell","Homological_algebra","Ring_(mathematics)","Commutative_ring","Emmy_Noether","Topological_spaces","Separation_axiom","Felix_Hausdorff","Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory","Naive_set_theory","Continuum_hypothesis","Euclid","Alexandria","Euclidean_geometry","Number_theory","Non-Euclidean_geometry","Real_analysis","Georg_Cantor","Set_theory","Gottlob_Frege","David_Hilbert","Group_theory","Inverse_element","Transformation_group","Recursive_set","Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems","Natural_number","Topology","Complex_analysis","Natural_number","Giuseppe_Peano","Peano_axioms","Mathematics","Axiom","Consistency_proof","Boolean-valued_function","Deductive_reasoning","Mathematical_proof","Axiom_schema","Gödel's_incompleteness_theorem","Hilbert-style_deduction_system","Logicism","Prime_Number","Recursion","Systems_theory"]}
