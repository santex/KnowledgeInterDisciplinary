The display can be by facial, vocal, or gestural means (APA\n2006, p.Â 26). When displayed affect is different from the subjective\naffect, it is incongruent affect. Some professionals use the term \"affect\" to\nmean \"affect display\".[http://www.abess.com/glossary.html]\n\nAffect display refers to the impetus for observable expression of emotion; for\nthe human being that expression or feeling displayed to others through facial\nexpressions, hand gestures, tone of voice and other emotional signs such as\nlaughter or tears is a part of a series of non-conscious or conscious cognitive\nevents. Many aspects of the expressions vary between and within cultures and are\ndisplayed in various forms ranging from the most discreet of facial expressions\nto the most dramatic and prolific gestures (Batson, 1992).\n\nAffect display is also a critical facet of communication in the social domain.\nInterpersonal communication is colored by displayed affect and there are various\ntheories on affective reactions to stimuli to include conscious and non-\nconscious reaction and positive or negative affect.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Affect_display","recorded":1362889827,"links":15,"instances":["psychology","psychology","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Emotion"],"headings":["Theoretical perspective","Non-conscious affect and perception","Arousal","Affect and mood","Gender and affective displays","Affect and the present moment","Meanings in art","Conclusion","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["affect","psychology"],["stimulus","physiology"],["mood","psychology"],["affect","psychology"],["affect","psychology"]],"members":["mood","affect","stimulus"],"related":["Psychology","Affect_(psychology)","Emotion","Feeling","Facial_expression","Gesture","Tone_of_voice","Laughter","Tears","Cultures","Facial_expressions","Gestures","Communication","Interpersonal_communication","Stimulus_(physiology)","Robert_B._Zajonc","Pleasure","Temperament","Socialization","Idiosyncrasies","Arousal","Evolutionary_constraints","Arousal","Physiological","Mood_(psychology)","Subjective_well-being","Gender","Cultures","Affect_(psychology)","Arousal","Cognition","Perception","Affect_(psychology)","Affect_theory","Affective","Affective_spectrum","Deception","Discrete_Emotions_Theory","Emotion","Emotional_contagion","Emotional_labor","Empathy","Facial_communication","Interpersonal_deception_theory","Psychopathy","Self-awareness","Self-deception","Silvan_Tomkins","Sincerity"]}
