Abandoned land resulting from\n  | shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for arable land\n  | are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially\n  | cultivable. Arable land is a category of agricultural land,\n  | which, according to Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) definition,\n  | additionally includes land under permanent or perennial crops, such as fruit\n  | plantations, as well as permanent pastures, for grazing of livestock. In\n  | 2008, the world's total arable land amounted to 13,805,153 kmÂ², and\n  | 48,836,976 kmÂ² was classified as \"agricultural land.\" \n\nAlthough constrained by land mass and topology, the amount of arable land, both\nregionally and globally, fluctuates due to human and climatic factors such as\nirrigation, deforestation, desertification, terracing, landfill, and urban\nsprawl. Researchers study the impact of these changes on food\nproduction.\n\nThe most productive portion of arable land is that from sediments left by rivers\nand the sea in geological times. In modern times, rivers do not generally flood\nas often in areas employing flood control.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Arable_land","recorded":1362373423,"links":40,"instances":["biaxially_oriented","economics","soil"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Agricultural land"],"headings":["Non-arable land","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/040719_172_dorset_marnhull2.jpg/220px-040719_172_dorset_marnhull2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e2/Famlandstburyan.JPG/220px-Famlandstburyan.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Arable_land_percent_world.png/230px-Arable_land_percent_world.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/KerbauJawa.jpg/230px-KerbauJawa.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["land","economics"],["pet_film","biaxially_oriented"],["fertility","soil"]],"members":["pet_film","land","fertility"],"related":["Dorset","England","English_channel","Geography","Agriculture","Latin_language","Plough","Land_(economics)","Agriculture","Meadow","Crop_rotation","Agricultural_land","Food_and_Agriculture_Organization","Sediment","Flood_control","Desert","Photosynthesis","Starvation","Nomad","Starvation","Self-sufficient","Desalination","Hydroponic","Pesticide","Reverse_osmosis","PET_film_(biaxially_oriented)","Seawater_Greenhouse","Aran_Islands","Ireland","Isle_of_Arran","Scotland","Firth_of_Clyde","Israel","Desalination","Slash_and_burn","Terra_preta","Dust_bowl","Great_Depression","Rainforest","Madagascar","Slash-and-burn","Illegal_logging_in_Madagascar","Shifting_cultivation","Erosion","Sodium","Calcium","Magnesium","Fertility_(soil)","Land_use_statistics_by_country","List_of_environment_topics"]}
