{"cursor":"25197","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" An 'antireflective' or 'anti-reflection' ('AR')' coating' is a type of optical\n coating applied to the surface of lenses and other optical devices to reduce\n reflection. This improves the efficiency of the system since less light is\n lost. In complex systems such as a telescope, the reduction in reflections\n also improves the contrast of the image by elimination of stray light. This is\n especially important in planetary astronomy. In other applications, the\n primary benefit is the elimination of the reflection itself, such as a coating\n on eyeglass lenses that makes the eyes of the wearer more visible to others,\n or a coating to reduce the glint from a covert viewer's binoculars or\n telescopic sight.\n\nMany coatings consist of transparent thin film structures with alternating\nlayers of contrasting refractive index. Layer thicknesses are chosen to produce\ndestructive interference in the beams reflected from the interfaces, and\nconstructive interference in the corresponding transmitted beams. This makes the\nstructure's performance change with wavelength and incident angle, so that color\neffects often appear at oblique angles. A wavelength range must be specified\nwhen designing or ordering such coatings, but good performance can often be\nachieved for a relatively wide range of frequencies: usually a choice of IR,\nvisible, or UV is offered.\n","linknr":406,"url":"Anti-reflective_coating","recorded":1362481705,"links":41,"instances":["optics","wave_propagation","vision","electromagnetic_radiation","optics","optics","physics","optics","optics","waves","waves","physics","optics","physics","optics"],"pdf":["http://people.rit.edu/deeemc/courses/0305-676/reference/arcs/understanding_BARC.pdf","http://www.fraunhofer.de/archiv/magazin04-08/fhg/Images/magazine2.2005_tcm6-43699.pdf","http://www.fraunhofer.de/archiv/magazin04-08/fhg/Images/magazine2.2005_tcm6-43699.pdf","http://www.display-optics.com/pdf/Moth-eye%20Antireflective%20Microstructure.pdf","http://www.display-optics.com/pdf/Moth-eye%20Antireflective%20Microstructure.pdf","http://aix.upol.cz/~krepelka/jmo1992.pdf","http://aix.upol.cz/~krepelka/jmo1992.pdf","http://planck.reduaz.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/OptLett2005.pdf","http://planck.reduaz.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/OptLett2005.pdf"],"categories":["Thin-film
