{"cursor":"20787","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Autophagy' (or 'autophagocytosis') is the basic catabolic mechanism that\ninvolves cell degradation of unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components\nthrough the lysosomal machinery (from the Greek words,\nauto \"self\" and phagein \"to eat\"). The breakdown of cellular components can\nensure cellular survival during starvation by maintaining cellular energy\nlevels. Autophagy, if regulated, ensures the synthesis,\ndegradation and recycling of cellular components. During this\nprocess, targeted cytoplasmic constituents are isolated from the rest of the\ncell within the autophagosomes, which are then fused with lysosomes and degraded\nor recycled. There are three different forms of\nautophagy that are commonly described, which include macroautophagy,\nmicroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy. In\nthe context of disease, autophagy has been seen as an adaptive response to\nsurvival, whereas in other cases it appears to promote cell death and\nmorbidity.\n","linknr":503,"url":"Autophagy","recorded":1362484365,"links":33,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular processes","Programmed cell death","Immunology"],"headings":["Process and Pathways","Functions","Autophagy and caloric restriction","Autophagy and exercise","See also","References","External links","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Autophagy_diagram_PLoS_Biology.jpg/220px-Autophagy_diagram_PLoS_Biology.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Catabolic","Lysosome","Greek_language","Cytoplasm","Organelle","Proteins","Biological_membrane","Phosphoinositide-3-kinase","Beclin_1","Ubiquitin","ATG4","ATG12","ATG5","ATG16L1","Endocytosis","Hsc70","Phagosome","Organelle","Phagolysosome","Pathogen","Endosome","Pattern_recognition_receptor","Toll-like_receptor","RNA","Interferon","Cytokine","Galectin-8","Vacuole","CALCOCO2","Apoptosis","Programmed_cell_death","Caloric_restriction","Nematode","Resveratrol","Beclin_1","Homeostasis","Muscle","University_of_Texas_Southwestern_Medical_Center","Dallas","Mouse","BCL2","Glucose","Skeletal_muscle","Collagen_VI","Collagen_VI","Autophagy_database","Autophagin","Apoptosis","Residual_body","Sub-lethal_damage","Ubiquitin","Xenophagy"]}
