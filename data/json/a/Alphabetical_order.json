{"cursor":"22873","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Alphabetical order' is a system whereby strings of characters are placed in\norder based on the position of the characters in the conventional ordering of an\nalphabet. It is one of the methods of collation.\n\nTo determine which of two strings comes first in alphabetical order, their first\nletters are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes\nearlier in the alphabet is the one which comes first in alphabetical order. If\nthe first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on.\nIf a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while\nthe other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in\nalphabetical order.\n\nCapital letters are generally considered to be identical to their corresponding\nsmall letters for the purposes of alphabetical ordering, though conventions may\nbe adopted to handle situations where two strings differ only in capitalization.\nVarious conventions also exist for the handling of strings containing spaces,\nmodified letters (such as those with diacritics), and non-letter characters such\nas marks of punctuation.\n\nThe result of placing a set of words or strings in alphabetical order is that\nall the strings beginning with the same letter are grouped together; and within\nthat grouping all words beginning with the same two-letter sequence are grouped\ntogether; and so on. The system thus tends to maximize the number of common\ninitial letters between adjacent words.\n","linknr":328,"url":"Alphabetical_order","recorded":1362554519,"links":26,"instances":["letter","digraph","symbol","alphabet","letter","orthography","character","language","digraph","grammar","letter","novel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Collation"],"headings":["History","Ordering in the Latin alphabet","Automation","Similar orderings","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","symbol"],["letter","alphabet"],["space","symbol"],["space","character"],["english","language"],["article","grammar"],["the_shining","novel"],["digraph","orthography"],["ch","digraph"],["dz","digraph"],["ij","letter"],["thorn","letter"],["eth","letter"]],"members":["thorn","dz","character","letter","eth","digraph","space","english","ch","article","ij","the_shining"],"related":["Character_string","Character_(symbol)","Alphabet","Collation","Letter_(alphabet)","Capital_letter","Space_(symbol)","Diacritic","Punctuation","Varro","Sextus_Pompeius_Festus","Harpocration","Homer","Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge","Latin_alphabet","Space_(character)","Hyphen","English_(language)","Diacritic","Family_name","Given_name","Article_(grammar)","The_Shining_(novel)","Summer_of_Sam","Lexicographic_order","Macedonia_naming_dispute","United_Nations","Thailand","East_Timor","Leet","Numeral","Leet","Extended_Latin_alphabet","Digraph_(orthography)","Spanish_language","Royal_Spanish_Academy","Azerbaijani_language","Turkish_alphabet","Breton_language","Bosnian_language","Croatian_language","Serbian_language","Czech_language","Slovak_language","Caron","Ch_(digraph)","H","I","Dz_(digraph)","DŽ","Ď","E","Danish_and_Norwegian_alphabet","Glyph","Æ","Ø","Å","Dutch_language","IJ_(letter)","IJmuiden","IJssel","Esperanto","Circumflex","C-circumflex","G-circumflex","H-circumflex","J-circumflex","S-circumflex","U-breve","Breve","Estonian_language","Õ","Ä","Ö","Ü","W","Š","Z","Ž","S","Estonian_alphabet","Faroese_alphabet","Æ","Ø","Faroese_alphabet","D","A","I","O","U","Y","C","Q","X","W","Z","A","Á","B","D","Ð","V","Y","Ý","Æ","Ø","Filipino_language","Filipino_orthography","Ñ","Filipino_language","Tilde","Finnish_alphabet","French_language","German_alphabet","Ä","Ö","Ü","Ss","Hungarian_language","Icelandic_language","Þ","Ð","Acute_accent","Þ","Æ","Anglo-Saxons","Wynn","Thorn_(letter)","Eth_(letter)","D","Lithuanian_language","Y","J","Polish_language","Portuguese_alphabet","Romanian_language","Spanish_alphabet","Real_Academia_Española","Ñ","Swedish_alphabet","Vowel","Å","Ä","Ö","Turkish_alphabet","Turkic_languages","Azeri_language","Jaŋalif","Tatar_language","Gha","G","H","Welsh_language","Collation_algorithm","Sorting_algorithm","Unicode_Collation_Algorithm","Unicode","Common_Locale_Data_Repository","Alphabet","Syllabary","Abugida","Logograph","Hanzi","Kanji","Radical-and-stroke_sorting","Lexicographical_order","Algorithm","ASCII","Unicode","ASCIIbetical_order","Collation"]}
