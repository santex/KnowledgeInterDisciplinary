Schwarzenegger served two terms as the\n38th Governor of California from 2003 until 2011.\n\nSchwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. He won the Mr. Universe\ntitle at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times.\nSchwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in bodybuilding and has written\nmany books and articles on the sport. Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a\nHollywood action film icon. He was nicknamed the \"Austrian Oak\" and the \"Styrian\nOak\" in his bodybuilding days, \"Arnie\" during his acting career and more\nrecently \"The Governator\" (a portmanteau of \"Governor\" and \"The Terminator\" â\none of his best-known movie roles).\n\nAs a Republican, he was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall\nelection to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. Schwarzenegger was sworn in on\nNovember 17, 2003, to serve the remainder of Davis's term. Schwarzenegger was\nthen re-elected on November 7, 2006, in California's 2006 gubernatorial\nelection, to serve a full term as governor, defeating Democrat Phil Angelides,\nwho was California State Treasurer at the time. Schwarzenegger was sworn in for\nhis second term on January 5, 2007. In 2011, Schwarzenegger completed\nhis second term as governor, and it was announced that he had separated from\nMaria Shriver, his wife for the last 25 years, and a member of the influential\nKennedy family, as a niece of the late Democrat US President John F. Kennedy.\n","linknr":1954,"url":"Arnold_Schwarzenegger","recorded":1362481231,"links":145,"instances":["canadian_tv_series","wrestler","genre","2004","character","liturgy","presenter","united_states","filmmaking","1990","drug","weightlifting","document","finance","am","exercise"],"pdf":["https://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/slmag/2004/04SLDec_Schwarzenegger.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080414021559/https://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/slmag/2004/04SLDec_Schwarzenegger.pdf","https://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/slmag/2004/04SLDec_Schwarzenegger.pdf","https://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/slmag/2004/04SLDec_Schwarzenegger.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080414021559/https://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/slmag/2004/04SLDec_Schwarzenegger.pdf","https://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/slmag/2004/04SLDec_Schwarzenegger.pdf"],"categories":["1947
