      "text" : "\n\n is approximately 15.56 squares.]] 'Area' is a quantity that expresses the\n extent of a two-dimensional surface or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane.\n Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that\n would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint\n necessary to cover the surface with a single coat.<ref name=MathWorld></ref> It\n is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional\n concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).\n\nThe area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed\nsize.<ref name=AF/> In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit\nof area is the square metre (written as m<sup>2</sup>), which is the area of a\nsquare whose sides are one metre long.<ref name=B>Bureau International des Poids\net Mesures [http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/ Resolution 12 of the 11th\nmeeting of the CGPM (1960)], retrieved 15 July 2012</ref> A shape with an area\nof three square metres would have the same area as three such squares. In\nmathematics, the unit square is defined to have area one, and the area of any\nother shape or surface is a dimensionless real number.\n\nThere are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as\ntriangles, rectangles, and circles. Using these formulas, the area of any\npolygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles.<ref\nname=bkos>}}</ref> For shapes with curved boundary, calculus is usually required\nto compute the area. Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane\nfigures was a major motivation for the historical development of\ncalculus.<ref></ref>\n\nFor a solid shape such as a sphere, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary\nsurface is called the surface area.<ref name=MathWorld/><ref\nname=MathWorldSurfaceArea></ref> Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes\nwere computed by the ancient Greeks, but computing the surface area of a more\ncomplicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus.\n\nArea plays an important role in modern mathematics. In addition to its obvious\nimportance in geometry and calculus, area is related to the definition of\ndeterminants in linear algebra, and is a basic property of surfaces in\ndifferential geometry.<ref name=\"doCarmo\">do Carmo, Manfredo. Differential\nGeometry of Curves and Surfaces. Prentice-Hall, 1976. Page 98, ISBN 978-0-13-212589-\n5</ref> In analysis, the area of a subset of the plane is defined using Lebesgue\nmeasure,<ref name=\"Rudin\">Walter Rudin, Real and Complex Analysis, McGraw-Hill,\n1966, ISBN 0-07-100276-6.</ref> though not every subset is\nmeasurable.<ref>Gerald Folland, Real Analysis: modern techniques and their\napplications, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1999,Page 20,ISBN 0-471-31716-0</ref> In\ngeneral, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-\ndimensional regions.<ref name=MathWorld/>\n\nArea can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a\ncollection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers. It can be proved\nthat such a function exists.\n",
