This rating is similar to Intel's thermal design power\n(TDP) used with Pentium and Core 2 processors, measuring the energy consumption\nof high workloads, which in numbers are slightly lower than the TDP value of the\nsame processor.\n\nAMD claims the ACP rating includes the power consumption when running several\nbenchmarks, like TPC-C, SPECcpu2006, SPECjbb2005 and\n[http://www.streambench.org/ STREAM Benchmark] (memory bandwidth)\n[http://www.anandtech.com/IT/showdoc.aspx?i=3091&p=2 AnandTech report],\nretrieved September 10, 2007 [http://www.dailytech.com/AMD+Unveils+Ba-\nrcelona+Architecture/article6299.htm DailyTech report], retrieved September 10,\n2007 [http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/5925_large_amd_explains_acp.-\npng DailyTech image] detailing ACP, retrieved September 10, 2007 which AMD\nsaid is a better method as a power consumption measurement for data centers and\nserver intensive workload environments.
