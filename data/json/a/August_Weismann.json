[http://www.nndb.com/people/747/000091474/ August Weismann].\nwww.nndb.com Ernst Mayr ranked him the second most notable evolutionary\ntheorist of the 19th century, after Charles Darwin. Weismann became the Director\nof the Zoological Institute and the first Professor of Zoology at Freiburg.\n\nHis main contribution was the germ plasm theory, according to which (in a\nmulticellular organism) inheritance only takes place by means of the germ\ncellsâthe gametes such as egg cells and sperm cells. Other cells of the\nbodyâsomatic cellsâdo not function as agents of heredity. The effect is one-way:\ngerm cells produce somatic cells and are not affected by anything the somatic\ncells learn or therefore any ability the body acquires during its life. Genetic\ninformation cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation.\nThis is referred to as the Weismann barrier.

This idea, if true, rules out the\ninheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Jean-Baptiste\nLamarck. Huxley, Julian 1942. Evolution, the modern synthesis. p. 17\n\nThe idea of the Weismann barrier is central to the Modern evolutionary\nsynthesis, though it is not expressed today in the same terms. In Weismann's\nopinion the largely random process of mutation, which must occur in the gametes\n(or stem cells that make them) is the only source of change for natural\nselection to work on. Weismann was one of the first biologists to deny soft\ninheritance entirely.

Weismann's ideas preceded the rediscovery of\nGregor Mendel's work, and though Weismann was cagey about accepting Mendelism,\nyounger workers soon made the connection.\n\nWeismann is much admired today. Ernst Mayr judged him to be the most important\nevolutionary thinker between Darwin and the evolutionary synthesis around\n1930â40, and was \"one of the great biologists of all time\".
