{"cursor":"79205","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n, in the Atapuerca Mountains, Spain, 2008]] 'Archaeology', or 'archeology' (from Greek , archaiologia â ,\narkhaios, \"ancient\"; and , -logia, \"-logy \"), is the study\nof human activity in the past, primarily through the recovery and analysis of\nthe material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which\nincludes artifacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes (the\narchaeological record). Because archaeology employs a wide range of different\nprocedures, it can be considered to be both a science and a humanity, and in the United States it is thought of as a branch\nof anthropology, although in Europe it is\nviewed as a separate discipline.\n\nArchaeology studies human history from the development of the first stone tools\nin eastern Africa 3.4 million years ago up until recent decades. (Archaeology does not include the discipline of\npaleontology.) It is of most importance for learning about prehistoric\nsocieties, when there are no written records for historians to study, making up\nover 99% of total human history, from the Palaeolithic until the advent of\nliteracy in any given society. Archaeology has\nvarious goals, which range from studying human evolution to cultural evolution\nand understanding culture history.\n\nThe discipline involves surveyance, excavation and eventually analysis of data\ncollected to learn more about the past. In broad scope, archaeology relies on\ncross-disciplinary research. It draws upon anthropology, history, art history,\nclassics, ethnology, geography,\ngeology, linguistics, semiology, physics, information sciences,\nchemistry, statistics, paleoecology, paleontology, paleozoology,\npaleoethnobotany, and paleobotany.\n\nArchaeology developed out of antiquarianism in Europe during the 19th century,\nand has since become a discipline practiced across the world. Since its early\ndevelopment, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed,\nincluding maritime archaeology, feminist archaeology and archaeoastronomy, and\nnumerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid\narchaeological investigation. Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many\nproblems, ranging from dealing with pseudoarchaeology to the looting of\nartifacts and opposition to the excavation of human remains.\n","linknr":1490,"url":"Archeology","recorded":1362480856,"links":172,"instances":["archaeology","anthropologist","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","genus","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","magazine","aircraft","ipinch","archaeology","tool","statistics","archaeology","magazine","archaeology","archaeologist","1999_film","philosophy","social_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf","http://www.lycoming.edu/library/archives/honorspdfs/Meghan_Strong.pdf","http://www.lycoming.edu/library/archives/honorspdfs/Meghan_Strong.pdf"],"categories":["Anthropology","Archaeology|","Auxiliary
