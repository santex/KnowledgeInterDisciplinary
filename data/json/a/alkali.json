Some authors also\ndefine an alkali as a base that dissolves in water. A solution of a soluble base\nhas a pH greater than 7. The adjective 'alkaline' is commonly used in English as\na synonym for base, especially for soluble bases. This broad use of the term is\nlikely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the\nArrhenius definition of a base and are still among the most common bases.\n",
