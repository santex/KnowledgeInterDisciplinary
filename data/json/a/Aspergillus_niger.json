It causes a disease called black mold on certain fruits and\nvegetables such as grapes, onions, and peanuts, and is a common contaminant of\nfood. It is ubiquitous in soil and is commonly reported from indoor\nenvironments, where its black colonies can be confused with those of\n[[Stachybotrys]] (species of which have also been called \"black mould\").\n\nSome strains of A. niger have been reported to produce potent mycotoxins called\nochratoxins, but\n[http://www.leatherheadfood.com/eman2/fsheet3.asp other sources] disagree,\nclaiming this report is based upon misidentification of the fungal species.\nRecent evidence suggests some true A. niger strains do produce ochratoxin A. It also produces the isoflavone orobol.\n","linknr":256,"url":"Aspergillus_niger","recorded":1362504779,"links":27,"instances":["dietary_supplement","united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aspergillus|Niger","Biotechnology","Plant pathogens and diseases","Sequenced genomes"],"headings":["Taxonomy","Pathogenicity","Industrial uses","Other uses","Genetics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Aspergillus_niger_Micrograph.jpg/270px-Aspergillus_niger_Micrograph.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Aspergillus_niger_on_SDA.JPG/200px-Aspergillus_niger_on_SDA.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Karl_Johanssvamp%2C_Iduns_kokbok.png/25px-Karl_Johanssvamp%2C_Iduns_kokbok.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["beano","dietary_supplement"]],"members":["beano","food_and_drug_administration"],"related":["Agar_plate","Eukaryote","Fungi","Ascomycota","Pezizomycotina","Eurotiomycetes","Eurotiales","Trichocomaceae","Phillippe_Édouard_Léon_van_Tieghem","Fungus","Mycotoxin","Ochratoxin","Ochratoxin_A","Orobol","Spore","Aspergillosis","Horticulture","Peat","Otomycosis","Ear_canal","Tympanic_membrane","Citric_acid","Gluconic_acid","World_Health_Organisation","GRAS","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act","Enzyme","Glucoamylase","High_fructose_corn_syrup","Pectinase","Wine_clarification","Alpha-galactosidase","Beano_(dietary_supplement)","Macromolecule","NMR_spectroscopy","Pu-erh_tea","Okinawa","Awamori","Shochu","RNase","Angiogenesis","Carcinogen","Glucose_oxidase","Alpha-galactosidase","Biosensor","Glucose","Alpha_1-6_bonds","Melibiose","Raffinose","Stachyose","Coeliac_disease","Opium","Genome","Contamination_control"]}
