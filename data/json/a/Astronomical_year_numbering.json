{"cursor":"8942","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Astronomical year numbering' is based on AD/CE year numbering, but follows\nnormal decimal integer numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a year 0, the years\nbefore that are designated with negative numbers and the years after that are\ndesignated with positive numbers. Astronomers\nuse the Julian calendar for years before 1582, including this year 0, and the\nGregorian calendar for years after 1582 as exemplified by Jacques Cassini\n(1740), Jacques Cassini, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-\nPA10 Tables Astronomiques] (1740), Explication et Usage pp. 5 (PA5), 7 (PA7),\nTables pp. 10 (RA1-PA10), 22 (RA1-PA22), 63 (RA1-PA63), 77 (RA1-PA77), 91 (RA1-\nPA91), 105 (RA1-PA105), 119 (RA1-PA119).

Fred Espenak, [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html\nPhases of the Moon: â99 to 0 (100 to 1 BCE)] NASA Eclipse web site\n\nThe prefix AD and the suffixes CE, BC or BCE (Common Era, Before Christ or\nBefore Common Era) are dropped. The year 1 BC/BCE is\nnumbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered â1, and in general the year n BC/BCE is\nnumbered \"â(n â 1)\" (a negative number equal to 1 â\nn). The numbers of AD/CE years are not changed and are written with either no\nsign or a positive sign; thus in general n AD/CE is simply n or +n. For normal calculation a number zero is often needed, here most\nnotably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans the epoch;\nthe end years need only be subtracted from each other.\n\nThe system is so named due to its use in astronomy. Few other disciplines\noutside history deal with the time before year 1, exceptions being\ndendrochronology, archaeology and geology, the latter two of which use 'years\nbefore the present'. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and\nhistorical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical\nwhen calculating astronomical events like eclipses or planetary conjunctions to\ndetermine when historical events which mention them occurred.\n","linknr":537,"url":"Astronomical_year_numbering","recorded":1362669933,"links":24,"instances":["astronomy","w3c"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Calendar eras","Chronology","Specific calendars","Time in astronomy"],"headings":["Year zero usage","Signed years without year 0","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["0","number"],["epoch","astronomy"],["xml_schema","w3c"]],"members":["epoch","xml_schema"],"related":["Anno_Domini","Common_Era","Decimal","Integer","Year_zero","Negative_number","Julian_calendar","Gregorian_calendar","Jacques_Cassini","Simon_Newcomb","Fred_Espenak","0_(number)","Epoch_(astronomy)","Astronomy","History","Dendrochronology","Archaeology","Geology","Before_Present","Rudolphine_Tables","Johannes_Kepler","Philippe_de_la_Hire","Jacques_Cassini","NASA","XML_Schema_(W3C)","XML","ISO_8601","Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar","W3C_recommendation","Backwards_compatibility","ISO_8601","Astronomical_chronology"]}
