{"cursor":"3634","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Advocates for Informed Choice' (AIC) is a non-profit organization for\nadvocacy for the rights of children with intersex or differences of sex\ndevelopment (DSD). Founded in 2006 by Anne Tamar-Mattis, graduate of Boalt Hall\nSchool of Law, University of California at Berkeley, and funded through the\nEqual Justice Works fellowships, it is one of two major organizations actively\ninvolved in pressing for clinical reform in dealing with rights of intersex\npeople, the other being Accord Alliance. Right\nafter graduating from law school, Anne Tamar-Mattis started her work with AIC\nand has had previous years of experience as the Program Director for the San\nFrancisco LGBT Community Center.\n\nAIC are the first group in the US to take \"a coordinated strategy of legal\nadvocacy for the rights of children with intersex conditions or\nDSDs\". Most of their activism is in lobbying for the importance of\nchildren with intersex conditions or DSDs in law, by creating possible legal\nframeworks to be protect the child's rights. They believe that\nencouragement of open discussion of intersex between doctors, parents, and\nactivists, will bring attention to the importance of children and newborns with\nintersex conditions or DSDs. Some of the issues that are dealt with are informed\nconsent, insurance, identity documents, medical records retrieval, and medical\nprivacy. Among their goals is to improve communication between the\nmedical and intersex communities.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Advocates_for_Informed_Choice","recorded":1364034810,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Non-profit_organization","/wiki/Intersex","/wiki/Disorders_of_sex_development","/wiki/UC_Berkeley_School_of_Law","/wiki/Equal_Justice_Works","/wiki/Accord_Alliance","#cite_note-HealthcareEthics-1","/wiki/San_Francisco_LGBT_Community_Center","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Disorders_of_sex_development","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Informed_consent","/wiki/Medical_privacy","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-LambdaLegal-6","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Normative","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=edit&section=2","http://aiclegal.org","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-HealthcareEthics_1-0","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0176415532","#cite_ref-2","http://www.law.berkeley.edu/6306.htm","http://www.law.berkeley.edu/6306.htm","#cite_ref-3","http://aiclegal.org/about/","http://aiclegal.org/about/","#cite_ref-4","http://www.californialawreview.org/articles/sterilization-and-minors-with-intersex-conditions-in-california-law","#cite_ref-5","http://aiclegal.org/issues/","http://aiclegal.org/issues/","#cite_ref-LambdaLegal_6-0","http://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/publications/downloads/impact_200910_being-intersex.pdf","#cite_ref-7","http://inter-actyouth.tumblr.com/bios","http://inter-actyouth.tumblr.com/bios","#cite_ref-8","http://inter-actyouth.tumblr.com/mission","http://inter-actyouth.tumblr.com/mission","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&oldid=536872775","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Sonoma_County,_California","/wiki/Category:501(c)(3)_nonprofit_organizations","/wiki/Category:Organizations_based_in_the_San_Francisco_Bay_Area","/wiki/Category:Intersex_organizations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Advocates+for+Informed+Choice&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Advocates+for+Informed+Choice","/wiki/Advocates_for_Informed_Choice","/wiki/Talk:Advocates_for_Informed_Choice","#","/wiki/Advocates_for_Informed_Choice","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Advocates_for_Informed_Choice","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Advocates_for_Informed_Choice","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&oldid=536872775","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&id=536872775","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Advocates+for+Informed+Choice","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Advocates+for+Informed+Choice&oldid=536872775&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Advocates_for_Informed_Choice&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocates_for_Informed_Choice","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedi
