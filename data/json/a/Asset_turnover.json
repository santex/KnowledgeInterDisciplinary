Companies in the retail\nindustry tend to have a very high turnover ratio due mainly to cutthroat and\ncompetitive pricing.\n\n\\mbox{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\mbox{Net Sales Revenue}}{\\mbox{Average\nTotal Assets}}\n\n* \"Sales\" is the value of \"Net Sales\" or \"Sales\" from the company's\n  income statement\n* \"Average Total Assets\" is the average of the values of \"Total assets\" from the\n  company's balance sheet in the beginning and the end of the fiscal period. It\n  is calculated by adding up the assets at the beginning of the period and the\n  assets at the end of the period, then dividing that number by two.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Asset_turnover","recorded":1362554906,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Financial ratios"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/3/28357c9f28d3c74cc57e165d17514eac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Usdollar100front.jpg/43px-Usdollar100front.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Financial_ratio","Asset","Income_statement","Balance_sheet"]}
