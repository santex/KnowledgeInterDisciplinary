{"cursor":"26370","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'apoptosome' is a large quaternary protein structure formed in the process\nof apoptosis. Its formation is triggered by the release of cytochrome c from the\nmitochondria in response to an internal (intrinsic) or external (extrinsic) cell\ndeath stimulus. Stimuli can vary from DNA damage and viral infection to\ndevelopmental cues such as those leading to the degradation of a tadpole's tail.\n\nIn mammalian cells, once cytochrome c is released, it binds to the cytosolic\nprotein Apaf-1 to facilitate the formation of apoptosome. An early biochemical\nstudy suggests a two-to-one ratio of cytochrome c to apaf-1 for apoptosome\nformation. However, recent structural studies suggest the cytochrome c to apaf-1\nratio is one-to-one. It has also been shown that the nucleotide dATP as third\ncomponent binds to apaf-1, however its exact role is still debated. The\nmammalian apoptosome had never been crystallized, but a human APAF-1/cytochrome-\nc apoptosome has been imaged at lower (2 nm) resolution by cryogenic\ntransmission electron microscopy 10 years ago, Acehan D, Jiang X, Morgan DG,\nHeuser JE, Wang X, Akey CW \"Three-dimensional structure of the apoptosome:\nimplications for assembly, procaspase-9 binding, and activation.\" Mol Cell. 2002\nFeb;9(2):423-32. revealing a wheel-like particle with 7-fold symmetry.\nRecently, a medium resolution (9.5 ÃngstrÃ¶m) structure of human apoptosome was\nalso solved by cryo-electron microscopy, which allows unambiguous inference for\npositions of all the APAF-1 domains (CARD, NBARC and WD40) and cytochrome c.\n\n Once formed, the apoptosome can then recruit and activate\nthe inactive pro-caspase-9. Once activated, this initiator caspase can then\nactivate effector caspases and trigger a cascade of events leading to apoptosis.\n","linknr":409,"url":"Apoptosome","recorded":1362484442,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/l06q5l5422173145/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Organelles","Apoptosis","Programmed cell death"],"headings":["History","Structure","Mechanism of Action","Research Areas","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Hapop.jpg/220px-Hapop.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Apop_atomic_model.jpg/220px-Apop_atomic_model.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Apoptosis","Cytochrome_c","Mitochondria","DNA_damage","Viral_infection","Tadpole","Cytochrome_c","Apaf-1","Adenosine_triphosphate","Nanometer","Transmission_electron_microscopy","Cryo-electron_microscopy","Caspase","Bcl-2","Apoptosis","Mitochondria","Ternary_complex","Caspase-9","Bcl-xL","APAF1","Mammal","Hydrolysis","Adenosine_triphosphate","Oligomer","Oligomer","Cytochrome_c","Leukemia","Ovarian_cancer","Viral_disease","Enzyme","APAF1","Mitochondria","Apoptosis","Adenosine_triphosphate","Cytochrome_c","Cytosol","C-terminus","Oligomer","Caspase-9","CARD_domain","N-terminus","Caspase","Intrinsic_apoptosis","Apoptosis","Heptamer","Cryo-electron_microscopy","WD40_repeat","WD40_repeat","APAF1","WD40_repeat","AAA_protein","Apoptosis","Catalysis","Intrinsic_apoptosis","Mitochondria","Cytochrome_c","APAF1","Calcium","Ion","Mitochondrial_permeability_transition_pore","Intermembrane_space","Voltage-dependent_anion_channel","Inner_membrane","Adenine_nucleotide_translocator","Cyclophilin","Outer_mitochondrial_membrane","Semipermeable_membrane","Protein","Cytosol","Mitochondrial_permeability_transition_pore","Membrane_potential","Ciclosporin","Apoptosis","Monomer","WD40_repeat","Enzyme_inhibitor","Mass_spectrometry","Caspase","CARD_domain","Heptameter","ATPase","AAA_protein","Zymogen","Protein_dimer","Alzheimer’s","Parkinson’s","Huntington’s_disease","P53","Suppressor","Caenorhabditis_elegans","Drosophilia","Bcl-2","Bcl-2-associated_X_protein","Bcl-2_homologous_antagonist_killer","Caspase-3","Taurine","The_Proteolysis_Map"]}
