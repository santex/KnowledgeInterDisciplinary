{"cursor":"74583","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Antibiotic resistance' is a form of drug resistance whereby some (or, less\ncommonly, all) sub-populations of a microorganism, usually a bacterial species,\nare able to survive exposure to one or more antibiotics. Accordingly, pathogenic\nspecies which have become resistant cause infections which cannot be treated\nwith the usual, formerly efficacious antibiotic drugs and/or their usual,\nformerly efficacious, dosages and concentrations. Resistance may be\ninstrinsic/primary (transmitted from another person) or acquired (where bacteria\ndevelop spontaneous mutations). Some clinically relevant pathogens have\ndeveloped resistance to multiple antibiotics and are dubbed '[[multidrug\nresistant]]' (MDR pathogens). More recently, the colloquial term 'superbug' has\nbecome widespread in both popular and technical accounts of the phenomenon with\nwhich it is synonymous.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a serious and growing phenomenon in contemporary\nmedicine and has emerged as one of the eminent public health concerns of the\n21st century, particularly as it pertains to pathogenic organisms (the term is\nnot especially relevant to organisms which don't cause disease in humans). In\nthe simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-\nline antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents.\nTypically, the first-line agent is selected on the basis of several advantages\nincluding safety, availability and cost; comparatively, the second-line agent is\nusually broader in spectrum, possesses a less favourable risk-benefit profile\nand may be more expensive or, in more dire circumstances, locally unavailable.\nIn the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second and even third-line\nantibiotics is sequentially acquired, a case quintessentially illustrated by\n[[Staphylococcus aureus]] in some nosocomial settings. Some pathogens, such as\n[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]], additionally possess a high level of intrinsic\nresistance.\n\nIt may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic mutation, or the\nacquisition of resistance genes from other bacterial species by horizontal gene\ntransfer via conjugation, transduction, or transformation. Many antibiotic\nresistance genes reside on transmissible plasmids, facilitating their transfer.\nExposure to an antibiotic naturally selects for the survival of the organisms\nwith the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may\nreadily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids\nfrequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics.\nThis is not the case for [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]], the bacteria that\ncauses Tuberculosis, since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have\nplasmids http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2115217?dopt=Abstract .\nAlso. M. tuberculosis lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in\norder to share plasmids. http://aac.asm.org/content/53/8/3181 htt-\np://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2115217?dopt=Abstract\n\nGenes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are\nancient. However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial\ninfections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human\nmedicine and veterinary medicine. Any use of antibiotics can increase selective\npressure in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive\nand the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics\nbecomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However,\ndespite a push for new antibiotic therapies there has been a continued decline\nin the number of newly approved drugs. Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a\nsignificant problem.\n\nThe growing prevalence and incidence of infections due to MDR pathogens is\nepitomised by the increasing number of familiar acronyms used to describe the\ncausative agent and sometimes the infection generally; of these, MRSA is\nprobably the most well-known, but others including VISA (vancomycin-intermediate\nS. aureus), VRSA (vancomycin-resistant S. aureus), ESBL (Extended spectrum beta-\nlactamase), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and MRAB (Multidrug-\nresistant A. baumannii) are prominent examples. Nosocomial infections\noverwhelmingly dominate cases where MDR pathogens are implicated, but multidrug-\nresistant infections are also becoming increasingly prevalent in the community.\n","linknr":1046,"url":"Antibiotic_resistance","recorded":1362505232,"links":54,"instances":["microbiology","biology","genetics","journal","genetics"],"pdf":["http://hicsigwiki.asid.net.au/images/4/41/Should_you_stop_an_antibiotic_course_early_if_you_feel_better_R._Everts.pdf","http://hicsigwiki.asid.net.au/images/4/41/Should_you_stop_an_antibiotic_course_early_if_you_feel_better_R._Everts.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/infDis/Cdiff_ICHE08_05.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/infDis/Cdiff_ICHE08_05.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf"],"categories":["Antibiotics","Antibiotic
