Actuaries are professionals who are qualified in this field through\neducation and experience. In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their\ncompetence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations.\n\nActuarial science includes a number of interrelating subjects, including\nprobability, mathematics, statistics, finance, economics, financial economics,\nand computer programming. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic\nmodels in the construction of tables and premiums. The science has gone through\nrevolutionary changes during the last 30 years due to the proliferation of high\nspeed computers and the union of stochastic actuarial models with modern\nfinancial theory .\n\nMany universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in\nactuarial science. In 2010, a study published by job search website\nCareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States . The study used\nfive key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook,\nphysical demands, and stress. A similar study by U.S. News & World Report in\n2006 included actuaries among the 25 Best Professions that it expects will be\nin great demand in the future
