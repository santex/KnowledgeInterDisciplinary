The exact number and placement of endosymbiotic events is currently unknown,\n  so this diagram can be taken only as a general guide It represents the most parsimonious way of explaining the\n  three types of endosymbiotic origins of plastids. These types include the\n  endosymbiotic events of cyanobacteria, red algae and green algae, leading to\n  the hypothesis of the supergroups Archaeplastida, Chromalveolata and Cabozoa\n  respectively. However, the monophyly of Cabozoa has been refuted and the\n  monophylies of Archaeplastida and Chromalveolata are currently strongly\n  challenged. Endosymbiotic events are noted by dotted lines.]]\n\n'Algae' ( or ; singular alga , Latin for \"seaweed\") are a very large and diverse\ngroup of simple, typically autotrophic organisms, ranging from unicellular to\nmulticellular forms, such as the giant kelps that grow to 65 meters in length.\nMost are photosynthetic like plants, and \"simple\" because they lack the many\ndistinct cell and organ types found in land plants. The largest and most complex\nmarine forms are called seaweeds.\n\nThough the prokaryotic cyanobacteria are informally referred to as blue-green\nalgae, this usage is incorrect  since they are\nregarded as bacteria. Ed. Guiry, M.D., John, D.M., Rindi, F and McCarthy,\nT.K. 2007. New Survey of Clare Island Volume 6: The Freshwater and Terrestrial\nAlgae. Royal Irish Academy. ISBN 978-1-904890-31-7 The term algae is now\nrestricted to eukaryotic organisms. All true algae\ntherefore have a nucleus enclosed within a membrane and plastids bound in one\nor more membranes. Round\n(1981) Algae constitute a paraphyletic and polyphyletic group, as they do not include all the descendants of the last\nuniversal ancestor nor do they all descend from a common algal ancestor,\nalthough their plastids seem to have a single origin. Diatoms are also examples of algae.\n\nAlgae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple, asexual cell\ndivision to complex forms of sexual reproduction. Smithsonian National\nMuseum of Natural History; Department of Botany.\nhttp://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm\n\nAlgae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the leaf-\nlike phyllids of bryophytes, rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots,\nleaves and other organs that are found in tracheophytes (vascular plants). Many\nare phototrophic, although some groups contain members that are mixotrophic,\nderiving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by\nosmotrophy, myzotrophy, or phagotrophy. Some unicellular species rely entirely\non external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus.\n\nNearly all algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from\ncyanobacteria, and so produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike\nother photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria.\nFossilized filamentous algae from the Vindhya basin have been dated back to 1.6\nto 1.7 billion years ago.\n","linknr":1106,"url":"Alga","recorded":1362500468,"links":114,"instances":["korean_food","dietary_supplement","seaweed","tissue","anatomy","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/reprint/116/1/9.pdf","http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/reprint/116/1/9.pdf","http://uwsp.edu/cnr/UWEXlakes/laketides/vol26-4/vol26-4.pdf","http://www.hydromentia.com/Products-Services/Algal-Turf-Scrubber/Product-Documentation/Assets/ATS-Technical-Brochure.pdf"],"categories":["Algae|","Endosymbiotic
