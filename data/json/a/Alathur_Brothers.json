The world of Carnatic music knows them as the star duo\nof the twentieth century. They learnt under Alathur Venkatesa Iyer, the father\nof Sivasubramania Iyer. They were not brothers by birth.\n\nThey gave their first concert at Thyagaraja Aradhana festival in Thiruvaiyaru in\n1928. Following the grand tradition set by their guru, the duo excelled in the\nauthentic version of Carnatic music bringing together its technicalities to\ndevelop a taste for this patantara in the audience, both the experts and the\nlaymen, alike.\n\nCombining the strengths of various aspects of Carnatic music, they established a\nstyle of music for themselves. Their music was the result of arduous training,\nconscious evolution of the Lakshya and Lakshana aspects, unique to Carnatic\nmusic and inspiration drawn from many a colossus of bygone era in Carnatic\nmusic. Known to the world to have presented many a complicate \"pallavi\" replete\nwith all its mathematical permutations and combinations of usages, they had\nmastered \"Laya\" at a young age, imbibing the art from their Guru. Not many know\nthough that another stalwart of Carnatic music, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer had\nonce commented that the kind of \"Jeevan\" or life the brothers enthused in the\nvery same compositions others sang on the concert platform was hard to enunciate\nand almost incomparable.\n\nThe finesse and authority with which they handled compositions like Vidulaku\nMrokeda (Mayamalavagowla, Tyagaraja), Mari Mari Ninne (Kambhoji, Tyagaraja),\nEpapamu (Atana, Tyagaraja), Shantamu Lekha (Sama, Tyagaraja), Kalinarula\n(Kuntalavarali, Tyagaraja), Koniyadina (Kambhoji, Veena Kuppaiyer), Shree Matha\nShiva (Begada, Muthuswami Dikshitar), Kanulara Kanti (Danyasi, Wallajahpet\nVenkatramana Bhagavatar) were essays into the very depths of the most authentic\nof Carnatic music.\n\nCompositions in Tamil like Sivanai Ninaindhavar (Hindolam, Kavikunjara\nBharathi) sparkled in their exposition. Exclusive Tiruppugazh concerts were a\nregular with them.\n\nThe Alathur brothers performed with most of the star accompanists of the world\nof Carnatic music. On the violin, earlier they were accompanied by\nThiruvalangadu Sundaresa Iyer, Mayavaram Govindaraja Pillai, Kumbakonam\nRajamanickam Pillai, Mysore T. Chowdiah among others. Later T. N. Krishnan and\nLalgudi G. Jayaraman accompanied them in most of their concerts while Kandadevi\nAzhagirisami accompanied them in a few.\n\nIn the earliest of their concerts, mostly in and around Tiruchirapalli, the\nveteran mridangam exponent, Pudukottai Dakshinamoorthy Pillai accompanied them.\nIt was he who introduced Pazhani Subramania Pillai, son of Pazhani Muthiah\nPillai, himself a close friend of Alathur Venkatesa Iyer, to them. Their regular\nconcerts in Tanjore and later in Madras had brought to them the Mridangam\nmaestro Palghat Mani Iyer. From then onwards their concerts were either with\nPazhani Subramania Pillai on the mridangam or an incomparable combination of\nMani Iyer on the mridangam and Pillai on the Kanjira. It is said that the\nbrothers were at their peak form essaying mind-boggling Pallavis with Lalgudi\nJayaraman on the violin to provide answer to their exulting calculations and\nMani Iyer and Pillai to take it further on to a different plane altogether with\ntheir solo versions, Thaniavardhanam.\n\nFrom 1944 to 1968 the brothers were the court musicians for the Maharajah of\nTravancore.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Alathur_Brothers","recorded":1375065534,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Carnatic_music","/wiki/Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","/wiki/Thyagaraja_Aradhana","/wiki/Thiruvaiyaru","/wiki/Semmangudi_Srinivasa_Iyer","/wiki/Tiruppugazh","/wiki/Tiruchirapalli","/wiki/Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","/wiki/Musician","/wiki/Maharajah","/wiki/Travancore","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&action=edit&section=1","http://archives.chennaionline.com/music/Carnaticmusic/Sep07/09music37.asp","http://archives.chennaionline.com/music/Carnaticmusic/Oct07/10music43.asp","http://www.carnaticcorner.com/articles/alathoor_brothers.htm","http://www.thehinduretailplus.com/thehindu/fr/2004/12/24/stories/2004122402890600.htm","http://www.musicindiaonline.com/music/carnatic_vocal/m/artist.1533/","http://www.carnatica.net/artiste/alathurbros.htm","http://www.musicalnirvana.com/carnatic/alathur_brothers_articles.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&oldid=545525034","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Carnatic_singers","/wiki/Category:Articles_which_use_infobox_templates_with_no_data_rows","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alathur+Brothers&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alathur+Brothers","/wiki/Alathur_Brothers","/wiki/Talk:Alathur_Brothers","#","/wiki/Alathur_Brothers","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Alathur_Brothers","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Alathur_Brothers","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&oldid=545525034","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4708823","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Alathur_Brothers&id=545525034","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Alathur+Brothers","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Alathur+Brothers&oldid=545525034&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Brothers&printable=yes","//ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%82%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8B%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4708823#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alathur_Brothers","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carnatic
