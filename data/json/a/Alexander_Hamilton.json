He became the\nleader of the Federalist Party, created largely in support of his views, and\nwas opposed by the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas Jefferson and\nJames Madison.\n\nHamilton served in the American Revolutionary War. At the start of the war, he\norganized an artillery company and was chosen as its captain. He later became\nthe senior Chernow, p. 90. aide-de-camp and confidant\nto General George Washington, the American commander-in-chief. He served again\nunder Washington in the army raised to defeat the Whiskey Rebellion, a tax\nrevolt of western farmers in 1794. In 1798, Hamilton called for mobilization\nagainst France after the XYZ Affair and secured an appointment as commander of a\nnew army, which he trained for a war. Forrest McDonald, Alexander Hamilton:\na biography, (1982), p. 342 However, the Quasi-War, although hard-fought\nat sea, was never officially declared. In the end, President John Adams found a\ndiplomatic solution that avoided war.\n\nBorn out of wedlock and raised in the West Indies, Hamilton was effectively\norphaned at about the age of 11. Recognized for his abilities and talent, he was\nsponsored by people from his community to go to the North American mainland for\nhis education. He attended King's College (now Columbia University), in New York\nCity. After the American Revolutionary War, Hamilton was elected to the\nContinental Congress from New York. He resigned to practice law and founded the\nBank of New York.\n\nHamilton was among those dissatisfied with the Articles of Confederationâthe\nfirst attempt at a national governing documentâbecause it lacked an executive,\ncourts, and taxing powers. He led the Annapolis Convention, which successfully\ninfluenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention in order to\ncreate a new constitution. He was an active participant at Philadelphia and\nhelped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of the\n[[Federalist Papers]], which supported the new constitution and to this day is\nthe single most important source for Constitutional interpretation. Ira C.\nLupu, \"The Most-Cited Federalist Papers,\" Constitutional Commentary (1998)\n\nIn the new government under President George Washington, Hamilton was appointed\nthe Secretary of the Treasury. An admirer of British political systems, Hamilton\nwas a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully\nargued that the implied powers of the Constitution could be used to fund the\nnational debt, assume state debts, and create the government-owned Bank of the\nUnited States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports and\nlater also by a highly controversial excise tax on whiskey.\n\nEmbarrassed when an extra-marital affair from his past became public, Hamilton\nresigned from office in 1795 and returned to the practice of law in New York. He\nkept his hand in politics and was a powerful influence on the cabinet of\nPresident Adams (1797â1801). Hamilton's opposition to Adams' re-election helped\ncause his defeat in the 1800 election. When in the same contest Thomas Jefferson\nand Aaron Burr tied for the presidency in the electoral college, Hamilton helped\ndefeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and elect Jefferson despite\nphilosophical differences. After failing to support Adams, the Federalist\ncandidate, Hamilton lost some national prominence within the party. Vice\nPresident Burr later ran for governor in New York State, but Hamilton's\ninfluence in his home state was strong enough to again prevent a Burr victory.\nTaking offense at some of Hamilton's comments, Burr challenged him to a duel and\nmortally wounded Hamilton, who died within days.\n","linknr":1795,"url":"Alexander_Hamilton","recorded":1374763510,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Hamilton&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Hamilton&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy#move","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/58/Padlock-olive.svg/20px-Padlock-olive.svg.png","/wiki/File:Alexander_Hamilton_portrait_by_John_Trumbull_1806.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Alexander_Hamilton_portrait_by_John_Trumbull_1806.jpg/220px-Alexander_Hamilton_portrait_by_John_Trumbull_1806.jpg","/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/Oliver_Wolcott,_Jr.","/wiki/Commanding_General_of_the_United_States_Army","/wiki/John_Adams","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/James_Wilkinson","/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/Egbert_Benson","/wiki/Charlestown,_Saint_Kitts_and_Nevis","/wiki/Nevis","/wiki/British_West_Indies","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Federalist_Party","/wiki/Elizabeth_Schuyler_Hamilton","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/Columbia_College,_Columbia_University","/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States)","/wiki/File:Alexander_Hamilton_Signaturert.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Alexander_Hamilton_Signaturert.svg/128px-Alexander_Hamilton_Signaturert.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_New_York.svg/23px-Flag_of_New_York.svg.png","/wiki/New_York","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/US_flag_13_stars_%E2%80%93_Betsy_Ross.svg/23px-US_flag_13_stars_%E2%80%93_Betsy_Ross.svg.png","/wiki/United_States","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Flag_of_New_York.svg/23px-Flag_of_New_York.svg.png","/wiki/New_York_Provincial_Company_of_Artillery","/wiki/United_States","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Grand_Union_Flag.svg/23px-Grand_Union_Flag.svg.png","/wiki/Continental_Army","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Flag_of_the_United_States_Army_%281775%29.gif/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States_Army_%281775%29.gif","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/Militia_(United_States)","/wiki/File:Army-USA-OF-07.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Army-USA-OF-07.svg/22px-Army-USA-OF-07.svg.png","/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)","/wiki/Commanding_General_of_the_United_States_Army","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","/wiki/Battle_of_Harlem_Heights","/wiki/Battle_of_White_Plains","/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton","/wiki/Battle_of_Princeton","/wiki/Battle_of_Monmouth","/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown","/wiki/Quasi-War","/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States","#cite_note-FOOTNOTELind199441.E2.80.932._.22The_only_non-native_among_the_Founding_Fathers_..C2.A0..C2.A0._As_an_immigrant.2C_Hamilton_lacked_any_ties_to_a_particular_region_that_might_have_qualified_his_intense_devotion_to_the_American_nation_in_its_entirety.22-1","/wiki/Presidency_of_George_Washington","/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Federalist_Party","/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party","/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson","/wiki/James_Madison","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","#cite_note-chernow90-2","/wiki/Aide-de-camp","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion","/wiki/XYZ_Affair","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Quasi-War","/wiki/Columbia_University","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War","/wiki/Continental_Congress","/wiki/Bank_of_New_York","/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation","/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_(1786)","/wiki/Philadelphia_Convention","/wiki/Federalist_Papers","/wiki/Constitutional_interpretation","#cite_note-4","/wiki/George_Washington","/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/Implied_powers","/wiki/National_debt","/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Tariff_in_American_history","/wiki/Excise_tax","/wiki/Whiskey_tax","/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Reynolds_sex_scandal","/wiki/John_adams","/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson","/wiki/Aaron_Burr","/wiki/Electoral_college","/wiki/Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel","#Childhood_in_the_Caribbean","#Education","#During_the_Revolutionary_War","#Early_military_career","#Washington.27s_staff","#Hamilton_enters_Congres
