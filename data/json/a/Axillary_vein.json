There is one axillary vein on each\nside of the body.\n\nIts origin is at the lower margin of the teres major muscle and a continuation\nof the brachial vein.\n\nIts tributaries include the basilic vein and cephalic vein, which are both\nsuperficial veins. It terminates at the lateral margin of the first rib, at\nwhich it becomes the subclavian vein.\n\nIt is accompanied along its course by a similarly named artery, the\naxillary artery.\n","linknr":290,"url":"Axillary_vein","recorded":1362673941,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Veins of the torso","Veins of the upper limb"],"headings":["Additional images","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Gray576.png/250px-Gray576.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Gray821.png/61px-Gray821.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Slide5bbbb.JPG/120px-Slide5bbbb.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Slide4EEEE.JPG/120px-Slide4EEEE.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Heart_normal.svg/32px-Heart_normal.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Basilic_vein","Cephalic_vein","Axilla","Basilic_vein","Brachial_veins","Cephalic_vein","Subclavian_vein","Axillary_artery","Human_anatomy","Blood_vessel","Blood","Anatomical_terms_of_location","Thorax","Axilla","Upper_limb","Heart","Teres_major_muscle","Brachial_vein","Basilic_vein","Cephalic_vein","Superficial_vein","Rib","Subclavian_vein","Artery","Axillary_artery"]}
