It is located about\n30 km southeast of the Aldabra Atoll and is part of the Aldabra Group. It\nis a single coral island which measures 11.07 kmÂ² in area and which has a\nsmall settlement on the sheltered western side, surrounded by Casuarina trees.\nAn abandoned coconut palm plantation is just south of it. There is a concrete\nrunway that runs from between the two sand dunes on the southeast to the\nsettlement. The western shore features an almost uninterruptend sandy beach of\n5 km. Two large sand dunes are prominent on the southeastern coast of the\nisland, one of them 32 m high.\n\nDue to the devastating effect of guano mining which lasted until 1983, the\nisland is dominated by expanses of bare rock and caves, and is sparsely covered\nwith low-growing vegetation.\n\nA notable feature of this island is the Assumption Island day gecko, a\nsubspecies of gecko found only on this island.\n\nPossible legendary Hiding place of Captain Kidds Treasure.\n\nThe documentary [[The Silent World]] was partially shot on Assumption.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Assumption_Island","recorded":1362585456,"links":25,"instances":["seychelles"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Islands of Seychelles","Coral islands"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Assumption_Island.JPG/150px-Assumption_Island.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Flag_of_Seychelles.svg/30px-Flag_of_Seychelles.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["outer_islands","seychelles"]],"members":["outer_islands"],"related":["Indian_Ocean","Madagascar","Seychelles","Aldabra","Aldabra_Group","Casuarina","Coconut","Concrete","Runway","Sand_dune","Guano","Assumption_Island_day_gecko","Subspecies","Gecko","Documentary_film","Outer_Islands_(Seychelles)","Geography_of_Seychelles"]}
