His hypothesis was controversial and not widely accepted until the\n1950s, when numerous discoveries such as palaeomagnetism provided strong\nsupport for continental drift, and thereby a substantial basis for today's\nmodel of Plate tectonics. Wegener was\ninvolved in several expeditions to Greenland to study polar air circulation\nbefore the existence of the jet stream was accepted. Expedition participants\nmade many meteorological observations and achieved the first-ever overwintering\non the inland Greenland ice sheet as well as the first-ever boring of ice cores\non a moving Arctic glacier.\n","linknr":385,"url":"Alfred_Wegener","recorded":1362372884,"links":81,"instances":["martian_crater","physics","berlin","meteorite"],"pdf":["http://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/News/Print_Products/PDF/Flyer/A.%20Wegener_Biografie_6-09_dt.pdf","http://www2.uibk.ac.at/downloads/oegg/Band_73_237_254.pdf","http://www2.uibk.ac.at/downloads/oegg/Band_73_237_254.pdf","http://www.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/News/Print_Products/PDF/252-265_Kap12.pdf"],"categories":["German
