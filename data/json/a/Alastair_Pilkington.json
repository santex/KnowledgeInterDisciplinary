{"cursor":"2782","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Lionel Alexander Bethune Pilkington', (7 January 1920 â 5 May 1995) ('Sir\nAlastair Pilkington') and his associate Kenneth Bickerstaff, both of Great\nBritain, developed the world's first commercially successful manufacture of high\nquality flat glass using their float glass process. American inventors had tried\nseveral times to achieve an improved and lower-cost process to replace the\ncostly plate glass, but had not succeeded. His breakthrough, in which the molten\nglass was 'floated' over a bath of molten tin and manipulated to achieve the\nrequired product thickness, enabled the UK-based Pilkington Glass company to\nlead the world market for high quality flat glass for many years.\nStarting in the early 1960s, all the world's leading flat glass manufacturers\nobtained licences to use the float glass process.\n\nPilkington was chairman of Pilkington Glass from 1973 until 1985, prior to which\nhe had been the company's technical director. Alastair Pilkington was not a\nrelative of Pilkington Glass' founders.\n\nHe was educated at Sherborne School and Trinity College, Cambridge and knighted\nin 1970. He was also a director of the Bank of England.\n","linknr":279,"url":"Alastair_Pilkington","recorded":1362481692,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["English inventors","1920 births","1995 deaths","People educated at Sherborne School","Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge","Glass makers","Fellows of the Royal Society","Knights Bachelor"],"headings":["Footnotes & References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg/45px-Nuvola_apps_kcmsystem.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Cocktail_Glass_%28Cosmopolitan%29.svg/30px-Cocktail_Glass_%28Cosmopolitan%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Float_glass","Plate_glass","Pilkington_Glass","Sherborne_School","Trinity_College,_Cambridge","Bank_of_England","Pilkington_Glass"]}
