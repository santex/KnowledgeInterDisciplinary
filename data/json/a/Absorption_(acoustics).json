{"cursor":"6434","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Acoustic 'absorption' refers to a material, structure or object absorbing sound\nenergy when sound waves collide with it, as opposed to reflecting the energy.\nPart of the absorbed energy is transformed into heat and part is transmitted.\nThe energy transformed into heat is said to have been 'lost'. When sound\nfrom a loudspeaker collides with the walls of a room part of the sound's energy\nis reflected and part is absorbed into the walls. As the waves travel through\nthe wall they deform the material thereof (just like they deformed the air\nbefore). This deformation has mechanical losses which convert part of the sound\nenergy into heat through acoustic attenuation, mostly due to the wall's\nviscosity. The same attenuating mechanics apply for the air and any other medium\nthrough which sound travels. The fraction of sound absorbed is governed by\nthe acoustic impedances of both media and is a function of frequency and the\nincident angle. Size and shape can influence the sound wave's\nbehavior if they interact with its wavelength, giving rise to wave phenomena\nsuch as standing waves and diffraction.\n\nAcoustic absorption is of particular interest in soundproofing.\nSoundproofing aims to absorb as much sound energy (often in particular\nfrequencies) as possible converting it into heat or transmitting it away\nfrom a certain location.\n\nIn general soft, pliable, porous materials like cloths serve as good acoustic\ninsulators absorbing most sound. Whereas dense, hard, impenetrable materials\nlike metals reflect most.\n\nHow well a room absorbs sound is quantified by the effective absorption area of\nthe walls, also named total absorption area. This is calculated using its\ndimensions and the absorption coefficients of the walls. {{cite web |url =\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/acoustic/revmod.html#c2 |title =\nSound Absorption Coefficient}} The total absorption is expressed in Sabin\nand is useful in for instance determining the reverberation time of auditoria.\nAbsorption coefficients can be measured using a reverberation room, which is the\nopposite of an anechoic chamber (see below).\n","linknr":148,"url":"Absorption_(acoustics)","recorded":1362890786,"links":21,"instances":["physical","unit","device","phenomenon","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acoustics"],"headings":["Applications","Electrical and mechanical analogy","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Anechoic_chamber.jpg/200px-Anechoic_chamber.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reflection","physics"],["reflection","physics"],["sabin","unit"],["echo","phenomenon"],["spring","device"],["compression","physical"]],"members":["compression","sabin","spring","echo","reflection"],"related":["Acoustics","Sound_energy","Sound","Reflection_(physics)","Heat","Reflection_(physics)","Acoustic_attenuation","Transmission_medium","Acoustic_impedance","Wave","Standing_wave","Diffraction","Soundproofing","Attenuation_coefficient","Sabin_(unit)","Auditorium","Reverberation_room","Soundproofing","Sound_recording_and_reproduction","Loudspeaker","Acoustic_transmission_lines","Room_acoustics","Architectural_acoustics","Sonar","Anechoic_chamber","Echo_(phenomenon)","Sound_pressure_level","Dissipation","Resistor","Dashpot","Bulk_modulus","Capacitor","Inductor","Spring_(device)","Compression_(physical)","Rarefaction","Adiabatic","Acoustic_impedance","Impedance_matching","Soundproofing","Acoustic_attenuation","Attenuation_coefficient","Anechoic_chamber","Acoustic_wave","Acoustic_impedance"]}
