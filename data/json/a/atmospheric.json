An atmosphere may be retained for a longer duration, if the gravity\nis high and the atmosphere's temperature is low. Some planets consist mainly of\nvarious gases, but only their outer layer is their atmosphere.\n\nThe term stellar atmosphere describes the outer region of a star, and typically\nincludes the portion starting from the opaque photosphere outwards. Relatively\nlow-temperature stars may form compound molecules in their outer atmosphere.\nEarth's atmosphere, which contains oxygen used by most organisms for respiration\nand carbon dioxide used by plants, algae and cyanobacteria for photosynthesis,\nalso protects living organisms from genetic damage by solar ultraviolet\nradiation. Its current composition is the product of billions of years of\nbiochemical modification of the paleoatmosphere by living organisms.\n","linknr":412,"url":"atmospheric","recorded":1362669283,"links":109,"instances":["sediment","moon","meteorology","moon","unit","optics","physiology","planet","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Atmosphere|","Planetary science","Planetary atmospheres"],"headings":["Pressure","Escape","Composition","Structure","Circulation","Importance","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/PIA04866_modest.jpg/220px-PIA04866_modest.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg/290px-Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg/32px-Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg/76px-Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["opacity","optics"],["respiration","physiology"],["atmosphere","unit"],["pascal","unit"],["titan","moon"],["triton","moon"],["titan","moon"],["triton","moon"],["mercury","planet"],["europa","moon"],["io","moon"],["enceladus","moon"],["io","moon#atmosphere"],["callisto","moon#atmosphere_and_ionosphere"],["europa","moon#atmosphere"],["ganymede","moon#atmosphere_and_ionosphere"],["enceladus","moon#cryovolcanism"],["titania","moon#atmosphere"],["deposition","sediment"],["precipitation","meteorology"]],"members":["deposition","callisto","ganymede","europa","titan","precipitation","titania","triton","pascal","opacity","respiration","mercury","enceladus","atmosphere","io"],"related":["Great_Red_Spot","Greek_language","Gas","Mass","Gravity","Planet","Stellar_atmosphere","Opacity_(optics)","Photosphere","Earth's_atmosphere","Oxygen","Organism","Respiration_(physiology)","Carbon_dioxide","Plants","Algae","Cyanobacteria","Photosynthesis","Sunlight","Ultraviolet","Radiation","Paleoatmosphere","Atmospheric_pressure","Force","Atmosphere_(unit)","Pascal_(unit)","Dyne","Pounds_per_square_inch","Irrational_number","Scale_height","Molecular_mass","Surface_gravity","Jupiter","Hydrogen","Helium","Thermal_motion","Escape_velocity","Titan_(moon)","Triton_(moon)","Pluto","Interstellar_planet","Kinetic_energy","Molecular_mass","Venus","Mars","Photodissociation","Ultraviolet","Earth","Magnetic_field","Atmospheric_escape","Solar_wind","Impact_event","Weathering","Regolith","Polar_ice_cap","Earth","Space","Solar_nebula","Venus","Mars","Carbon_dioxide","Nitrogen","Argon","Oxygen","Earth_atmosphere","Gas_giant","Jupiter","Saturn","Uranus","Neptune","Molecular_mass","Titan_(moon)","Triton_(moon)","Nitrogen","Pluto","Solar_System","Moon","Sodium","Mercury_(planet)","Europa_(moon)","Io_(moon)","Sulfur","Enceladus_(moon)","Extra-solar_planet","Hubble_Space_Telescope","HD_209458","Constellation","Pegasus","Earth's_atmosphere","Troposphere","Planetary_boundary_layer","Stratosphere","Ozone_layer","Mesosphere","Thermosphere","Ionosphere","Exosphere","Magnetosphere","Lapse_rate","Ozone_layer","Ultraviolet","Kármán_line","Outer_space","Magnetosphere","Atmosphere_of_Mercury","Atmosphere_of_Venus","Earth's_atmosphere","Atmosphere_of_the_Moon","Atmosphere_of_Mars","Atmosphere_of_Jupiter","Atmosphere_of_Saturn","Atmospheric_evolution_of_Titan","Atmosphere_of_Uranus","Atmosphere_of_Triton","Atmosphere_of_Pluto","HD_209458_b","Convection","Thermal_radiation","Jupiter","Geologist","Comparative_anatomy","Planet","Wind","Dust","Terrain","Deposition_(sediment)","Aeolian_processes","Frost_line","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Meteorologist","Climate","Biologist","Evolution","Atmometer","Edge_of_space","Ionosphere","Sky","Stellar_atmosphere","Table_of_global_climate_system_components"]}
