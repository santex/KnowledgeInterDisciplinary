{"cursor":"7548","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In pharmacology (and more specifically pharmacokinetics), 'absorption' is the\nmovement of a drug into the bloodstream.\n\nAbsorption involves several phases. First, the drug needs to be introduced via\nsome route of administration (oral, topical-dermal, etc.) and in a specific\ndosage form such as a tablet, capsule, solution and so on.\n\nIn other situations, such as intravenous therapy, intramuscular injection,\nenteral nutrition and others, absorption is even more straightforward and there\nis less variability in absorption and bioavailability is often near 100%. It is\nconsidered that intravascular administration (e.g. IV) does not involve\nabsorption, and there is no loss of drug. Kaplan Pharmacology 2010, page6,\nAbsorption The fastest route of absorption is inhalation, and not as\nmistakenly considered the intravenous administration. Kaplan Pharmacology\n2010, Video Lectues, Absorption chapter\n\nAbsorption is a primary focus in drug development and medicinal chemistry, since\nthe drug must be absorbed before any medicinal effects can take place. Moreover,\nthe drug's pharmacokinetic profile can be easily and significantly changed by\nadjusting factors that affect absorption.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)","recorded":1362666456,"links":12,"instances":["chemistry","medicine","pharmacy","pharmacy","materials_science","chemistry","pharmacy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacokinetics"],"headings":["Dissolution","Ionization","Other factors","References","External links","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/c/f4c6ce3bfdd540fad9e7c36a95b74a74.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/a/0/4a0b1012a333733d9d8712efcb6b62c0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/1/c/71c804b2b094a71b01b1c59b12c38514.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tablet","pharmacy"],["capsule","pharmacy"],["solution","pharmacy"],["compliance","medicine"],["polymorphism","materials_science"],["base","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"],["analog","chemistry"]],"members":["base","compliance","solution","capsule","polymorphism","analog","tablet"],"related":["Pharmacology","Pharmacokinetics","Route_of_administration","Mouth","Skin","Dosage_form","Tablet_(pharmacy)","Capsule_(pharmacy)","Solution_(pharmacy)","Intravenous_therapy","Intramuscular_injection","Nasogastric_intubation","Bioavailability","Intravascular","Inhalation","Drug_development","Medicinal_chemistry","Esophagus","Stomach","Compliance_(medicine)","Noyesâ€“Whitney_equation","Surface_area","Diffusion","Coefficient","Diffusion_layer","Micronization","Specific_surface_area","Polymorphism_(materials_science)","Enteric_coating","Base_(chemistry)","Gastrointestinal_tract","Epithelium","Circulatory_system","Cell_membrane","Lipid_bilayer","Semipermeable_membrane","Ionization","Henderson-Hasselbalch_equation","Weak_acid","Aspirin","Cell_membrane","Stomach","Base_(chemistry)","Caffeine","Analog_(chemistry)","Prodrug","Pharmacodynamic"]}
