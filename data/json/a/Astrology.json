{"cursor":"68945","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Astrology' consists of a number of belief systems which hold that there is a\nrelationship between astronomical phenomena and events in the human world. In\nthe West, astrology most often consists of a system of horoscopes that claim to\nexplain aspects of a person's personality and predict future events in their\nlife based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other planetary objects at the\ntime of their birth. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical\nevents, and the Indians, Chinese, and Mayans developed elaborate systems for\npredicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.\n\nAmong Indo-European peoples, astrology has been dated to the third millennium\nBCE, with roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to\ninterpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Through\nmost of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was\naccepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other\nstudies, such as astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in\nastronomy and physics (such as heliocentrism and Newtonian mechanics) called\nastrology into question, and subsequent controlled studies failed to confirm its\npredictive value. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and\ncommon belief in astrology has largely declined.\n\nAstrology is a pseudoscience, and as such has been rejected by the scientific\ncommunity as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific\ntesting of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to\nsupport any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological\ntraditions. Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions, it has been\nfalsified. There is no proposed mechanism of action by which\nthe positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on\nEarth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and\nphysics.\n*
