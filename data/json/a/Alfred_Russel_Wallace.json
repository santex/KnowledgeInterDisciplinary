He is\nbest known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural\nselection, which prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own ideas in On the\nOrigin of Species. Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the Amazon River\nbasin and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the Wallace Line\nthat divides the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts, a western\nportion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion\nwhere the birds and mammals are more similar to those of Australia. He was\nconsidered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of\nanimal species and is sometimes called the \"father of biogeography\".\nWallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and\nmade many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides\nbeing co-discoverer of natural selection. These included the concept of warning\ncolouration in animals, and the Wallace effect, a hypothesis on how natural\nselection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of\nbarriers against hybridization.\n\nWallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas. His advocacy of\nspiritualism and his belief in a non-material origin for the higher mental\nfaculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the\nscientific establishment. In addition to his scientific work, he was a social\nactivist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and\neconomic system in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history\nresulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns\nover the environmental impact of human activity. Wallace was a prolific author\nwho wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures\nand observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia,\n[[The Malay Archipelago]], is regarded as probably the best of all journals of\nscientific exploration published during the 19th century.\n\nWallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His Amazon and\nfar-eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and,\nafter he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in\nunsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications\nhe produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific\ncommunity, such as Darwin and Charles Lyell, he had no family wealth to fall\nback on and he was unsuccessful in finding a long term salaried position,\nreceiving no regular income until a small government pension was obtained for\nhim by Darwin in 1881.\n","linknr":1138,"url":"Alfred_Russel_Wallace","recorded":1362483138,"links":89,"instances":["thurrock","amazon","historical","philosophy_of_mind","commonwealth","biology","historian_of_science","religious_movement","historic","journalist"],"pdf":["http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070605063504/http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf","http://oldweb.northampton.ac.uk/aps/env/lbrg/journals/papers/OllertonHeredityCommentary2005.pdf","http://www.cm.sarawak.gov.my/cm/cmweb.nsf/0/47186e7957e667b64825706600087643/$FILE/St140705.pdf","http://www.cm.sarawak.gov.my/cm/cmweb.nsf/0/47186e7957e667b64825706600087643/$FILE/St140705.pdf","http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletsystbiodiv.pdf"],"categories":["Biogeographers","English
