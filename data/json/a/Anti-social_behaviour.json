This\nis opposed to pro-social behaviour, which is behaviour that helps or benefits\nthe society. Criminal and civil laws in various\ncountries offer remedies for anti-social behaviour. Antisocial behaviour is\nlabeled as such when it is deemed contrary to prevailing norms for social\nconduct. This encompasses a large spectrum of actions. Murder, rape, use of\nillegal substances, and a wide variety of activities are deemed anti-social\nbehaviours. In addition to actions that oppose established law, anti-social\nactions also include activities that members of society ï¬nd objectionable even\nif they are legal, such as drunkenness and sexual promiscuity. In psychiatry,\nparticularly in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\npersistent anti-social behaviour is part of a diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder\n(ASPD).
