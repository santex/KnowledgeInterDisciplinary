Oxford English Dictionary: Edge-\ntool, edged-tool.</ref> dating back to the stone age. Adzes are used for\nsmoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, similar to an axe but with the\nhead mounted perpendicular to the handle. Two basic forms of an adze are the\nhand adze, a short handled tool swung with one hand, and a foot adz, a long\nhandled tool capable of powerful swings using both hands - the cutting edge\nusually striking at foot or shin level. The blade of an adze is set at right\nangles to the tool's shaft (like a hoe or plane), unlike the blade of an axe\nwhich is set in line with the shaft. A very similar (but blunt) tool used for\ndigging in hard ground is called a mattock.\n","title":"Adze","headings":["History","Modern adzes","See also","Footnotes and references"]},"micro-relation":["2: Axe","1: Stone_age","1: Wood","1: Woodworking","1: Mattock","1: Knapping","1: Flint","1: Mesolithic","1: Ground_stone","1: Amphibolite","1: Basalt","1: Jadeite","1: Shoe-last","1: Shoe-last_celt","1: Linear_Pottery_culture","1: RÃ¶ssen_culture","1: Neolithic","1: Mekong","1: Old_Kingdom","1: Predynastic_Egypt","1: Egyptian_hieroglyphs","1: Manuel_de_Codage","1: Opening_of_the_mouth_ceremony","1: Foreleg_of_ox","1: Africa","1: MÄori_culture","1: New_Zealand","1: Wood_carving","1: Nephrite","1: Jade","1: Polynesia","1: Limestone","1: Crooked_knife","1: Irian_Jaya","1: Papua_New_Guinea","1: Melanesia","1: Micronesia","1: Machete","1: Steel","1: Colonial_Williamsburg","1: Virginia","1: Sawmill","1: Ice_axe","1: Halligan_bar","1: Wainwright","1: Mauna_Kea_Adz_Quarry","1: Quicksilver_Wiki"]}
