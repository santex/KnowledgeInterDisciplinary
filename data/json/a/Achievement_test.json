The most common\ntype of achievement test is a standardized test developed to measure skills and\nknowledge learned in a given grade level, usually through planned instruction,\nsuch as training or classroom instruction.

Retrieved\nJune 11, 2007, from\nhttp://faculty.uwstout.edu/lawlerm/at101/glossary.shtml Achievement tests\nare often contrasted with tests that measure aptitude, a more general and stable\ncognitive trait.\n\nAchievement test scores are often used in an educational system to determine\nwhat level of instruction for which a student is prepared. High achievement\nscores usually indicate a mastery of grade-level material, and the readiness for\nadvanced instruction. Low achievement scores can indicate the need for\nremediation or repeating a course grade.\n\nUnder No Child Left Behind, achievement tests have taken on an additional role\nof assessing proficiency of students. Proficiency is defined as the amount of\ngrade-appropriate knowledge and skills a student has acquired up to the point of\ntesting. Better teaching practices are expected to increase the amount learned\nin a school year, and therefore to increase achievement scores, and yield more\n\"proficient\" students than before.\n\nWhen writing achievement test items, writers usually begin with a list of\ncontent standards (either written by content specialists or based on state-\ncreated content standards) which specify exactly what students are expected to\nlearn in a given school year. The goal of item writers is to create test items\nthat measure the most important skills and knowledge attained in a given grade-\nlevel. The number and type of test items written is determined by the grade-\nlevel content standards. Content validity is determined by the\nrepresentativeness of the items included on the final test.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Achievement_test","recorded":1362684070,"links":12,"instances":["student_assessment"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Achievement tests","Educational assessment and evaluation"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["test","student_assessment"],["test","student_assessment"]],"members":["test"],"related":["Test_(student_assessment)","Standardized_test","Aptitude","Cognitive","Test_score","No_Child_Left_Behind","Proficiency","Content_standards","Content_validity","Math-Verbal_Achievement_Gap","Psychological_testing","Test_(student_assessment)","High_stakes_test"]}
