The term can be applied to various properites (e.g. value,\nquantity, image, description) that are nearly but not exactly correct; similar,\nbut not exactly the same.\n\nAlthough approximation is most often applied to numbers, it is also frequently\napplied to such things as mathematical functions, shapes, and physical laws.\n\nIn science, approximation can refer to using a simpler process or model when the\ncorrect model is difficult to use. An approximate model is used to make\ncalculations easier. Approximations might also be used if incomplete information\nprevents use of exact representations.\n\nThe type of approximation used depends on the available information, the degree\nof accuracy required, the sensitivity of the problem to this data, and the\nsavings (usually in time and effort) that can be achieved by approximation.\n","title":"Approximation","headings":["Mathematics","Science","Unicode","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Information","2: Fitness_approximation","2: ≃","2: Congruence_relation","1: Number","1: Shape","1: Physical_law","1: Approximation_theory","1: Functional_analysis","1: Diophantine_approximation","1: Real_number","1: Rational_number","1: Irrational_number","1: Pi","1: Significant_figures","1: Round-off_error","1: Logarithm","1: Asymptotic_analysis","1: History_of_science","1: Correspondence_principle","1: Physicists","1: Earth","1: Sphere","1: Gravity","1: Iteration","1: Perturbation_theory","1: Philosophy_of_science","1: Measurement","1: Mathematical_model","1: Newtonian_mechanics","1: Unicode","1: ≅","1: Isomorphism","1: ∼","1: Japanese_language","1: Korean_language","1: Approximately_equals_sign","1: Approximation_error","1: Estimation","1: Fermi_estimate","1: Least_squares","1: Linear_approximation","1: Newton's_method","1: Numerical_analysis","1: Orders_of_approximation","1: Runge–Kutta_methods","1: Successive_approximation_ADC","1: Taylor_series"]}
