He is\n15th direct descendant of Abdul Qadir Jilani, the Cardinal Sufi Saint in Sufi\nIslam. Al Gillani was chosen in 1920 to head the Iraqi Council of Ministers\nfollowing the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. He used his influence to oppose\nthe appointment of Faisal I as King of Iraq and resigned his post when his\nefforts were defeated. Nevertheless, Faisal reappointed him as prime minister in\norder to curb opposition.\n\nIn 1922 Gillani negotiated the first Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which ensured nominal\nindependence for the country, though Britain maintained control of the military\nand foreign affairs, essentially establishing a Mandate in the country. Opposed\nto these results, Gillani resigned shortly after.\n\nPercy Cox states in page 128 of the HAND BOOK OF MESOPOTAMIA that he was the\nmost influential \"Sunni\" and official head of the Arab Community. He continues,\n\"It is worthy of note that extreme deference is paid to the Naqeeb of Baghdad\nand his family by many of the most influential and wealthy as well as the humble\nand poorest, of Indian and Afghan Muslims\".\n\nWhen chosen by the British to head the government, it was felt doubtful that he\nwould accept, in view of his old age, ill health and habitual seclusion, and a\nstatement in an interview declaring his reluctance to take part in political\nactivities, even if it would save IRAQ from disaster. The British\nAdministration, however, persuaded him to accept. This is portrayed by Gertrude\nBell, who writes:\n\nIn came Mr. Philby and others and on top of them Sir Percy. Every\none but Mr. Philby melted away, and we two turned to Sir Percy breathless with\nexcitement. âWell he said, he has acceptedâ. He had come straight from the\nNaqeeb who had agreed to undertake the formation of the Provisional Government.\nSo the first success is scored and not one but Sir Percy could have done it.\nIndeed, that even he should have inducted the Naqeeb to take a hand in Public\naffairs is nothing short of a miracle {{cite book |title=Iraq: A Study in\nPolitical Development |first=Philip Willard |last=Ireland |page=82\n}}\n\nDespite the formation of the Council of Ministers, the question as to the form\nof permanent Government and of the person of its ruler was constantly under\ndiscussion in the Coffee houses, in the tents of the Sheikhs, or wherever Iraqis\nmet in social and political gatherings.\n\nIt is reported that the throne was offered to the Naqeeb of Baghdad, but under\nsuch conditions and limitations as would have made him, in his own words no more\nthan an \"Iraqi Rajah\". He himself never sought it and felt that if it had been\nfreely offered to him by the people he would be obliged to accept the honor and\nthe duties (Ireland, p. 304).\n\nDuring another interview with Bell, replying to a question regarding his or one\nof his sons' candidatures for Sharaf or Emir of Mesopotamia, he said,\n\"I am a relative of the Sharaf. I come of the same stock and I share\nthe same religious opinion, you therefore understand that I am not actuated by\ndifference of blood, of thought when I tell you that I would never consent to\nthe appointment of myself or of my sons as Emir. The Hejaz is one and Iraq is\none. There is no connection between them but that of faith. Our politics, out\ntrade, our agriculture is all different from those of Hejaz. The Hejaz is the\nHoly Land of Islam. It must remain a separate and independent state by which all\nMuslims can profit\".\n\nHe was asked again, \"If for political reasons it were necessary to put an Emir\nat the head of Iraq would you accept the responsibility with British help and\nsupport\"? He said, \"Can you put a question as that to me? I am a\nDarwesh, concern is not with the things of this world. It would be contrary to\nthe deepest principles of my creed to become the political head of the state. In\nthe time of my ancestor, Syed Abdul Qadir al Gillani, the Abbasid Caliphs were\naccustomed to consult him as you and your colleagues consult me, but he would\nnever have consented to take an active part in public affairs. Neither would I,\nnor any of his descendants consent to do so. This is my answer on the ground of\nreligion, but I will give you also an answer, based on personal reason I am an\nold man. These five or six years of life, which remain to me, I wish to spend in\nreflection and study. When you came today, I kept you waiting. I was busy with\nmy books. They are my constant preoccupation\". {{cite book |first =Arnold\n|last=Wilson |authorlink=A._T._Wilson |title=A clash of Loyalties Vol. II\nMesopotamia 1917-20 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1931\n}}\n\nHe was a scholar, and his personal Library consisted of 36,000 books on various\nsubjects. Of these, about 2,000 were manuscripts. The Present Makteba Qadiria\n(Qadri Library) is in fact, the altered name of his personal library. A 700-year-\nold copy of the Quran written in gold was, after his death, presented to the\nKing Idris of Libya, by Pir Ibrahim Saif-ud-din, who became Naqeeb after the son\nof Syed Abd al-Rahman passed.\n\nAmong his grandsons are Pir Sayed Tahir Allauddin; Sayed Ahmed Zafar al-Jilani,\nthe elder brother of Pir Sayed Tahir Allauddin and the Naqeeb of Iraq , who\nblessed Shaykh Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin in 2007, Deputy of Shaykh Nazim al-\nQubrusi, and advised him to work uplift relations between Westerners and\nMuslims, Arabs, and the people of\nIraq.
