This\nenzyme was first described in 1964 as a pteridine-dependent etherlipid cleaving\nenzyme. In 2010 finally, the gene coding for alkylglycerol\nmonooxygenase was discovered as transmembrane protein 195 (TMEM195) on\nchromosome 7. In analogy to the enzymes phenylalanine hydroxylase,\ntyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase and nitric oxide synthase,\nalkylglycerol monooxygenase critically depends on the cofactor\ntetrahydrobiopterin and iron.\n\nThe reaction catalyzed by alkylglycerol monooxygenase:\n\n* 1-alkyl-sn-glycerol + tetrahydrobiopterin + O 2\n  \\rightleftharpoons 1-hydroxyalkyl-sn-glycerol + 6,7[8H]-\n  dihydrobiopterin + H 2O\n\nThe unstable intermediate product 1-hydroxyalkyl-sn-glycerol rearranges into the\nfatty aldehyde and the free glycerol derivative. The fatty aldehyde is then\nfurther oxidized to the corresponding acid by fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase.\n\n{| \n|}\n\nAlkylglycerol monooxygenase is a membrane-bound mixed-function oxidase and\nharbours a fatty acid hydroxylase motif. The iron is believed to be coordinated\nby a diiron center composed of eight histidines, which can be found in all\nenzymes containing this motif.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Alkylglycerol_monooxygenase","recorded":1362511022,"links":13,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 1.14.16","Phospholipid enzymes","Enzymes of unknown structure"],"headings":["Nomenclature","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/e/ebe1915c432cf9c372b4ecfe36ff1fa2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"]],"members":["cofactor"],"related":["Ether_lipid","Enzyme","Chromosome","Phenylalanine_hydroxylase","Tyrosine_hydroxylase","Tryptophan_hydroxylase","Nitric_oxide_synthase","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Tetrahydrobiopterin","Iron","Catalysis","Fatty_aldehyde_dehydrogenase","Mixed-function_oxidase","Histidine"]}
