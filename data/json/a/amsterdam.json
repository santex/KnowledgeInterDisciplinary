The 17th-century canals of\nAmsterdam (in Dutch: 'grachtengordel'), located in the heart of Amsterdam, were\nadded to the UNESCO World Heritage List in July 2010.\n\nAs the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial\ncentres in Europe, Amsterdam is considered an alpha world city by the\nGlobalization and World Cities (GaWC) study group. The city is also the cultural\ncapital of the Netherlands.<ref>After Athens in 1888 and Florence in 1986,\nAmsterdam was in 1986 chosen as the European Capital of Culture, confirming its\neminent position in Europe and the Netherlands.
