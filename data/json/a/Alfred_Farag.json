He\nobtained his BA in English Literature from the Faculty of Arts, Alexandria\nUniversity in 1949. He took up a teaching career till 1955, when he abandoned it\nfor a post in the press as a literary critic. He worked at several press\ninstitutions, for instance, âRose El Youssefâ, âEl Tahrirâ and âAl Gomhouriyyaâ.\n\nFarag took a part in the establishment of the public management for the âmass\ncultureâ project and in the foundation of artistic groups in Egypt. He also had\nan important role in the introduction of theatre in Egyptâs provinces. He, with\nmany great writers like Noaman Ashour, Saad Eddin Wahba, Michael Roman, Rashad\nRoushdy and Yousef Edrees, contributed in the ânothing likeâ renaissance of\ntheatre in the sixties.\n\nAlfred Farag wrote his first play âFall of Pharaohâ (1957) at the age of 26,\nthen he proceeded his career as a writer. He wrote about 52 plays such as âThe\nBarber of Baghdadâ (1964), âSulayman Al-Halabiâ (1965), âAl-Zayr Salimâ (1967)\nand âAtwa with the Jack-Knifeâ (1993), in addition to some one-act plays such as\nâVoice of Egyptâ (1956) and âThe Trapâ (1965). In his plays, he discusses\nserious issues like the problem of national independence in the âThe Epistles of\nthe Judge of Sevilleâ (1987), and the Palestinian issue in âFire and Olivesâ\n(1970). Some of his works were translated into German and English such as âAli\nJanah Al - Tabrizi and his Servant Quffaâ (1969) or into English only such as\nâMarriage on a Divorce Notificationâ (1973). In addition to being a playwright,\nhe also wrote novels such as âThe Story of the Lost Timeâ (1977) and âThe Days\nand Nights of Sindbadâ (1988), and short stories.\n\nIn his writings, he eloquently mixed the Egyptian Colloquial Arabic with the\nStandard Arabic which made his works unique and easy for people to understand.\nCritics became interested in Farag's dramatic language as it was vivid and far\nfrom the formal style used by his predecessors. He believed that the language\nshould contribute in giving a âvisualâ illustration of the text What made him\ndifferent from others is that he revived the old heritage on stage as if it was\nreal, and that he used heritage without getting superficial.\n\nFarag was granted several international, Arab and Egyptian awards and medals.\nThe best known award was âJerusalemâ given by the General Union for Arab Writers\nas he was the first Egyptian intellectual to receive such an award. He also\nreceived the National Award for Play writing in 1965, and the Science and Arts\nMedal of the first order in 1967.\n\nFarag died on 4 December 2005 at the age of 76 in the St Mary's Hospital, London\nafter a long term of illness. He was buried in Alexandria.\n","linknr":109,"url":"Alfred_Farag","recorded":1375069373,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Zagazig","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/London","/wiki/UK","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Zagazig","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/Alexandria_University","/wiki/Rose_El_Youssef","/w/index.php?title=El_Tahrir&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Al_Gomhouriyya&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Noaman_Ashour&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Saad_Eddin_Wahba&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Michael_Roman&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Rashad_Roushdy&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Yousef_Edrees&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sulayman_Al-Halabi&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Egyptian_Colloquial_Arabic","/w/index.php?title=General_Union_for_Arab_Writers&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Hospital,_London","/wiki/Alexandria","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_Copts","/wiki/Lists_of_Egyptians","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/64810683","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Zagazig","/wiki/Egypt","/wiki/London","/wiki/UK","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&oldid=556169690","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1929_births","/wiki/Category:2005_deaths","/wiki/Category:Egyptian_dramatists_and_playwrights","/wiki/Category:Alexandria_University_alumni","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alfred+Farag&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alfred+Farag","/wiki/Alfred_Farag","/wiki/Talk:Alfred_Farag","#","/wiki/Alfred_Farag","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Alfred_Farag","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Alfred_Farag","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&oldid=556169690","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2918982","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Alfred_Farag&id=556169690","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Alfred+Farag","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Alfred+Farag&oldid=556169690&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Farag&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF_%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%AC","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%93_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%92","//arz.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF_%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%AC","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2918982#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Farag","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org
