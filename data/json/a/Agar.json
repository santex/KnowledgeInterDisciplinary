Agar is a\nmixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide 'agarose', and a\nheterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called 'agaropectin'.\n\nThroughout history into modern times, agar has been chiefly used as an\ningredient in desserts throughout Asia and also as a solid substrate to contain\nculture medium for microbiological work. Agar (agar-agar) can be used as a\nlaxative, an appetite suppressant, vegetarian gelatin substitute, a thickener\nfor soups, in fruit preserves, ice cream, and other desserts, as a clarifying\nagent in brewing, and for sizing paper and fabrics.\n\nThe gelling agent is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls\nof some species of red algae, primarily from the genera [[Gelidium]] and\n[[Gracilaria]], or seaweed (Sphaerococcus euchema). For commercial purposes, it\nis derived primarily from [[Gelidium amansii]]. In chemical terms, agar is a\npolymer made up of subunits of the sugar galactose.\n","linknr":467,"url":"Agar","recorded":1362505816,"links":64,"instances":["biology","fruit_preserves","dental","process"],"pdf":["http://202.114.65.51/fzjx/wsw/newindex/wswfzjs/pdf/580892p425.pdf","http://202.114.65.51/fzjx/wsw/newindex/wswfzjs/pdf/580892p425.pdf"],"categories":["Edible thickening agents","Microbiological gelling agent","Dental materials","Malay words and phrases","Edible algae","Gels","Polysaccharides"],"headings":["Background","Uses","Market Information","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Youkan_mizuyoukan.jpg/250px-Youkan_mizuyoukan.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Agarplate_redbloodcells_edit.jpg/250px-Agarplate_redbloodcells_edit.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Agarose_polymere.svg/220px-Agarose_polymere.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Agar_Plate.jpg/220px-Agar_Plate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Physcomitrella_growing_on_agar_plates.jpg/220px-Physcomitrella_growing_on_agar_plates.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Sago_Gulaman.jpg/220px-Sago_Gulaman.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","biology"],["jelly","fruit_preserves"],["molding","process"],["impression","dental"]],"members":["substrate","jelly","impression","molding"],"related":["Yōkan","Blood_agar","Gelatin","Polysaccharide","Red_algae","Cell_wall","Agarophyte","Desserts","Substrate_(biology)","Growth_medium","Microbiology","Laxative","Vegetarian","Gelatin","Soup","Jelly_(fruit_preserves)","Ice_cream","Brewing","Sizing","Genus","Seaweed","Polymer","Galactose","Hysteresis","Malay_language","German_people","Walther_Hesse","Robert_Koch","Growth_medium","Bacteria","Fungi","Microbe","Axenic","In_vitro","Agar_plate","Petri_dish","Murashige_and_Skoog_medium","Autoclave","Moss","Gellan_gum","Phytohormone","Plant","Cell_culture","Immunodiffusion","Immunoelectrophoresis","Electrophoresis","Agarose_gel_electrophoresis","Size_exclusion_chromatography","Affinity_chromatography","Sago","Pandanus_amaryllifolius","Gelatin","Translucent","Puddings","Custard","Molding_(process)","Aspic","Cake","Japanese_cuisine","Philippine_cuisine","Gulaman","Vietnamese_cuisine","Indian_cuisine","Burmese_cuisine","Pectin","Bird's_milk","Meringue","Impression_(Dental)","Dentistry","Salt_bridge","Electrochemistry","Ant_farm","Kanten_Clay_Studio","Modelling_clay","Agarose_gel_electrophoresis","Algaculture","Anmitsu","Asepsis","Carrageenan","Gulaman","Halo-halo","Immunodiffusion","Immunoelectrophoresis","Kanten_Clay_Studio","Petri_dish","R2a_agar","Rhodophyta","Robert_Koch","SEAgel","Walter_Hesse"]}
