Two zinc ions that are needed for the enzyme to catalyze its reaction are\n  shown as purple spheres, and an enzyme inhibitor called S-hexylglutathione is\n  shown as a space-filling model, filling the two active sites.]]\n\n'Enzymes' () are large biological molecules responsible for the thousands of\nchemical interconversions that sustain life. They are\nhighly selective catalysts, greatly accelerating both the rate and specificity\nof metabolic reactions, from the digestion of food to the synthesis of DNA. Most\nenzymes are proteins, although some catalytic RNA molecules have been\nidentified. Enzymes adopt a specific three-dimensional structure, and may employ\norganic (e.g. biotin) and inorganic (e.g. magnesium ion) cofactors to assist in\ncatalysis.\n\nIn enzymatic reactions, the molecules at the beginning of the process, called\nsubstrates, are converted into different molecules, called products. Almost all\nchemical reactions in a biological cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates\nsufficient for life. Since enzymes are selective for their substrates and speed\nup only a few reactions from among many possibilities, the set of enzymes made\nin a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell.\n\nLike all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy\n(E aâ¡ ) for a reaction, thus dramatically increasing the\nrate of the reaction. As a result, products are formed faster and reactions\nreach their equilibrium state more rapidly. Most enzyme reaction rates are\nmillions of times faster than those of comparable un-catalyzed reactions. As\nwith all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze, nor\ndo they alter the equilibrium of these reactions. However, enzymes do differ\nfrom most other catalysts in that they are highly specific for their substrates.\nEnzymes are known to catalyze about 4,000 biochemical reactions. A\nfew RNA molecules called ribozymes also catalyze reactions, with an important\nexample being some parts of the ribosome. Synthetic\nmolecules called artificial enzymes also display enzyme-like\ncatalysis.\n\nEnzyme activity can be affected by other molecules. Inhibitors are molecules\nthat decrease enzyme activity; activators are molecules that increase activity.\nMany drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. Activity is also affected by\ntemperature, pressure, chemical environment (e.g., pH), and the concentration of\nsubstrate. Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of\nantibiotics. In addition, some household products use enzymes to speed up\nbiochemical reactions (e.g., enzymes in biological washing powders break down\nprotein or fat stains on clothes; enzymes in meat tenderizers break down\nproteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew).\n","linknr":1408,"url":"Apoenzyme","recorded":1362508436,"links":144,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","biology","genetics","genetics","biology","biology","food","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.expasy.org/NAR/enz00.pdf","http://www.expasy.org/NAR/enz00.pdf","http://cmgm3.stanford.edu/biochem/sb241/Herschlag_lectures/papers/Blow.pdf","http://cmgm3.stanford.edu/biochem/sb241/Herschlag_lectures/papers/Blow.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf"],"categories":["Biomolecules","Enzymes|*","Metabolism","Catalysis","Process
