{"cursor":"21544","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Comparative psychology' refers to the scientific study of the behavior and\nmental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the\nphylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior.\nResearch in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different\nmethods, and explores the behavior of many different species, from insects to\nprimates. Papini, M.R. (2003). Comparative\nPsychology. In Handbook of Research Methods in Experimental Psychology. Ed.\nStephen F. Davis. Blackwell. Malden, MA.\n\nComparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species\ncomparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some\nresearchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of\ncomparative psychology and that intense focus on a single organism to understand\nits behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the\nworks of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the\nobject of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality\nfocusing on both proximate and ultimate causation. Dewsbury, D. (1984). Comparative Psychology in the Twentieth Century.\nHutchinson Ross Publishing Company. Stroudsburg, PA.\n\nUsing a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target\nbehavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko\nTinbergen. First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across\nspecies (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one\nmay ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the\nindividuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals\nproducing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? These two\nquestions provide a theory for the ultimate cause of behavior.\n\nThird, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological,\nbehavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the\ngeneration of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development\nof the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social\nexperiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)?\nThese latter two questions provide a theory for the proximate causes of\nbehavior. For more details see Tinbergen's four questions.\n","linknr":488,"url":"Animal_psychology","recorded":1362485195,"links":46,"instances":["dog","chimpanzee","trait","psychology","parrot","activity"],"pdf":["http://www.uga.edu/psychology/primate/pub/Johnson-Pynn,%20Fragaszy%20and%20Sebree%20IJCP%202003.pdf","http://www.uga.edu/psychology/primate/pub/Johnson-Pynn,%20Fragaszy%20and%20Sebree%20IJCP%202003.pdf"],"categories":["Branches of psychology","Social sciences","Behavioural sciences"],"headings":["History","Species studied","Animal cognition","Disorders of animal behavior","Effect of animals on humans","Topics of study","Notable comparative psychologists","Related fields","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Cat_brain.jpg/220px-Cat_brain.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gua","chimpanzee"],["intelligence","trait"],["alex","parrot"],["chaser","dog"],["play","activity"],["imprinting","psychology"]],"members":["chaser","gua","intelligence","imprinting","alex","play"],"related":["Organism","Proximate_and_ultimate_causation","Tinbergen's_four_questions","Social_organization","Animal_communication","Al-Jahiz","Afro-Arab","Psychology_in_medieval_Islam","Ibn_al-Haytham","Zoomusicology","Arabic_music","Ethology","Western_world","Charles_Darwin","George_Romanes","Anthropomorphism","Douglas_Alexander_Spalding","Jacques_Loeb","Sir_John_Lubbock","Lewis_Henry_Morgan","Animal_echolocation","Ivan_Pavlov","Edward_Thorndike","Rat","Pigeon","Primate","Harry_F._Harlow","Maternal_deprivation","Rhesus_monkey","Gua_(chimpanzee)","Intelligence_(trait)","Corvid","African_Gray_Parrot","Dolphin","Alex_(parrot)","Chaser_(dog)","Animal_cognition","Animal_cognition","Pet","Rat","Psychosis","Dog_breed","Huskies","Ethological","Domestication","Animal_locomotion","Hoarding","Play_(activity)","Tonic_immobility","Personal_grooming","Hibernation","Developmental_psychology","Neural","Endocrine","Imprinting_(psychology)","Imitation","Behavior_genetics","Instincts","Motivation","Evolution","Learning","Consciousness","Mind","Aristotle","Frank_Beach","F.J.J._Buytendijk","Charles_Darwin","James_Mark_Baldwin","Allen_Gardner","Beatrix_Gardner","Harry_F._Harlow","Donald_Olding_Hebb","Richard_Herrnstein","L.T._Hobhouse","Clark_L._Hull","Linus_Kline","Wolfgang_Köhler","Konrad_Lorenz","Emil_Wolfgang_Menzel,_Jr.","Neal_E._Miller","C._Lloyd_Morgan","O._Hobart_Mowrer","Robert_Lockhard","Ivan_Pavlov","Irene_Pepperberg","George_Romanes","T._Schjelderup-Ebbe","Sara_Shettleworth","B.F._Skinner","Willard_Small","Edward_C._Tolman","Edward_L._Thorndike","Margaret_Floy_Washburn","John_B._Watson","Wilhelm_Wundt","Animal_cognition","Behavioral_ecology","Operant_conditioning","Ethology","Experimental_analysis_of_behavior","Neuroethology","Physiological_psychology","Psychopharmacology"]}
