{"cursor":"5085","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn chemistry, an 'amphoteric' species is a molecule or ion that can react as an\nacid as well as a base. The word is derived from the Greek word\nmeaning \"both\". Many metals (such as zinc, tin, lead, aluminium, and beryllium)\nand most metalloids form amphoteric oxides or hydroxides. Amphoterism depends on\nthe oxidation state of the oxide.\n\nOne type of amphoteric species are 'amphiprotic' molecules, which can either\ndonate or accept a proton (H +). Examples include amino acids and\nproteins, which have amine and carboxylic acid groups, and self-ionizable\ncompounds such as water and ammonia.\n\n'Ampholytes' are amphoteric molecules that contain both acidic and basic\ngroups and will exist mostly as zwitterions in a certain range of pH. The pH\nat which the average charge is zero is known as the molecule's [[isoelectric\npoint]]. Ampholytes are used to establish a stable pH gradient for use in\nisoelectric focusing.\n","linknr":234,"url":"Amphoteric","recorded":1362512093,"links":52,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties","Acid-base chemistry"],"headings":["Amphoteric oxides and hydroxides<ref>{{Housecroft2nd|pages]173–4}}</ref>","Amphiprotic molecules","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base"],"related":["Chemistry","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Zinc","Tin","Lead","Aluminium","Beryllium","Metalloids","Oxidation_state","Proton","Amino_acid","Protein","Amine","Carboxylic_acid","Molecular_autoionization","Water","Ammonia","Zwitterion","PH","Isoelectric_focusing","Zinc_oxide","Cation","Aluminium_hydroxide","Beryllium_hydroxide","Aluminium_oxide","Lead_oxide","Chromium","Gallium","Copper","Antimony","Bismuth","Indium","Silicon","Titanium","Vanadium","Iron","Cobalt","Germanium","Zirconium","Silver","Tin","Gold","Brønsted-Lowry_theory","Proton","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Water","Amino_acid","Bicarbonate","Hydrogen_sulfate","Hydrogen_chloride","Ammonia","Lewis_acid","Zwitterion","Isoelectric_point","Ate_complex"]}
