Administrative divisions are each\ngranted a certain degree of autonomy, and are required to manage themselves\nthrough their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller\nunits to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For\nexample, a country may be divided into provinces, which in turn are divided into\ncounties, which in turn may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities.\nThese are only a few of the names given to administrative subdivisions; more\nexamples are provided below.\n\nAdministrative divisions are conceptually separate from dependent territories,\nwith the former being an integral part of the state and the other being only\nunder some lesser form of control. However, the term \"administrative division\"\ncan include dependent territories as well as accepted administrative divisions\n(for example, in geographical databases).\n",
