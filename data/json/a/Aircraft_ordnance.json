{"cursor":"1730","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" and ordnance in 1962]] 'Aircraft ordnance' or 'ordnance' (in the context of\n military aviation) is weapons (e.g. bombs, missiles, rockets and gun\n ammunition) used by aircraft. The term is often used when describing the weight\n of air-to-ground weaponry that can be carried by an aircraft or the weight that\n has been dropped. Aircraft ordnance also includes air-to-air, anti-ship and anti-\n submarine weapons.\n\nSome aircraft types can carry a wide variety of ordnance - for example the\nFairchild AU-23 Peacemaker could use forward-firing gun pods, 500 and 250 pound\nbombs, napalm units, cluster bomb units, flares, rockets, smoke grenades and\npropaganda leaflet dispensers. http://www.nati-\nonalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3228\n\nOrdnance can be carried in a bomb bay or hung from a hardpoint.\n\nFor many weapons there is a limit to the length of time they can be flown (e.g.\nbecause of vibration damage); after this their safety or effectiveness is not\nguaranteed. This can be a problem if weapons designed for high intensity\nconflict are carried on multiple missions in a long counter-insurgency campaign.
