{"cursor":"20882","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'abrasive' is a material, often a mineral, that is used to shape or finish a\nworkpiece through rubbing which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away.\nWhile finishing a material often means polishing it to gain a smooth, reflective\nsurface it can also involve roughening as in satin, matte or beaded finishes.\n\nAbrasives are extremely commonplace and are used very extensively in a wide\nvariety of industrial, domestic, and technological applications. This gives rise\nto a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as\nwell as the shape of the abrasive. Common uses for abrasives include grinding,\npolishing, buffing, honing, cutting, drilling, sharpening, lapping, and sanding\n(see abrasive machining). (For simplicity, \"mineral\" in this article will be\nused loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-\nmade or not.)\n\nFiles act by abrasion but are not classed as abrasives as they are a shaped bar\nof metal. However, diamond files are a form of coated abrasive (as they are\nmetal rods coated with diamond powder).\n","linknr":422,"url":"Abrasive","recorded":1362375270,"links":45,"instances":["optics","abrasive_cutting","mechanical","chemistry","tool","optics","geology","mineral"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abrasives|","Materials with minor glass phase","Metalworking","Mineralogy"],"headings":["Mechanics of abrasion","Abrasive minerals","Manufactured abrasives","Choice of abrasive","Other instances of abrasion","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Differences_in_the_size_of_sand.jpg/220px-Differences_in_the_size_of_sand.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Grinding_Wheels.jpg/220px-Grinding_Wheels.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Noe_schleifstein.jpg/220px-Noe_schleifstein.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Schuurpapier2.JPG/220px-Schuurpapier2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Abrasiveness_RDA.JPG/220px-Abrasiveness_RDA.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["grinding","abrasive_cutting"],["file","tool"],["emery","mineral"],["iron(iii_oxide"],["matrix","geology"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["lens","optics"],["transparency","optics"],["abrasion","mechanical"]],"members":["transparency","grinding","abrasion","sublimation","file","lens","matrix","emery"],"related":["Mineral","Polishing","Grinding_(abrasive_cutting)","Buffing","Honing","Cutting","Drilling","Sharpening","Lapping","Sanding","Abrasive_machining","File_(tool)","Glacier","Minerals","Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness","Diamond","Corundum","Bauxite","Calcium_carbonate","Pressure","Swarf","Sharpening_stone","Calcite","Emery_(mineral)","Novaculite","Pumice","Iron(III)_oxide","Sand","Zirconia_alumina","Borazon","Boron_nitride","Aluminium_oxide","Dry_ice","Glass","Steel_abrasives","Silicon_carbide","Bonded_abrasive","Matrix_(geology)","Sinter","Clay","Resin","Rubber","Tungsten_carbide","Garnet","Grinding_wheel","Coolant","Tempering","Rotary_tool","Scale_model","Paper","Cloth","Polyester","Metal","Sandpaper","Belt_grinder","Match","Diamond_plate","Diamond_tools","Copper_slag","Sandblasting","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Cutting_compound","Silver","Optical_media","Toothpaste","Silica","Tooth_enamel","Linoleum","Tile","Laminate","Steel_wool","Scouring_pad","Exfoliation","Almond","Oatmeal","Dermabrasion","Microdermabrasion","DVD","Silicosis","Silicate","Optical_lens","Compact_disc","Knife","Chemical_reactivity","Rust","Jewel_bearing","Piston","Lens_(optics)","Transparency_(optics)","Strop","Razor","Japanese_sword","Superfinishing","Fullerite","Aggregated_diamond_nanorod","Ore","Adhesive","Tire","Inner_tube","Vulcanisation","Cement","Cutting_board","Glass_cutter","Carbon","Internal_combustion_engine","Engineering_tolerance","Engine_oil","Incomplete_combustion","Fullerenes","Abrasion_(mechanical)","Abrasive_blasting","Erosion","Steel_abrasive","Tribology","Wear"]}
