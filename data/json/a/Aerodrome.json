Aerodromes include small\n general aviation airfields, large commercial airports, and military\n airbases. The term airport may imply a certain stature (having satisfied\n certain certification criteria or regulatory requirements) that an aerodrome\n may not have achieved. That is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not\n all aerodromes are airports. Usage of the term 'aerodrome' remains more\n common in the UK and Commonwealth nations, and is conversely almost unknown\n in American English.\n\nA water aerodrome is an area of open water used regularly by seaplanes or\namphibious aircraft for landing and taking off.\n\nAccording to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) an aerodrome\nis \"A defined area on land or water (including any buildings, installations, and\nequipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival,\ndeparture, and surface movement of aircraft.\" International Civil Aviation\nOrganization (ICAO) Documents, Annex 14 to The Convention on International Civil\nAviation (Chicago Convention) ,Volume I- Aerodrome Design and Operations under\nDefinitions\n","linknr":349,"url":"Aerodrome","recorded":1362535334,"links":59,"instances":["canada"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Airfields|","Airports by type"],"headings":["Etymology","History of aerodromes","Types of aerodromes","Aerodromes by country","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Cotswold_airport_at_kemble_from_helicopter_arp.jpg/220px-Cotswold_airport_at_kemble_from_helicopter_arp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Pulkovo_airport.jpg/220px-Pulkovo_airport.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Private_airstrip_at_Knettishall_-_geograph.org.uk_-_243343.jpg/180px-Private_airstrip_at_Knettishall_-_geograph.org.uk_-_243343.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Feuerwehr.JPG/160px-Feuerwehr.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Hahn_Air_Base_aerial_shelters_1977.JPEG/180px-Hahn_Air_Base_aerial_shelters_1977.JPEG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Yellowknife_Water_Aerodrome.jpg/220px-Yellowknife_Water_Aerodrome.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Aviacionavion.png/28px-Aviacionavion.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["minister_of_transport","canada"]],"members":["minister_of_transport"],"related":["Aircraft","Flight","Cargo","General_aviation","Commercial_aviation","Airport","Military_airbase","Water_aerodrome","Seaplane","Amphibious_aircraft","International_Civil_Aviation_Organization","Greek_language","Royal_Flying_Corps","Royal_Air_Force","Canada","Australia","Term_of_art","International_Civil_Aviation_Organization","DHC-4_Caribou","Ju-52","Fieseler_Storch","Knettishall","Soest,_Germany","Hahn_Air_Base","Northwest_Territories","Canada","Aeronautical_Information_Manual","Minister_of_Transport_(Canada)","Nav_Canada","Canadian_Flight_Supplement","Spaceport"]}
