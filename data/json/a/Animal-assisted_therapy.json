{"cursor":"25526","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Animal-assisted therapy' (AAT) is a type of therapy that involves animals as a\nform of treatment. The goal of AAT is to improve a patientâs social, emotional,\nor cognitive functioning. Advocates state that animals can be useful for\neducational and motivational effectiveness for participants. A\ntherapist who brings along a pet may be viewed as being less threatening,\nincreasing the rapport between patient and therapist.\nAnimals used in therapy include domesticated pets, farm animals and marine\nmammals (such as dolphins). While the research literature presents the\nrelationship between humans and companion animals as generally favorable,\nmethodological concerns about the poor quality of the data have led to calls for\nimproved experimental studies. See also: Serpell (1990), Walsh (2009), and\nWilson (2006). Wilsonâs (1984) biophilia hypothesis is based on the\npremise that our attachment to and interest in animals stems from the strong\npossibility that human survival was partly dependent on signals from animals in\nthe environment indicating safety or threat. The biophilia hypothesis suggests\nthat now, if we see animals at rest or in a peaceful state, this may signal to\nus safety, security and feelings of well-being which in turn may trigger a state\nwhere personal change and healing are possible  Schaefer K (2002) Human-\nanimal interactions as a therapeutic intervention Counseling and Human\nDevelopment,\n34(5) pp.1-18.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Animal-assisted_therapy","recorded":1362904297,"links":31,"instances":["therapy_cat"],"pdf":["http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/337/33750210.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental psychology","Human–animal interaction","Outdoor education","Therapy"],"headings":["History","Modern Animal-Assisted Therapy","Benefiting children","Mental Institutions, Hospitals and Nursing Homes","Types of Animal Assisted Therapy","Criticisms of animal-assisted therapy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Therapiehund.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Pies_asystuj%C4%85cy_golden_retriever_2009_pl.jpg/220px-Pies_asystuj%C4%85cy_golden_retriever_2009_pl.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Stella_at_school..jpg/220px-Stella_at_school..jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Therapeutic_horseback_riding_2.JPG/220px-Therapeutic_horseback_riding_2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["oscar","therapy_cat"]],"members":["oscar"],"related":["York_Retreat","William_Tuke","Bethlem_Hospital","Sigmund_Freud","Chow_Chow","Psychoanalysis","Attachment_theory","Schizophrenic","Oscar_(therapy_cat)","Hippotherapy","Therapeutic_horseback_riding","Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder","Autism","Animal_cognition","Animal_consciousness","Cambridge_Declaration_on_Consciousness","Care_farming","Human-canine_bond","Service_animal"]}
