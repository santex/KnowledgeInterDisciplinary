Singer/pianist Mike Patto had\n  assembled a new-look lineup including bassist Tim Bogert from Vanilla Fudge,\n  guitarist Adrian Fisher from Sparks, Chris Stainton from Joe Cocker and many\n  others and drummer Eddie Tuduri from the American band Wha-Koo.\n\nThe album was also released in USA with a different cover.\n\nThere had been rumours that George Martin was interested in working with\nBoxer. The album was eventually produced by Jeff Glixman, who had\nworked with the Allman Brothers and Kansas.\n\nPatto collaborated with all the band members to write the songs on this album.\n\"Rich Man's Daughter\" is a reworking of the same song recorded by the Boxer\nlineup for [[Bloodletting (Boxer album)|Bloodletting]], which was recorded in\n1976. This album was the last recording nade by Patto.\n","linknr":131,"url":"Absolutely_(Boxer_album)_","recorded":1374520729,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Absolutley_album_Cover_UK.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/Absolutley_album_Cover_UK.jpg","/wiki/Studio_album","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Rock_music","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Sony_Music_Entertainment","/wiki/Epic_Records","/wiki/EMI","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Jeff_Glixman","/wiki/Below_the_Belt_(Boxer_album)","/wiki/Bloodletting_(Boxer_album)","/wiki/File:Below_the_belt_album_Cover_US.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Below_the_belt_album_Cover_US.jpg","/wiki/Rock_music","/wiki/Boxer_(band)","/wiki/Epic_Records","/wiki/Mike_Patto","/wiki/Tim_Bogert","/wiki/Vanilla_Fudge","/wiki/Sparks_(band)","/wiki/Joe_Cocker","/wiki/Wha-Koo","#cite_note-1","/wiki/George_Martin","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Jeff_Glixman","/wiki/The_Allman_Brothers_Band","/wiki/Kansas_(band)","/wiki/Bloodletting_(Boxer_album)","#cite_note-3","#Track_listing","#Band_Personnel","#Technical_Personnel","#Re-issues","#Notes","#Literature","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Mike_Patto","/wiki/Chris_Stainton","/wiki/Tim_Bogert","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Virgin_Records","/wiki/EMI","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit&section=5","#cite_ref-1","http://www.pattofan.com/Boxer/boxer-abs.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.pattofan.com/Boxer/tuduri.htm","#cite_ref-3","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9788809215221","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit&section=7","http://www.discogs.com/release/773313","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&oldid=552848724","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Virgin_Records_albums","/wiki/Category:EMI_Records_albums","/wiki/Category:Epic_Records_albums","/wiki/Category:1977_albums","/wiki/Category:Boxer_albums","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hAudio_microformats","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Absolutely+%28Boxer+album%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Absolutely+%28Boxer+album%29","/wiki/Absolutely_(Boxer_album)","/wiki/Talk:Absolutely_(Boxer_album)","#","/wiki/Absolutely_(Boxer_album)","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Absolutely_(Boxer_album)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Absolutely_(Boxer_album)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&oldid=552848724","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4669844","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Absolutely_%28Boxer_album%29&id=552848724","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Absolutely+%28Boxer+album%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Absolutely+%28Boxer+album%29&oldid=552848724&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Absolutely_(Boxer_album)&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4669844#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.
