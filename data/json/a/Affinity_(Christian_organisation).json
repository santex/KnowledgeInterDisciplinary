There are currently about 1300\nchurch congregations linked to Affinity. The\norganisation's subtitle is \"Church-centred Partnership for Bible-centred\nChristianity\".\n\nThe British Evangelical Council emerged, in reaction to the 1967 Keele\nUniversity conference, \"to draw in\nchurches predicated on Scriptural ecumenicity.\" It was opposed to the World\nCouncil of Churches.

Thus, many member churches are defined by a rigorous theology,\nadopting a separatist outlook. They regard churches with differing viewpoints as\nbeing in error and refuse to associate with them. For this reason they rarely\njoin the Evangelical Alliance, a similar but larger organisation with a broader\nmembership.\n\nGroups of churches linked to Affinity include the Apostolic Church, the\nAssociation of Grace Baptist Churches, the Evangelical Movement of Wales, the\nFellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches, the Free Church of Scotland, the\nFree Church of Scotland (Continuing), the Evangelical Fellowship of\nCongregational Churches, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and\nWales and Ireland and the Evangelical Connexion of the Free Church of England.
