Most common are \"organic amides\" (n = 1, E = C, x = 1), but many other\nimportant types of amides are known including phosphor amides (n = 2, E = P, x =\n1 and many related formulas) and sulfonamides (E = S, x=\n2). http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00266.html The term amide refers both\nto classes of compounds and to the [[functional group]]\n(R nE(O) xNR' 2) within those compounds.\n\nAmide can also refer to the conjugate base of ammonia (the anion\nH 2N â ) or of an organic amine (an anion\nR 2N â ).
