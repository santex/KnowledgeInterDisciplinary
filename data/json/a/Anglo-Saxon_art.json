{"cursor":"47047","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", early 7th century]]\n\n\n'Anglo-Saxon art' covers art produced within the Anglo-Saxon period of English\nhistory, beginning with the Migration period style that the Anglo-Saxons\nbrought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066\nwith the Norman Conquest of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose\nsophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe. The two periods\nof outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork\nand jewellery from Sutton Hoo and a series of magnificent illuminated\nmanuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of\nEnglish culture after the end of the Viking invasions. By the time of the\nConquest the move to the Romanesque style is nearly complete. The important\nartistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in\nthe extremities of England, in Northumbria, especially in the early period, and\nWessex and Kent near the south coast.\n\nAnglo-Saxon art survives mostly in illuminated manuscripts, Anglo-Saxon\narchitecture, a number of very fine ivory carvings, and some works in metal and\nother materials. Opus Anglicanum (\"English work\") was already recognised as the\nfinest embroidery in Europe, although only a few pieces from the Anglo-Saxon\nperiod remain - the Bayeux Tapestry is a rather different sort of embroidery, on\na far larger scale. As in most of Europe at the time, metalwork was the most\nhighly regarded form of art by the Anglo-Saxons, but hardly any survives - there\nwas enormous plundering of Anglo-Saxon churches, monasteries and the possessions\nof the dispossessed nobility by the new Norman rulers in their first decades, as\nwell as the Norsemen before them, and the English Reformation after them, and\nmost survivals were once on the continent. Dodwell (1982)'s Chapter 1 gives\na detailed analysis of the various causes of destruction of works of art,\nespecially metalwork Anglo-Saxon taste favoured brightness and colour, and\nan effort of the imagination is often needed to see the excavated and worn\nremains that survive as they once were. Wilson, 10-11; Dodwell (1982),\nchapter 2\n\nPerhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was\ncommissioned by a Norman patron from English artists working in the traditional\nAnglo-Saxon style. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in fresco, stone, ivory and\nwhalebone (notably the Franks Casket), metalwork (for example the Fuller\nbrooch), glass and enamel, many examples of which have been recovered through\narchaeological excavation and some of which have simply been preserved over the\ncenturies, especially in churches on the Continent, as the Vikings, Normans and\nReformation iconoclasm between them left virtually nothing in England except for\nbooks and archaeological finds.\n","linknr":621,"url":"Anglo-Saxon_art","recorded":1362479202,"links":60,"instances":["region","ornament","building","sculpture","art","english_coin"],"pdf":["http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/medieval/saga/pdf/015-bailey.pdf","http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/medieval/saga/pdf/015-bailey.pdf"],"categories":["Anglo-Saxon
