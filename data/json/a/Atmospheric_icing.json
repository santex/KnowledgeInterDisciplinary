This can be extremely dangerous to aircraft, as the built-\nup ice changes the aerodynamics of the flight surfaces, which can increase the\nrisk of a subsequent stalling of the airfoil. For this reason, ice protection\nsystems are often considered critical components of flight, and aircraft are\noften deiced prior to take-off in icy environments.\n\nNot all water freezes at . Liquid water below this temperature is called\nsupercooled, and such supercooled droplets cause the icing problems on aircraft.\nBelow , icing is rare because clouds at these temperatures usually consist of\nice particles rather than supercooled water droplets. Below , supercooled water\ncannot exist, therefore icing is impossible.\n\nIcing also occurs on towers, wind turbines, boats, oil rigs, trees and other\nobjects exposed to low temperatures and water droplets.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Atmospheric_icing","recorded":1362372234,"links":20,"instances":["flight","liquid","nautical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Precipitation"],"headings":["Aircraft incidents","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Windbuchencom.jpg/300px-Windbuchencom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drop","liquid"],["stall","flight"],["icing","nautical"]],"members":["stall","drop","icing"],"related":["Water","Drop_(liquid)","Atmosphere","Freeze","Aircraft","Ice","Aerodynamics","Stall_(flight)","Airfoil","Ice_protection_system","Deicing","Supercooling","Tower","Wind_turbine","Boat","Drilling_rig","Condensation","Deicing","Frost","Hard_rime","Ice_protection_system","Icing_(nautical)","Soft_rime","FAA","United_States","FAA","United_States","FAA","United_States","WSJ"]}
