Each Atlas V rocket\nuses a Russian-built RD-180 engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to power\nits first stage and an American-built RL10 engine burning liquid hydrogen and\nliquid oxygen to power its Centaur upper stage. The RD-180 engines are provided\nby RD AMROSS and the RL10 engines by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne. Some\nconfigurations also use strap-on booster rockets made by Aerojet. The standard\npayload fairing sizes are 4 or 5 meters in diameter and of various lengths, are\nmade by RUAG Space. Fairings sizes as large as 7.2m in diameter and up to 32.3m\nin length have been considered. The rocket is assembled in Decatur,\nAlabama; Harlingen, Texas; San Diego, California; and at United Launch\nAlliance's headquarters near Denver, Colorado.

Retrieved on 2011-11-19.\n\nIn its  three dozen launches, starting with its maiden launch in\nAugust 2002, Atlas V has had a near-perfect success rate. One flight on June 15,\n2007, NRO L-30, experienced an upper-stage anomaly when the engine in the\nvehicle's Centaur upper stage shut down early, leaving the payloadâa pair of\nocean surveillance satellitesâin a lower than intended orbit. However, the customer, the National Reconnaissance Office, categorized\nthe mission as a success.\n","linknr":1548,"url":"Atlas_V","recorded":1362267916,"links":92,"instances":["rocket","rocket","spacecraft","rocket_family","unit","rocket_stage","rocketry"],"pdf":["http://www.unitedlaunchalliance.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/AtlasVUsersGuide2010.pdf","http://www.unitedlaunchalliance.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/AtlasVUsersGuide2010.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/AtlasVUsersGuide2010.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/AtlasVUsersGuide2010.pdf","http://unitedlaunchalliance.com/site/docs/publications/CentaurApplicationtoRoboticandCrewedLunarLanderEvolution.pdf","http://unitedlaunchalliance.com/site/docs/publications/CentaurApplicationtoRoboticandCrewedLunarLanderEvolution.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/AtlasVUsersGuide2010.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/docs/product_sheet/GXProductCard.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/docs/product_sheet/GXProductCard.pdf","http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2006/RAND_MG503.pdf","http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2006/RAND_MG503.pdf","http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2006/RAND_MG503.pdf","http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2006/RAND_MG503.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/AtlasVUsersGuide2010.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/AtlasVUsersGuide2010.pdf","http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/ssc/cls/AVUG_Rev11_March2010.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/ast_developments_concepts_2010.pdf","http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/ast_developments_concepts_2010.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/products/Cutaways/Atlas500_Cutaway.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/products/Cutaways/Atlas400_Cutaway.pdf","http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/13435.pdf"],"categories":["Expendable
