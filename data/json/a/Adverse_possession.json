{"cursor":"28236","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Adverse possession' is a process by which premises can change ownership. It is\ngoverned by statute Law of Property Act 1925 concerning the title to\nreal property (land and the fixed structures built upon it). By adverse\npossession, title to another's real property can be acquired without\ncompensation, by holding the property in a manner that conflicts with the true\nowner's rights for a specified period. For example, squatter's rights are a\nspecific form of adverse possession.\n\nThe circumstances in which adverse possession arises determine the type of title\nacquired by the disseisor (the one who obtains the title from the original\nowner), which may be fee simple title, mineral rights, or another interest in\nreal property. Adverse possession's origins are based both in statutory actions\nand in common law precepts, so the details concerning adverse possession actions\nvary by jurisdiction. The required period of uninterrupted possession is\ngoverned by the statute of limitations. Other elements of adverse possession are\njudicial constructs.\n\nChattel property may also be adversely possessed, but owing to the vast\ndifferences between real and chattel property, the rules respecting such\nattempt are rather more stringent, favoring the original owner rather than the\nadverse possessor/disseisor; such rules find particular application respecting\nworks of art.\n","linknr":327,"url":"Adverse_possession","recorded":1362570428,"links":20,"instances":["sovereignty_transfer","law","property"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Real property law","Legal terms"],"headings":["History","Purpose and moral basis","Requirements for adverse possession","Effect of adverse possession","England and Wales","Squatter's rights","Comparison to homesteading","Copyrights","Adverse possession of easements","Non-common law jurisdictions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Adverse_possession_legal_definition.jpg/220px-Adverse_possession_legal_definition.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["title","property"],["reversion","law"],["prescription","sovereignty_transfer"],["title","property"]],"members":["prescription","reversion","title"],"related":["Title_(property)","Real_property","Remuneration","Owner","Right","Disseisor","Fee_simple","Mineral_rights","Statutory","Jurisdiction","Statute_of_limitations","Chattel","Work_of_art","Lien","Surveying","Statute","Hunting","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit","Tenants_in_common","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Timber","Maine","Color_of_title","Trespass","Acquiescence","Jurisdiction","England_and_Wales","Equitable","Trustee","Color_of_title","Land_court","Quiet_title","Abutter","Property_tax","Eminent_domain","Railroad","Torrens_title","England_and_Wales","Fill","Dredging","U.S._Supreme_Court","Original_jurisdiction","Georgia_v._South_Carolina","Treaty_of_Beaufort","Georgia_v._South_Carolina","Limitation_Act_1980","Land_Registration_Act_1925","Land_Registration_Act_2002","Trust_law","Right_to_property","Reversion_(law)","England_and_Wales","Squatters","Homestead_principle","Homestead_principle","Real_property","Personal_property","Abandoned_property","Intellectual_property_law","Antitrust_law","Easement","Fee_title","Zoning","Property_rights","England_and_Wales","Limitation_Act_1980","Louisiana","Prescription_(sovereignty_transfer)","French_law","Roman_law","Romania","List_of_real_estate_topics","Homelessness","Easement","Rights_of_way_in_England_and_Wales","Escheat","Squatting","Usucaption","Usufruct","Property_law","Property_rights","Lien","Popular_sovereignty","Preemption_Act_of_1841","Revised_statute_2477","Deed","Title_(property)"]}
