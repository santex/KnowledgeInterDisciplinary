See\n    Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and Slater, who offer translations of\n    classical source material that utilises the term hypocrisis (acting) (1994,\n    257, 265–267).</ref> in this sense, an actor is one who interprets a\n    dramatic character.<ref name=\"confused\">This is true whether the character\n    than an actor plays is based on a real person or a fictional one, even\n    themselves (when the actor is 'playing themselves,' as in some forms of\n    experimental performance art, or, more commonly, as in John Malkovich's\n    performance in the film [[Being John Malkovich]]); to act is to create a\n    character in performance: \"The dramatic world can be extended to include the\n    'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain 'possible'\n    surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such\" (Elam 1980, 110).</ref>\n",
