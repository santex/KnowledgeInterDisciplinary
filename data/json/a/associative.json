In propositional logic, 'associativity' is a valid rule of\nreplacement for expressions in logical proofs.\n\nWithin an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same\nassociative operator, the order in which the operations are performed does not\nmatter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed. That is,\nrearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value.\nConsider, for instance, the following equations:\n\n:<math>(5+2)+1=5+(2+1)=8 \\,</math>\n\n:<math>5\\times(5\\times3)=(5\\times5)\\times3=75 \\,</math>\n\nConsider the first equation. Even though the parentheses were rearranged (the\nleft side requires adding 5 and 2 first, then adding 1 to the result, whereas\nthe right side requires adding 2 and 1 first, then 5), the value of the\nexpression was not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition on\nany real numbers, we say that \"addition of real numbers is an associative\noperation.\"\n\nAssociativity is not to be confused with commutativity. Commutativity justifies\nchanging the order or sequence of the operands within an expression while\nassociativity does not. For example,\n\n:<math>(5+2)+1=5+(2+1) \\,</math>\n\nis an example of associativity because the parentheses were changed (and\nconsequently the order of operations during evaluation) while the operands 5, 2,\nand 1 appeared in exactly the same order from left to right in the expression.\nIn contrast,\n\n:<math>(5+2)+1=(2+5)+1 \\,</math>\n\nis an example of commutativity, not associativity, because the operand sequence\nchanged when the 2 and 5 switched places.\n\nAssociative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many algebraic\nstructures (such as semigroups and categories) explicitly require their binary\noperations to be associative.\n\nHowever, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; some\nexamples include subtraction, exponentiation and the vector cross product.\n","title":"Associative%20property","headings":["Definition","Generalized associative law","Examples","Propositional logic","Non-associativity","See also","References"]},"micro-relation":["3: Formal_proof","3: Exponentiation","2: Binary_operation","2: Propositional_logic","2: Validity","2: Rule_of_replacement","2: Well-formed_formula","2: Real_number","2: Commutativity","2: Subtraction","2: Multiplication","2: Currying","1: Mathematics","1: Operand","1: Bracket#Parentheses_%28_%29","1: Algebraic_structure","1: Vector_cross_product","1: String_concatenation","1: Arithmetic","1: Addition","1: Complex_number","1: Quaternion","1: Octonion","1: Greatest_common_divisor","1: Least_common_multiple","1: Functional_composition","1: Linear_map","1: Matrix_multiplication","1: Metalogic","1: Logical_connective","1: Logical_equivalence","1: Lie_algebra","1: Jacobi_identity","1: Infinitesimal_transformation","1: Non-associative_algebra","1: Combinatorial_mathematics","1: Quasigroup","1: Quasifield","1: Nonassociative_ring","1: Order_of_operations","1: Mathematician","1: Curry-Howard_correspondence","1: Cross_product","1: Average","1: Material_nonimplication","1: Light's_associativity_test","1: Semigroup","1: Distributivity","1: Power_associativity","1: Alternativity","1: N-ary_associativity"]}
