The colours of the object also become\nless saturated and shift towards the background color, which is usually blue,\nbut under some conditions may be some other color (for example, at sunrise or\nsunset distant colors may shift towards red).\n","linknr":157,"url":"Aerial_perspective","recorded":1362893268,"links":27,"instances":["color_theory","disambiguation","leonardo","vision","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Perspective projection","Artistic techniques","Vision","Perception","Visual perception","Composition in visual art"],"headings":["History","Optics","Why reducing contrast reduces clarity","In art","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/SerraEstrela-MAR2007-5.jpg/250px-SerraEstrela-MAR2007-5.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Mount_Feathertop%2C_Australia_-_May_2005.jpg/250px-Mount_Feathertop%2C_Australia_-_May_2005.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Dai_Jin-Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Yan_Wengui.jpg/250px-Dai_Jin-Landscape_in_the_Style_of_Yan_Wengui.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Frans_Koppelaar_-_Landscape_near_Bologna.jpg/250px-Frans_Koppelaar_-_Landscape_near_Bologna.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["contrast","vision"],["saturation","color_theory"],["the_last_supper","leonardo"],["contrast","vision"],["focus","optics"],["aerial_perspective","disambiguation"]],"members":["saturation","aerial_perspective","the_last_supper","contrast","focus"],"related":["Contre-jour","Ming_Dynasty","Contrast_(vision)","Saturation_(color_theory)","Leon_Battista_Alberti","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Mona_Lisa","The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)","Pompeian_Styles","Daylight","Scattering","Diffuse_sky_radiation","Line-of-sight_propagation","Haze","Veiling_luminance","Short_wavelength","Rayleigh_scattering","Moon","Self-luminous","Visual_acuity","Contrast_sensitivity","Multiplicative_inverse","Contrast_(vision)","Grating","Contrast_sensitivity_function","Spatial_frequency","Visual_angle","Focus_(optics)","Aerial_viewpoint","Aerial_landscape","Frans_Koppelaar","Aerial_landscape_art","Aerial_perspective_(disambiguation)","Aerial_shot","Haze","Landscape_art","Rayleigh_scattering","Tyndall_effect"]}
