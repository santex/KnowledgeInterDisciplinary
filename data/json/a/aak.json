It is an imported form of Chinese ritual\nmusic. Aak is often labeled as \"elegant music\" in contrast with other\ntraditional Korean music. Aak began as the music played during the Korean\n\"Jongmyo Shrine's Jerye Ceremony,\" and was later used for other occasions, and\nas Korean court music, often with lyrics praising the current ruler.\n\nAak was brought to Korea in 1116 through a large gift of musical instruments\nfrom the Song Dynasty emperor Huizong. It remained very popular for a time\n(there were originally no fewer than 456 different melodies in use) before\ndying out. It was revived in 1430, based on a reconstruction of older melodies.\nThe music is now highly specialized, and uses just two different surviving\nmelodies. It is played only at certain very rare concerts, such as the Munmyo\njeryeak (Sacrifice to Confucius) held each spring and autumn at the Munmyo\nshrine in Seoul.\n\nAak is one of three types of Korean court music; the other two are [[dangak]]\nand [[hyangak]]. Aak is similar to dangak in that both are rarely played and\nboth have Chinese influences.\n\nThe article on Aak in the Encyclopaedia Britannica is the very first, though it\nconsists only of a cross-reference to the article on gagaku.\n","title":"aak","headings":["See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Korean_court_music","2: Korean_music","2: Munmyo","2: Gagaku","1: Musical_genre","1: China","1: Music","1: Korea","1: Song_Dynasty","1: Melody","1: Confucius","1: Seoul","1: Encyclopaedia_Britannica","1: Yayue","1: Dangak","1: Hyangak","1: Akhak_Gwebeom","1: National_Center_for_Korean_Traditional_Performing_Arts","1: Traditional_Korean_musical_instruments","1: Nhã_nhạc","1: Culture_of_Korea","1: List_of_Korea-related_topics"]}
