The organization's headquarters is in West\nConshohocken, Pennsylvania, about 5 miles (8 km) northwest of Philadelphia.\n\nASTM, founded in 1898 as the American Section of the International Association\nfor Testing and Materials, predates other standards organizations such as BSI\n(1901), DIN (1917), ANSI (1918) and AFNOR (1926). ASTM has a dominant role among\nstandards developers in the USA, and claims to be the world's largest developer\nof standards. Using a consensus process, ASTM supports thousands of volunteer\ntechnical committees, which draw their members from around the world and\ncollectively develop and maintain more than 12,000 standards.\n\nASTM International publishes the Annual Book of ASTM Standards each year in\nprint, Compact Disc (CD) and online versions. The online version was available\nby subscription and cost was based upon usage. For 2008, the complete set of\nbooks or CDs cost almost US$9000 and included 81 volumes. For 2010, the complete\nset of books or CDs cost almost $9700 and included 82 volumes.\n","linknr":217,"url":"ASTM","recorded":1362481794,"links":32,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Standards organizations","ASTM standards|","Organizations based in the United States","Organizations established in 1898","International nongovernmental organizations","International non-profit organizations","Technical specifications"],"headings":["History","Standards","Membership and organization","Standards compliance","Standards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/ASTM_logo.svg/150px-ASTM_logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["501(c(3"]],"members":[],"related":["Governmental_organization","Non-governmental_organization","Intergovernmental_organization","International_nongovernmental_organization","West_Conshohocken,_Pennsylvania","United_States","Standards_organization","International_standard","West_Conshohocken,_Pennsylvania","Philadelphia","British_Standards","Deutsches_Institut_f√ºr_Normung","ANSI","AFNOR","Consensus_decision-making","Compact_Disc","United_States_dollar","Scientist","Engineer","Charles_Benjamin_Dudley","Rail_tracks","Fracture","Rail_transport","Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Medical_Instrumentation","ANSI","DIN","Geothermal_Energy","Volunteer","Antitrust","China","ASTM_International_Award_of_Merit","Internal_Revenue_Service","501(c)(3)","United_States","National_Technology_Transfer_and_Advancement_Act","Materials_property","Pt/Co_scale","Technical_standard"]}
