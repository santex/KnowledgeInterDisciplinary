The'precision'''<ref\nname=metrology_terms /> of a measurement system, also called reproducibility or\nrepeatability, is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged\nconditions show the same results.<ref name=Taylor></ref> Although the two words\nprecision and accuracy can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are\ndeliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.\n\nA measurement system can be accurate but not precise, precise but not accurate,\nneither, or both. For example, if an experiment contains a systematic error,\nthen increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not\nimprove accuracy. The result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of\nresults from the flawed experiment. Eliminating the systematic error improves\naccuracy but does not change precision.\n\nA measurement system is considered valid if it is both accurate and precise.\nRelated terms include bias (non-random or directed effects caused by a factor or\nfactors unrelated to the independent variable) and error (random variability).\n\nThe terminology is also applied to indirect measurements—that is, values\nobtained by a computational procedure from observed data.\n\nIn addition to accuracy and precision, measurements may also have a measurement\nresolution, which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity\nthat produces a response in the measurement.\n\nIn numerical analysis, accuracy is also the nearness of a calculation to the\ntrue value; while precision is the resolution of the representation, typically\ndefined by the number of decimal or binary digits.\n","title":"Accuracy%20and%20precision","headings":["Quantification","Terminology of ISO 5725","In binary classification","In psychometrics and psychophysics","In logic simulation","In information systems","See also","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["2: Positive_predictive_value","2: Sensitivity_and_specificity","1: Science","1: Engineering","1: Industry","1: Statistics","1: Reproducibility","1: Repeatability","1: Result","1: Precision","1: Accuracy","1: Synonymous","1: Colloquial","1: Scientific_method","1: Experiment","1: Systematic_error","1: Sample_size","1: Random","1: Independent_variable","1: Sensor#Resolution","1: Numerical_analysis","1: Traceability","1: Technical_standard","1: SI","1: Standards_organization","1: National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology","1: United_States","1: Central_limit_theorem","1: Probability_distribution","1: Mean","1: Bias_of_an_estimator","1: Calibration","1: Significant_figures","1: False_precision","1: Binary_classification","1: Negative_predictive_value","1: True_positive","1: True_negative","1: False_positive","1: Prevalence","1: Accuracy_paradox","1: Predictive_analytics","1: Predictive_power","1: Precision_and_recall","1: F-measure","1: Cohen's_kappa","1: Psychometrics","1: Psychophysics","1: Cronbach's_alpha","1: Logic_simulation","1: Electronic_circuit_simulation","1: Transistor","1: Transistor_models","1: Data_quality","1: Information_quality","1: Kristo_Ivanov","1: Accepted_and_experimental_value","1: Engineering_tolerance","1: Exactness","1: Experimental_uncertainty_analysis","1: F-score","1: Statistical_significance"]}
