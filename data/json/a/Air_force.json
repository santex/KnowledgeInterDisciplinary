{"cursor":"16442","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n:For military aviation conducted by armies and navies, see [[army aviation]] and\n[[naval aviation]].\n\n and a tanker aircraft of the USAF.]] B-2 Spirit stealth strategic bomber.]] of\n the Royal Air Force (1991).]] An 'air force', also known in some countries as\n an 'air army', is in the broadest sense, the national military organization\n that primarily conducts aerial warfare. More specifically, it is the branch of\n a nation's armed services that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct\n from an army, navy or other branch. Typically, air forces are responsible for\n gaining control of the air, carrying out strategic and tactical bombing\n missions and providing support to surface forces.\n\nThe term \"air force\" may also refer to a tactical air force or numbered air\nforce, which is an operational formation either within a national air force or\ncomprising several air components from allied nations. Air forces typically\nconsist of a combination of fighters, bombers, helicopters, transport planes and\nother aircraft.\n\nMany air forces are also responsible for operations of military space,\nintercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and communications equipment. Some\nair forces may command and control other air defence assets such as antiaircraft\nartillery, surface-to-air missiles, or anti-ballistic missile warning networks\nand defensive systems. Some nations, principally Russia, the former Soviet Union\nand countries who modelled their militaries along Soviet lines, have an Air\nDefence Force which is organizationally separate from their air force.\n\nIn addition to pilots, air forces have ground support staff who support the\naircrew. In a similar manner to civilian airlines, there are supporting ground\ncrew as pilots cannot fly without the assistance of other personnel such as\nengineers, loadmasters, fuel technicians and mechanics. However, some supporting\npersonnel such as airfield defence troops, weapons engineers and air\nintelligence staff do not have equivalent roles in civilian organizations.\n","linknr":495,"url":"Air_force","recorded":1362539429,"links":81,"instances":["canada","rank","air_force_unit","united_kingdom","military_unit","military_unit","air_force_unit","land_and_air","australia","aviation","world_war_ii","military_formation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Air
