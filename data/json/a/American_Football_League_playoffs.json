{"cursor":"19414","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nFrom 1960 to 1968, the American Football League determined its champion via a\nsingle playoff game between the winners of its two divisions (although ties in\nthe standings during the 1963 and 1968 seasons necessitated a divisional\nplayoff game).\n\nIn 1969, the final year of the independent AFL, a four-team playoff was held,\nwith the second-place teams in each division playing the winner of the other\ndivision in what were called the \"Interdivisional\" playoffs. These playoffs were\nnot, and are not considered to have been, \"wildcard\" playoffs since the two best\nnon-division winners did not automatically qualify. (Had the 1969 playoffs been\ntrue wildcard playoffs, the Western Division's third-place team, San Diego,\nwould have qualified while the Eastern Division's second-place team, Houston,\nwould not have.) The 1969 playoffs were only the second time a major\nprofessional football league allowed teams other than the first place teams to\ncompete in post-season playoffs (the other instance being the All-America\nFootball Conference's 1949 four-team playoff).\n\nPrior to the advent of the Super Bowl for the 1966 season, the AFL went to great\nlengths to avoid scheduling its playoffs head-to-head with the NFL. In 1960, the\nNFL's game was held on Monday, December 26; the AFL had that week off, and\nplayed its title contest on Sunday, January 1. In 1961 and 1962, the AFL played\nits game during the off-week between the end of the NFL's regular season and its\ntitle game (thus resulting in the AFL holding championship games on December 24,\n1961 and December 23, 1962, a week before the NFL's games of December 31, 1961\nand December 30, 1962). In 1963, the AFL held its Eastern Division tiebreaker\nplayoff on Saturday, December 28, 1963, thereby avoiding the Sunday, December\n29, 1963 NFL playoff (the AFL then held its 1963 Championship Game a week\nlater). In 1964, pro football had a championship weekend, with the AFL's title\ngame held on Saturday, December 26, 1964 and the NFL's championship contest\nbeing held on Sunday, December 27, 1964. For 1965, the AFL tried to return to\nthe practice of playing its game on a Sunday during the off-week between the NFL\nplayoff, slating its championship contest for December 26, 1965 while the NFL's\ngame wasn't held until January 2, 1966; unfortunately, the Colts and Packers\nrequired a Western Conference tiebreaker on the December 26, 1965 date --- and\nsince that game went overtime, the TV audience for the Bills-Chargers game in\nSan Diego was diminished considerably. Even in 1966, the AFL originally\nscheduled its championship game for the off-week, planning to hold its playoff\non Monday, December 26, 1966, six days before the NFL's scheduled playoff of\nJanuary 1, 1967.\n\nNegotiations prior to the first Super Bowl, during early December 1966, resulted\nin the two leagues agreeing to have championship doubleheaders for the next four\nyears, with each league holding its title game on the same day but at a\ndifferent time that day. Thus the final four AFL playoffs were held on the same\nday as the NFL championship game was (January 1, 1967; December 31, 1967;\nDecember 29, 1968; and January 4, 1970).\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame and the National Football League include AFL\nplayoffs in their statistics for the NFL playoffs.\n","linknr":400,"url":"American_Football_League_playoffs","recorded":1375078226,"links":["/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/ArenaBowl","/wiki/AFL_Grand_Final","/wiki/American_Football_League","/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)","/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame","/wiki/National_Football_League","/wiki/NFL_playoffs","#1960_Championship","#1961_Championship","#1962_Championship","#1963_playoffs","#Eastern_Division_playoff","#1963_Championship","#1964_Championship","#1965_Championship","#1966_Championship","#1967_Championship","#1968_playoffs","#Western_Division_playoff","#1968_Championship","#1969_playoffs","#Bracket","#Interdivisional_playoffs","#1969_Championship","#AFL_Championship_Game_appearances_1960-69","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/wiki/AFL_Championship_Game,_1960","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Tennessee_Titans","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/Jeppesen_Stadium","/wiki/Houston,_Texas","/wiki/Ben_Agajanian","/wiki/George_Blanda","/wiki/Bill_Groman","/wiki/Paul_Lowe","/wiki/Billy_Cannon","/wiki/AFL_Championship_Game,_1961","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Tennessee_Titans","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/Balboa_Stadium","/wiki/San_Diego,_California","/wiki/George_Blair_(American_football)","/wiki/AFL_Championship_Game,_1962","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/Tennessee_Titans","/wiki/Tommy_Brooker","/wiki/Abner_Haynes","/wiki/Len_Dawson","/wiki/Willard_Dewveall","/wiki/1963_AFL_season","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/War_Memorial_Stadium_(Buffalo)","/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York","/wiki/Gino_Cappelletti","/wiki/Larry_Garron","/wiki/Babe_Parilli","/wiki/Elbert_Dubenion","/wiki/Daryle_Lamonica","/wiki/John_Tracey","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/New_England_Patriots","/wiki/Balboa_Stadium","/wiki/San_Diego,_California","/wiki/Tobin_Rote","/wiki/Keith_Lincoln","/wiki/Don_Norton","/wiki/Lance_Alworth","/wiki/John_Hadl","/wiki/1964_AFL_season","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/War_Memorial_Stadium_(Buffalo)","/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York","/wiki/Dave_Kocourek","/wiki/Pete_Gogolak","/wiki/Wray_Carlton","/wiki/Jack_Kemp","/wiki/1965_AFL_season","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/San_Diego_Chargers","/wiki/Balboa_Stadium","/wiki/San_Diego,_California","/wiki/Ernie_Warlick","/wiki/Butch_Byrd","/wiki/Super_Bowl","/wiki/1966_AFL_season","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/War_Memorial_Stadium_(Buffalo)","/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York","/wiki/Hank_Stram","/wiki/Len_Dawson","/wiki/Fred_Arbanas","/wiki/Jack_Kemp","/wiki/Elbert_Dubenion","/w/index.php?title=Bobby_Crockett&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Johnny_Robinson_(safety)","/wiki/Mike_Mercer_(American_football)","/wiki/Chris_Burford","/wiki/Mike_Garrett","/wiki/Super_Bowl","/wiki/NFL","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/Super_Bowl_I","/wiki/1967_AFL_season","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=10","/wiki/Oakland_Raiders","/wiki/Tennessee_Titans","/wiki/Oakland-Alameda_County_Coliseum","/wiki/Oakland,_California","/wiki/Daryle_Lamonica","/wiki/Buffalo_Bills","/wiki/New_York_Jets","/wiki/Hoyle_Granger","/wiki/Pete_Beathard","/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs","/wiki/Hewritt_Dixon","/wiki/Dave_Kocourek","/wiki/George_Blanda","/wiki/Super_Bowl_II","/wiki/NFL","/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers","/wiki/1968_AFL_season","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=American_Football_League_playoffs&action=edit&sect
