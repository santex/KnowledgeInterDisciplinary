Worldwide it\nis estimated that the number of vertebrate animalsâfrom zebrafish to non-human\nprimatesâranges from the tens of millions to more than 100 million used\nannually.

It includes\npure research such as genetics, developmental biology, behavioral studies, as\nwell as applied research such as biomedical research, xenotransplantation, drug\ntesting and toxicology tests, including cosmetics testing. Animals are also used\nfor education, breeding, and defense research. The practice is regulated to\nvarious degrees in different countries.\n\nSupporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal\nSociety, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century\nrelied on the use of animals in some way, [http://royalsociety.org/The-use-of-non-human-animals-in-\nresearch-a-guide-for-scientists/ The use of non-human animals in research: a\nguide for scientists] The Royal Society, 2004, p. 1 with the Institute for\nLaboratory Animal Research of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arguing that\neven sophisticated computers are unable to model interactions between molecules,\ncells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment, making animal research\nnecessary in many areas.
