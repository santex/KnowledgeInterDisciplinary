Provides telephone feature transparency; features\n  available in a single system are available across the entire network.\n* ABC-A: Applications. Offers network-wide applications as both centralized and\n  distributed solutions.\n* ABC-R: Routing. An adaptive routing mechanism that optimizes the size of\n  network links and improves security. Designed to use: least-cost routing,\n  automatic route selection, forced on-net, break-in, break-out, and link\n  optimization on transfer.\n* ABC-M: Management. Guarantees consistency of databases among all Alcatel\n  OmniPCXs.
