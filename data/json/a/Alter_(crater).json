It lies to the southwest of the larger crater Robertson, and to the\neast of Ohm.\n\nThe outer rim of Alter has been degraded by subsequent erosion, most notably at\nthe northern and southern extremes. There is a small crater lying across the south-\nsoutheast rim. A cleft runs across the floor from the southern rim toward the\nnorth-northeast. Ray material cross the crater floor from the east, forming a\npair of faint bands.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Alter_(crater)","recorded":1362668717,"links":20,"instances":["moon","crater","crater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Impact craters on the Moon"],"headings":["Satellite craters","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Copernicus_crater_AS12-52-7739.jpg/30px-Copernicus_crater_AS12-52-7739.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["far_side","moon"],["robertson","crater"],["ohm","crater"]],"members":["far_side","robertson","ohm"],"related":["Dinsmore_Alter","Moon","Impact_crater","Sphere","Far_side_(Moon)","Moon","Robertson_(crater)","Ohm_(crater)","Ray_system"]}
