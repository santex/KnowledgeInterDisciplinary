Its\nfunction is to control the expulsion of feces, unwanted semi-solid matter\nproduced during digestion, which, depending on the type of animal, may include:\nmatter which the animal cannot digest, such as bones; {{cite journal |date=1998-06-18 |title=A\nking-sized theropod coprolite |journal=Nature |volume=393 |pages=680\n|author=Chin, K., Erickson, G.M. et al.\n|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v393/n6686/abs/393680a0.html\n|doi=10.1038/31461 |issue=6686}} Summary at {{cite journal |author=Monastersky,\nR. |title=Getting the scoop from the poop of T. rex |journal=Science News\n|volume=153 |issue=25 |date=1998-06-20 |pages=391\n|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/6_20_98/fob2.htm\n|doi=10.2307/4010364 |publisher=Society for Science & |jstor=4010364 }}\nfood material after all the nutrients have been extracted, for example cellulose\nor lignin; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive\ntract; and dead or excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts.\n\nAmphibians, reptiles, and birds use the same orifice (known as the cloaca) for\nexcreting liquid and solid wastes, and for copulation and egg-laying. Monotreme\nmammals also have a cloaca, which is thought to be a feature inherited from the\nearliest amniotes via the therapsids. Marsupials have a single orifice for\nexcreting both solids and liquids and, in females, a separate vagina for\nreproduction. Female placental mammals have completely separate orifices for\ndefecation, urination, and reproduction; males have one opening for defecation\nand another for both urination and reproduction, although the channels flowing\nto that orifice are almost completely separate.\n\nThe development of the anus was an important stage in the evolution of\nmulticellular animals. It appears to have happened at least twice, following\ndifferent paths in protostomes and deuterostomes. This accompanied or\nfacilitated other important evolutionary developments: the bilaterian body plan,\nthe coelom, and metamerism, in which the body was built of repeated \"modules\"\nwhich could later specialize, such as the heads of most arthropods, which are\ncomposed of fused, specialized segments.\n","linknr":266,"url":"Anus","recorded":1362556681,"links":95,"instances":["biology","zoology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Digestive system"],"headings":["Development","Notes","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Protovsdeuterostomes.svg/250px-Protovsdeuterostomes.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["egg","biology"],["metamerism","biology"],["gut","zoology"]],"members":["metamerism","gut","egg"],"related":["Proto-Indo-European_language","Digestive_tract","Feces","Coprolite","Cellulose","Lignin","Gut_bacteria","Endosymbiont","Cloaca","Copulation","Egg_(biology)","Monotreme","Amniote","Therapsid","Marsupial","Vagina","Placental","Defecation","Urination","Protostome","Deuterostome","Bilaterian","Coelom","Metamerism_(biology)","Arthropods","Earthworm","Embryo","Blastopore","Archenteron","Gut_(zoology)","Anal_canal"]}
