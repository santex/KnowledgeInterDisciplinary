{"cursor":"19746","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":723,"url":"A_priori_and_a_posteriori","article":"\n\n\nThe terms 'a priori' (\"from the earlier\") and 'a posteriori' (\"from the later\")\nare used in philosophy (epistemology) to distinguish two types of knowledge,\narguments:\n* A priori knowledge or justification is independent of experience (for example\n  \"All bachelors are unmarried\"). Galen Strawson wrote that an a priori argument\n  is one in which \"you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You\n  don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things\n  are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science.\"; Sommers\n  (2003), p. 15.\n* A posteriori knowledge or justification is dependent on experience or\n  empirical evidence (for example \"Some bachelors are very happy\"). A posteriori\n  justification makes reference to experience; but the issue concerns how one\n  knows the proposition or claim in question, or better say, what evidences one\n  has to verify the validity of proposition.\n\nThere are many points of view on these two types of assertions, and their\nrelationship is one of the oldest problems in modern philosophy.\n\nThey are primarily used as adjectives to modify the noun \"knowledge\", or taken\nto be compound nouns that refer to types of knowledge (for example, \"a priori\nknowledge\"). However, \"a priori\" is sometimes used as an adjective to modify\nother nouns, such as \"truth\". Additionally, philosophers often modify this\nuse. For example, \"apriority\" and \"aprioricity\" are sometimes used as nouns\nto refer (approximately) to the quality of being \"a priori\".\n\nAlthough definitions and use of the terms have varied in the history of\nphilosophy, they have consistently labelled two separate epistemological\nnotions. The intuitive distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge\nis best seen in examples.\n","recorded":1362124260,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"724","instances":["symbol","philosophy","symbol","philosophy","philosophy_of_science","logic","symbol","logic","logic","formal","psychology","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy","mathematics","knowledge","logic","mathematical_logic","philosophy","set_theory","philosophy_of_time","philosophy","symbol","philosophy_of_science","mathematics","philosophy","mathematics","linguistics","mathematical_logic","album","mathematical_logic","logic","mathematics","symbol","mathematics","mathematics","philosophy_of_time","disambiguation","logic","philosophy","mathematical_logic","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Justification","Kantianism","Philosophical
