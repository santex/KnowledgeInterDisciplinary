Approximately 22,000 Shell\nemployees are based in the U.S. The U.S. head office is in Houston, Texas. Shell\nOil Company, including its consolidated companies and its share in equity\ncompanies, is one of Americaâs largest oil and natural gas producers, natural\ngas marketers, gasoline marketers and petrochemical manufacturers.\n\nShell is the market leader through approximately 25,000 Shell-branded gas\nstations in the US which also serve as Shell's most visible public presence.\nShell Oil Company is a 50/50 partner with the Saudi Arabian government-owned oil\ncompany Saudi Aramco in Motiva Enterprises, a refining and marketing joint\nventure which owns and operates three oil refineries on the Gulf Coast of the\nUnited States.\n\n near Lost Hills, California]]\n\nShell products include oils, fuels, and card services as well as exploration,\nproduction, and refining of petroleum products. The\nShell Oil Refinery in Martinez, California, the first Shell refinery in the\nUnited States, supplies Shell and Texaco stations in the\nWest and Midwest.\n\nShell gasolines previously included the RU2000 and SU2000 lines (later there was\na SU2000E) but they have been superseded by the V-Power line.\n\nIn 1997, Shell and Texaco entered into two refining/marketing joint ventures.\nOne combined their midwestern and western operations and was known as Equilon.\nThe other, known as Motiva, combined the eastern and gulf coast operations of\nShell Oil and Star Enterprise, itself a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and\nTexaco. After Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001, Shell purchased\nTexaco's shares in the joint ventures. In 2002, Shell\nbegan converting these Texaco stations to the Shell brand, a process that was to\nbe completed by June 2004 and was called \"the largest retail re-branding\ninitiative in American business history.\"\n","linknr":428,"url":"Shell_Oil_Company","recorded":1362673026,"links":39,"instances":["legal","united_states"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lawsociety.ie/Gazette/oct05.pdf","http://www.lawsociety.ie/Gazette/oct05.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lawsociety.ie/Gazette/oct05.pdf","http://www.classaction.ca/CMSFiles/PDF/Product/PolyPipe/Shell_PBP_PR_Release.pdf","http://www.classaction.ca/CMSFiles/PDF/Product/PolyPipe/Shell_PBP_PR_Release.pdf"],"categories":["Royal Dutch Shell subsidiaries","Automotive fuel brands|Shell","Oil companies of the United States","Companies based in Houston, Texas","Gas stations of the United States","American brands"],"headings":["Relationship with Royal Dutch Shell","Subsidiaries","Legal issues","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e8/Shell_logo.svg/150px-Shell_logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/OneShellPlaza.jpg/220px-OneShellPlaza.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Shellgasstationlosthills.jpg/220px-Shellgasstationlosthills.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/Shell_logo_%28USA%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/Logo-shell.jpg/220px-Logo-shell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Anacortes_Refinery_32017.JPG/220px-Anacortes_Refinery_32017.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Houston%2C_Texas.png/32px-Flag_of_Houston%2C_Texas.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Factory_1b.svg/32px-Factory_1b.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Increase2.svg/11px-Increase2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clean_air_act","united_states"],["execution","legal"]],"members":["execution","clean_air_act"],"related":["Houston,_Texas","Oil_company","Royal_Dutch_Shell","Royal_Dutch_Shell","Multinational_corporation","Oil_major","Oil_company","Houston,_Texas","Saudi_Aramco","Motiva_Enterprises","Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States","Lost_Hills,_California","Texaco","V-Power","Motiva","Chevron_Corporation","NYSE","The_Hague","Legal_liability","Aera_Energy_LLC","Mobil","Shell_Development_Emeryville","Motiva_Enterprises","Saudi_Refining","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)","Volatile_organic_compound","Connecticut_Department_of_Environmental_Protection","Anacortes,_Washington","Pacific_Northwest","Deer_Park,_Texas","Harris_County,_Texas","Philips","Mehdi_Shahbazi","Geographical_pricing","Broadhaven","Sruth_Fada_Conn","Kilcommon","County_Mayo","Mayo_County_Council","Rossport_Five","RTÉ","Polybutylene","U.S._District_Court","Sani_Abacha","Ken_Saro-Wiwa","Ogoni_people","Nonviolence","Niger_Delta","Movement_for_the_Survival_of_the_Ogoni_People","Military_tribunal","Execution_(legal)","Center_for_Constitutional_Rights","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Petroleum_geology","Fred_Meissner","M._King_Hubbert","Hubbert_peak_theory","Oil_depletion","Motiva_Enterprises"]}
