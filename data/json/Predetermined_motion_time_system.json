{"cursor":"5758","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'predetermined motion time system (PMTS)' is frequently used to set labor\nrates in industry by quantifying the amount of time required to perform specific\ntasks. The first such system is known as Methods-time measurement, released in\n1948 and today existing in several variations, commonly known as MTM-1, MTM-2,\nMTM-UAS, MTM-MEK and MTM-B. Obsolete MTM standards include MTM-3 and MMMM (4M).\nThe MTM-2 standard has also largely been phased out by the organization, but is\nstill used in some commercial applications.\n\nAnother popular PMTS is the Maynard Operation Sequence Technique, which was\nfirst released in 1972. That method also has several variations, with the most\ncommonly used being BasicMOST, and others being MiniMOST, MaxiMOST, and\nAdminMOST. The variations of both systems differ from each other based on their\nlevel of focus. MTM-1 and MiniMOST are optimal for short processes with only\nsmall hand motions. BasicMOST, MODAPTS and MTM-UAS are more suitable for\nprocesses that average around 1 to 5 minutes, while MTM-B and MaxiMOST are more\nproperly used for longer processes that are less repetitive.\n\nYet another popular PMTS used today in the automotive, sewing and healthcare\nindustries is the 'MODAPTS' technique. This technique was introduced in 1966 by\nG. C. \"Chris\" Heyde who originally learned the MTM-1 and MTM-2 methods in the\n1950s and sought a simpler technique to use and apply. Unlike the MTM and MOST\nstandards, MODAPTS uses a MOD as its basic unit of measurement (1 MOD = 0.129\nseconds). However, like Basic-MOST, MODAPTS uses a coding technique that\nconsists of a letter and an integer number (all but 1 code), where the integer\nnumbers each represent MODS that can be easily added to determine a coded\ntask's time.\n\nGeneral Sewing Data is a PMTS for the sewn products and apparel industires and\nis based on MTM Core Data both proprietary data systems of GSD (Corporate) Ltd\nof Preston, UK. The Time standards for General Sewing Data are used in GSD\nEnterprise and GSD QUEST.\n\nSeweasy is a more recent system used in Ready Made Garment (RMG) manufacturing,\nwhich is based on lean concept developed by Toyota. This system focuses on\nproviding quick Standard Minute Values (SAM, SMV) for labour costing, âsewing\nload balancing\" in line with Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and \"added value\"\nmeasurement. SewEasy Pvt. Ltd has trained many juniors and seniors alike, to\nquickly establish standard garment sewing data by using this easy PMTS system.\nRecent research in Asia on Labor Costs and Wages Calculations brought SewEasy\nand MTM to the notice of apparel industry's sourcing professionals.\n\nUnlike time studies, in which an analyst uses a stopwatch and subjectively rates\nthe operator's effort to calculate a standard time, a PMTS requires that the\nanalyst break apart the process into its component actions, assign time values\nto each action, and sum the times to calculate the total standard time.\n\nMost predetermined motion time systems (MTM and MOST) use time measurement units\n(TMU) instead of seconds for measuring time. One TMU is defined to be\n0.00001 hours, or 0.036 seconds. These smaller units allow for more\naccurate calculations without the use of decimals. In the most in-depth PMT\nsystems, motions observed will be on the level of individual TMUs, like toss (3\nTMUs in MiniMOST) and simple pick-up (2 TMUs in MTM-1). More general systems\nsimplify things by grouping individual elements, and thus have larger time\nvalues – for example, a bend and arise (61 TMUs in MTM-2) and one or two\nsteps (30 TMUs in BasicMOST). Systems with even less detail work with TMU values\nin the hundreds, like climbing 10 rungs on a ladder (300 TMUs in MaxiMOST) or\npassing through a door (100 TMUs in MaxiMOST).\n\nThe choice of which variation of a certain PMTS to use is dependent on the need\nfor accuracy in contrast to the need for quick analysis, as well as the length\nof the operation, the distances involved in the operation, and the\nrepetitiveness of the operation. Longer operations often take place on a larger\nspatial scale, and tend to be less repetitive, so these issues are often treated\nas one. For longer, less repetitive operations, statistical analysis\ndemonstrates that the accuracy of less detailed systems will generally approach\nthe accuracy of more detailed systems. Thus, in order to reduce the time\nrequired for analysis, less detailed systems (like MTM-B and MaxiMOST) are\nusually used when possible. Conversely, very short, repetitive processes are\ncommonly analyzed with more exact methods like MTM-1 and MiniMOST because of the\nneed for accuracy.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Predetermined_motion_time_system","recorded":1374780911,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Methods-time_measurement","/wiki/Maynard_Operation_Sequence_Technique","/w/index.php?title=G._C._Heyde&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Seweasy","/wiki/SewEasy_Pvt._Ltd","/wiki/Hour","/wiki/Second","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Toyota_Production_System","/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints","/wiki/Time_and_motion_study","/wiki/Value_Stream_Mapping","/wiki/Production_levelling","/wiki/Takt_time","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0824709535","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=edit&section=3","http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/SE/salamah/Methods_Engineering/MTM-1_system.pdf","http://www.mtm.org/","http://www.modapts.org/","http://www.gsdhq.com/","http://www.seweasy.biz/","http://www.3ds.com/","http://www.proplanner.com/","http://www.time-study.com/Time_Study_LLC/Home_-_Time_Study.html","http://www.appbrain.com/app/time-motion-study/com.nextw3.timemotionstudy","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&oldid=559990265","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Production_and_manufacturing","/wiki/Category:Industrial_engineering","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Predetermined+motion+time+system&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Predetermined+motion+time+system","/wiki/Predetermined_motion_time_system","/wiki/Talk:Predetermined_motion_time_system","#","/wiki/Predetermined_motion_time_system","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Predetermined_motion_time_system","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Predetermined_motion_time_system","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&oldid=559990265","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1736180","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Predetermined_motion_time_system&id=559990265","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Predetermined+motion+time+system","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Predetermined+motion+time+system&oldid=559990265&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Predetermined_motion_time_system&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systeme_vorbestimmter_Zeiten","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predetermined_motion_time_system","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1736180#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predetermined_motion_time_system","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=fa
