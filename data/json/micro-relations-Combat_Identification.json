{"cursor":"8164","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\ns on aircraft]]\n\n\nIn telecommunications, 'identification, friend or foe (IFF)' is an\nidentification system designed for command and control. It enables military and\nnational (civilian-located ATC) interrogation systems to identify aircraft,\nvehicles or forces as friendly and to determine their bearing and range from the\ninterrogator. IFF may be used by both military and civilian aircraft.\n\nIFF was first developed during World War II. The term is something of a\nmisnomer, as IFF can positively identify friendly targets but not hostile ones.\nIf an IFF interrogation receives no reply or an invalid reply, the object cannot\nbe identified as friendly but is not positively identified as a foe.\n\nThere are many reasons for friendly aircraft not to reply to IFF, such as battle\ndamage or equipment failure, loss of encryption keys, and wrong encryption keys.\nTerrain-hugging aircraft are very often poor candidates for microwave line-of-\nsight systems such as the IFF system. Microwaves cannot penetrate terrain, and\nvery often atmospheric effects (referred to as anomalous propagation) cause\ntiming, range, and azimuth issues.\n\nThe major military benefits of IFF include preventing \"friendly fire\" and being\nable to positively identify friendly forces.\n","linknr":205,"url":"Combat_Identification","recorded":1362668549,"links":41,"instances":["aviation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Applications of cryptography","Military terminology","Radio-frequency identification"],"headings":["History","Early 21st century systems","Modes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/IFF_camera.jpeg/300px-IFF_camera.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Model_XAE_IFF.jpg/220px-Model_XAE_IFF.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Erstling-geber.jpg/220px-Erstling-geber.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transponder","aviation"]],"members":["transponder"],"related":["Aircraft","Telecommunications","System","World_War_II","Anomalous_propagation","Azimuth","Friendly_fire","Erstling_IFF_transceiver","Freya_radar","WÃ¼rzburg_radar","UK","Royal_Air_Force","De_Havilland_Mosquito","World_War_II","Radar","Radio_beacon","NATO","STANAG","ADS-B","GPS","NATO","Automatic_target_recognition","Challenge-response_authentication","Cryptography","List_of_World_War_II_electronic_warfare_equipment","Radio-frequency_identification","Secondary_surveillance_radar","Transponder_(aviation)"]}
