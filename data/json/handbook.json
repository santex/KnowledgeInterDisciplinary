Nowadays it is often a simple but\nall-embracing treatment, containing concise information and being small enough\nto be held in the hand.\n\nA handbook is sometimes referred to as a '' (Latin, \"go with me\") or 'pocket\nreference' that is intended to be carried at all times. It may also be referred\nto as an enchiridion.\n\nHandbooks may deal with any topic, and are generally compendiums of information\nin a particular field or about a particular technique. They are designed to be\neasily consulted and provide quick answers in a certain area. For example, the\nMLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers is a reference for how to cite works\nin MLA style, among other things.\n\n\"Handbook\" is sometimes applied to documents that are produced within an\norganization that are not designed for publication—such as a company\nhandbook for HR, for instance. In this case, the term is used nearly\nsynonymously with \"manual.\"\n\nThe name \"handbook\" may sometimes be applied to reference works that are not pocket-\nsized, but do provide ready reference, as is the case with several engineering\nhandbooks such as [[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]], [[Marks Standard\nHandbook for Mechanical Engineers]], and the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and\nPhysics]]. Handbooks are widely used in the sciences as quick references for\nvarious kinds of data.\n","title":"handbook","headings":["See also","External links"]},"micro-relation":["1: Reference_work","1: Latin_language","1: MLA_Handbook_for_Writers_of_Research_Papers","1: Engineering","1: Compendium","1: Encyclopedia","1: Girdle_book","1: Owners_manual"]}
