WHO 2000\np.6 People are considered obese when their body\nmass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight in\nkilograms by the square of the person's height in metres, exceeds\n30 kg/m 2. WHO 2000 p.9\n\nObesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart\ndisease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and\nosteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a\ncombination of excessive food energy intake, lack of physical activity, and\ngenetic susceptibility, although a few cases are caused primarily by genes,\nendocrine disorders, medications or psychiatric illness. Evidence to support the\nview that some obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism\nis limited; on average obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their\nthin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body\nmass.\n\nDieting and physical exercise are the mainstays of treatment for obesity. Diet\nquality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods such\nas those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber.\nAnti-obesity drugs may be taken to reduce appetite or inhibit fat absorption\ntogether with a suitable diet. If diet, exercise and medication are not\neffective, a gastric balloon may assist with weight loss, or surgery may be\nperformed to reduce stomach volume and/or bowel length, leading to earlier\nsatiation and reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. NICE 2006\np.10â11\n\nObesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing\nprevalence in adults and children, and authorities view it as one of the most\nserious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world\n(particularly in the Western world), though it was widely perceived as a symbol\nof wealth and fertility at other times in history, and still is in some parts of\nthe world.\n","linknr":2065,"url":"Obesity","recorded":1362485128,"links":148,"instances":["biology","deadly_sin","mass","agriculture"],"pdf":["http://www.csdp.org/research/1238.pdf","http://www.csdp.org/research/1238.pdf","http://www.gojaznost.org/gs/dodatak/OMTFManagementofObesityinAdults2008.pdf","http://www.gojaznost.org/gs/dodatak/OMTFManagementofObesityinAdults2008.pdf","http://ipsdweb.ipsd.org/uploads/IPPC/CSM%20Media%20Health%20Report.pdf","http://ipsdweb.ipsd.org/uploads/IPPC/CSM%20Media%20Health%20Report.pdf","http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfs_obesity.pdf","http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/media/en/gsfs_obesity.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG43NICEGuideline.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG43NICEGuideline.pdf","http://www.iotf.org/database/documents/GlobalPrevalenceofAdultObesity16thDecember08.pdf","http://www.iotf.org/database/documents/GlobalPrevalenceofAdultObesity16thDecember08.pdf","http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf","http://medind.nic.in/iae/t07/i4/iaet07i4p243.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf","http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG43NICEGuideline.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG43NICEGuideline.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_894_(part1).pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_894_(part1).pdf"],"categories":["Obesity|","Bariatrics","Body
