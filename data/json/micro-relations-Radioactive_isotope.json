During this process, the\nradionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay, resulting in the emission of\ngamma ray(s) and/or subatomic particles such as alpha or beta\nparticles. R.H. Petrucci, W.S. Harwood and F.G. Herring, General Chemistry\n(8th ed., Prentice-Hall 2002), p.1025-26 These emissions constitute\nionizing radiation. Radionuclides occur naturally, or can be produced\nartificially.\n\nRadionuclides are often referred to by chemists and physicists as 'radioactive\n[[isotope]]s' or 'radioisotopes'. Radioisotopes with suitable half-lives play an\nimportant part in a number of technologies (for example, nuclear medicine).\nRadionuclides can also present both real and perceived dangers to health.\n\nThe number of radionuclides is uncertain because the number of very short-lived\nradionuclides that have yet to be characterized is extremely large and\npotentially unquantifiable. Even the number of long-lived radionuclides is\nuncertain (to a lesser degree), because many \"stable\" nuclides are calculated to\nhave half-lives so long that their decay has not been experimentally measured.\nThe total list of nuclides contains 90 nuclides that are theoretically stable,\nand 255 total stable nuclides that have not been observed to decay. In addition,\nthere exist about 650 radionuclides that have been experimentally observed to\ndecay, with half-lives longer than 60 minutes (see list of nuclides for this\nlist). Of these, about 339 are known from nature (they have been observed on\nEarth, and not as a consequence of man-made activities).\n\nIncluding artificially produced nuclides, more than 3300 nuclides are known\n(including ~3000 radionuclides), many of which (> ~2400) have decay half-lives\nshorter than 60 minutes. This list expands as new radionuclides with very short\nhalf-lives are characterized.\n\nAll elements form a number of radionuclides, although the half lives of many are\ntoo short for them to be observed in nature. Even the lightest element,\nhydrogen, has a well-known radioisotope, tritium. The heaviest elements (heavier\nthan bismuth) exist only as radionuclides. For every chemical element, many\nradioisotopes that do not occur in nature (due to short half lives or the lack\nof an ongoing natural production mechanism), have been produced artificially.\n","linknr":471,"url":"Radioactive_isotope","recorded":1362507545,"links":54,"instances":["microbiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radioactivity","Isotopes","Nuclear physics","Nuclear chemistry"],"headings":["Origin","Uses","Common examples","Dangers","Summary table for classes of nuclides, \"stable\" and radioactive","List of commercially available radionuclides","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Americium-241.jpg/220px-Americium-241.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Americium-241_Sample_from_Smoke_Detector.JPG/220px-Americium-241_Sample_from_Smoke_Detector.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sterilisation","microbiology"],["table_of_nuclides","segmented,_wide"]],"members":["table_of_nuclides","sterilisation"],"related":["Atom","Atomic_nucleus","Internal_conversion","Radioactive_decay","Gamma_ray","Subatomic_particle","Alpha_particle","Beta_particle","Ionizing_radiation","Nuclear_medicine","List_of_nuclides","Stable_nuclide","List_of_nuclides","Hydrogen","Tritium","Bismuth","Cosmogenic","Uranium","Thorium","Star","Half-life","Carbon-14","Cosmic_ray","Nuclear_reactor","Neutron","Isotopes_of_thallium","Iridium-192","Neutron_cross-section","Cyclotron","Fluorine-18","Technetium-99m_generator","Nuclear_medicine","Molybdenum-99","Half-life","Nuclear_reaction","Radiation","Carbon","Radioactive_tracer","Geiger_counter","Carbon_dioxide","Nuclear_medicine","Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography","Positron_emission_tomography","Cerenkov_luminescence_imaging","Hemopoietic","Sterilisation_(microbiology)","Biochemistry","Genetics","DNA_replication","Amino_acid","Food_preservation","Food_irradiation","Industry","Mining","Geology","Archaeology","Paleontology","Smoke_detector","Nuclear_reactor","Americium-241","Alpha_particle","Gamma_radiation","Neptunium-237","Americium_dioxide","Ionization_chamber","Ion","Plutonium-241","Uranium-238","Gadolinium-153","Osteoporosis","Nuclear_medicine","Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography","X-ray","Europium","Isotope_separation","Calcium","Radioactive_contamination","Radiation_poisoning","List_of_nuclides","List_of_nuclides","Primordial_nuclide","Nuclear_transmutation","List_of_nuclides","List_of_nuclides","Running_total","Proton_decay","Spontaneous_fission","Niobium-93","Stable_nuclide","Primordial_nuclide","Uranium","Thorium","Bismuth","Rubidium-97","Potassium-40","Carbon-14","Cosmic_rays","Radium","Polonium","Radiotracer","List_of_nuclides","Isotope_lists","Table_of_nuclides_(segmented,_wide)","Specific_activity","Electronvolt","Barium-133","Cadmium-109","Cobalt-57","Cobalt-60","Europium-152","Manganese-54","Sodium-22","Zinc-65","Technetium-99m","Strontium-90","Thallium-204","Carbon-14","Tritium","Polonium-210","Uranium-238","Caesium-137","Americium-241","List_of_nuclides","Hyperaccumulators_table_â€“_3","Radioactivity_in_biology","Radiometric_dating","Radionuclide_cisternogram","Radionuclides_associated_with_hydraulic_fracturing"]}
