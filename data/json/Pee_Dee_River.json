It originates in the Appalachian Mountains in\nNorth Carolina, where its upper course, above the mouth of the Uwharrie River is\nknown as the Yadkin River. It is extensively dammed for flood control and\nhydroelectric power. The lower part of the river is named Pee Dee (in colonial\ntimes written Pedee) after the Native American Pee Dee tribe. The Pee Dee region\nof South Carolina, composed of the northeastern counties of the state, was named\nafter the tribe and/or river. The first Europeans believed to have navigated\npart of the river was a party sent by Lucas VÃ¡zquez de AyllÃ³n in 1521. They\nnamed it \"River of St. John the Baptist.\"\n\nNavigable up to the fall line at Cheraw, the river was an important trade route\nthrough the Low Country from colonial times. The largest lumber company in the\nworld existed at the turn of the 20th century near the river's mouth at\nGeorgetown. The virgin pine forests of the Pee Dee region were cut over, and the\nlogs floated in rafts downriver to be sawn into lumber and exported to the\nnorthern USA and Europe.\n\nThe lower part of the river flood plain was extensively developed for rice\nculture in colonial time; rice was the major export of the area from the port at\nGeorgetown. Rice culture declined with the loss of slave labor after the Civil\nWar, and increased overseas competition. Two hurricanes at the beginning of the\n20th century destroyed much of the rice canal infrastructure and effectively\nended the remnants of rice culture.\n\nToday the river is not extensively used for navigation. It is an important\nsource of electric power and public water supplies, as well as recreational use.\nWhile the Pee Dee is free-flowing in South Carolina, upstream in North Carolina,\nseveral dams have been constructed on it. The opening and closing of these dams\ncauses dramatic swings in the depth of the river in South Carolina. The sharing\nof water between the two states has sometimes been a matter of controversy,\nparticularly during period of drought. Some commercial fishing is done during\nthe winter shad run, and for shrimp in the lower reaches. The river is excellent\nfor recreational fishing and boating. There are numerous boat landings, yet most\nof the river is wild, with forests of tupelo, oak and gum along its shores.\nHerons and alligators can be seen along the way, and a lucky sighting of a bald\neagle is possible.\n\nThe lower part of the river from Highway 378 to Winyah Bay has been designated a\nScenic River. [http://www.dnr.sc.gov/water/envaff/river/desig_rivers.html]\n\nSome tributaries are the Lumber, the Little Pee Dee, Lynches, Black and Waccamaw\nrivers. The river empties into Winyah Bay, and then into the Atlantic Ocean near\nGeorgetown.\n\nSnow's Island is a large island at the junction of the Pee Dee and Lynches\nrivers. This was headquarters for General Francis Marion during the American\nRevolution. It proved a safe haven for him and his ragtag militia troops, as the\nBritish were never able to find the camp. It has been identified as the center\nof an old meteor crater).\n\nThe Pee Dee River was the original river for Stephen Foster's song \"Old Folks at\nHome\" (commonly known by its first line, \"Way down upon the Swanee River\"). Why\nhe changed the name of the river in his final version of the song is a subject\nof much speculation.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Pee_Dee_River","recorded":1375085434,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pee_Dee_River&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pee_Dee_River&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Pee_Dee_River&params=34_43_16_N_79_52_54_W_type:river_region:US-NC","/wiki/File:Shadfishing8418.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Shadfishing8418.JPG","/wiki/Shad","/wiki/Pee_Dee_(tribe)","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/South_Carolina","/wiki/Uwharrie_River","/wiki/Yadkin_River","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Pee_Dee_River&params=35_22_51_N_80_3_29_W_type:river_region:US-NC","#cite_note-gnis-1","/wiki/Winyah_Bay","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Pee_Dee_River&params=34_43_16_N_79_52_54_W_type:river_region:US-NC","#cite_note-gnis-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/File:Peedeerivermap.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Peedeerivermap.png/300px-Peedeerivermap.png","/wiki/River","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/South_Carolina","/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains","/wiki/North_Carolina","/wiki/Uwharrie_River","/wiki/Yadkin_River","/wiki/Hydroelectric","/wiki/Native_Americans_of_the_United_States","/wiki/Pee_Dee_(tribe)","/wiki/Pee_Dee","/wiki/Lucas_V%C3%A1zquez_de_Ayll%C3%B3n","/wiki/Navigable","/wiki/Wikipedia:PCR","/wiki/Fall_line","/wiki/Cheraw,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Lumber","/wiki/Georgetown,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Pine","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Europe","/wiki/Flood_plain","/wiki/Rice","/wiki/Slavery","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Hurricanes","/wiki/Electric_power","/wiki/Shad","/wiki/Shrimp","/wiki/Tupelo","/wiki/Oak","/wiki/Black_tupelo","/wiki/Heron","/wiki/Alligator","/wiki/Bald_eagle","/wiki/Winyah_Bay","http://www.dnr.sc.gov/water/envaff/river/desig_rivers.html","/wiki/Lumber_River","/wiki/Little_Pee_Dee_River","/wiki/Lynches_River","/wiki/Black_River_(South_Carolina)","/wiki/Waccamaw_River","/wiki/Winyah_Bay","/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean","/wiki/Francis_Marion","/wiki/American_Revolution","/wiki/Militia","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Meteor","/wiki/Impact_crater","/wiki/Stephen_Foster","/wiki/Old_Folks_at_Home","/w/index.php?title=Pee_Dee_River&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_North_Carolina_rivers","/wiki/List_of_South_Carolina_rivers","/wiki/Yadkin_River","/wiki/Yadkin-Pee_Dee_River_Basin","/w/index.php?title=Pee_Dee_River&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-gnis_1-0","#cite_ref-gnis_1-1","http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1251573","#cite_ref-2","http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pee_Dee_River&oldid=559461087","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Rivers_of_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Rivers_of_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Chesterfield_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Marlboro_County,_South_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Anson_County,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Richmond_County,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Montgomery_County,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Geography_of_Stanly_County,_North_Carolina","/wiki/Category:Yadkin-Pee_Dee_River_Basin","/wiki/Category:Geobox_usage_tracking_for_river_type","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_context_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pee+Dee+River&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pee+Dee+River","/wiki/Pee_Dee_River","/wiki/Talk:Pee_Dee_River","#","/wiki/Pee_Dee_River","/w/index.php?title=Pee_Dee_River&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pee_Dee_River&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal"
