The seller of such goods and services\nis referred to as an \"exporter\" who is based in the country of export whereas\nthe overseas based buyer is referred to as an \"importer\". In International\nTrade, \"exports\" refers to selling goods and services produced in the home\ncountry to other markets. Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2005) International\nMarketing, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York ISBN 0-19-567123-\n6 Export should be high then only our Foreign Currency will increase\n\nExport of commercial quantities of goods normally requires involvement of the\ncustoms authorities in both the country of export and the country of import. The\nadvent of small trades over the internet such as through Amazon and eBay have\nlargely bypassed the involvement of Customs in many countries because of the low\nindividual values of these trades. Nonetheless, these small exports are still\nsubject to legal restrictions applied by the country of export. An export's\ncounterpart is an import.\n","linknr":473,"url":"export","recorded":1362581688,"links":65,"instances":["pricing_policy","economics","business"],"pdf":["http://www.crfonline.org/orc/pdf/exportstrategy.pdf","http://www.crfonline.org/orc/pdf/exportstrategy.pdf"],"categories":["Commercial item transport and distribution","International trade"],"headings":["Definition","History","Process","National regulations","Barriers","Exports and free trade","Export strategy","Challenges","See also","Notes","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Storck_Harbour_scene.jpg/180px-Storck_Harbour_scene.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Hamburg.CTA.Altenwerder.BungaRaya.wmt.jpg/300px-Hamburg.CTA.Altenwerder.BungaRaya.wmt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dumping","pricing_policy"],["distribution","business"],["service","economics"],["distribution","business"],["distribution","business"]],"members":["dumping","service","distribution"],"related":["Rakesh_Mohan_Joshi","Amazon.com","EBay","Import","United_States_Munitions_List","USML","United_States_Department_of_State","International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations","ITAR","Bureau_of_Industry_and_Security","Code_of_Federal_Regulations","Cuba","North_Korea","Sudan","Syria","Iran","Transhipped","Export_license_requirements","Canadian_Export_and_Import_Controls_Bureau","Export_Promotion_Bureau,_Bangladesh","Trade_barrier","Regulation","Policies","Stimulate","Restrictive_business","Impede","International_exchange","Archaeological_artefact","Nuclear_Suppliers_Group","Australia_Group","Missile_Technology_Control_Regime","Wassenaar_Arrangement","Tariff","Subsidies","Dumping_(pricing_policy)","United_States_steel_tariff_2002","World_Trade_Organization","Public_Broadcasting_Service","European_Union","Comparative_advantage","David_Ricardo","James_Mill","Robert_Torrens","Mercantilism","Market_manipulation","Australian_Government","Canadian_Government","Credit_Research_Foundation","Assets","Value_chain","Financial_risk","Internationalization","Core_competence","License","Outsource","Eclectic_paradigm","Foreign_direct_investment","Rate_of_return","International_business","Marketing_management","Small_and_medium_enterprises","Trade_regulation","Foreign_exchange_market","Prentice_Hall","Exchange-rate","Management","Direct_selling","Distribution_(business)","Retailing","Service_(economics)","International_marketing","Distribution_(business)","Distribution_(business)","Retailing","Electronic_commerce","Electronic_commerce","Customer","Customers","Intermediary","U.S._Department_of_Commerce","Export_Yellow_Pages","Embassies","Trade_center","Consulate","Kelly's_Directory","India","Alibaba.com","China","Commodity_currency","Commodity_Classification_Automated_Tracking_System","Export-oriented_industrialization","Export_performance","Export-led_growth","List_of_countries_by_exports","Sales","International_trade","Import"]}
