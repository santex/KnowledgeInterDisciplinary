{"cursor":"1714","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn a telecommunications network or computer network, 'downstream' refers to data\nsent from a network service provider to a customer.\n\n\nAlthough the best voiceband modems are called 56 kbit/s modems, downstream\nspeeds can be limited to a few tens of kilobits per second with even lower\nupstream speeds. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and cable modems, two\npopular Internet access technologies, greatly improved downstream speeds\nreaching several Mbit/s. Mobile broadband and satellite Internet access\nproviders also often have lower upstream speeds than downstream.\n\nOne process sending data primarily in the downstream direction is\n[[download]]ing. However, the overall download speed depends on the\ndownstream speed of the user, the upstream speed of the server, and the\nnetwork between them.\n\nIn the clientâserver model, downstream can refer to the direction from the\nserver to the client.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Downstream_(networking)","recorded":1362538228,"links":19,"instances":["networking","computing","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data transmission"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Upstream-downstream.svg/260px-Upstream-downstream.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Crystal_Clear_app_network.png/35px-Crystal_Clear_app_network.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["server","computing"],["client","computing"],["upstream","networking"]],"members":["upstream","client","server"],"related":["Telecommunications_network","Computer_network","Voiceband","Modems","56_kbit/s_modem","Bits_per_second","Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line","Cable_modem","Internet_access","Mobile_broadband","Satellite_Internet_access","Client–server_model","Server_(computing)","Client_(computing)","Upstream_(networking)"]}
