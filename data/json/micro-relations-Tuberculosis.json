Tuberculosis typically attacks the\nlungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It is spread through the air\nwhen people who have an active TB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit\ntheir saliva through the air. Most infections are\nasymptomatic and latent, but about one in ten latent infections eventually\nprogresses to active disease which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of\nthose so infected.\n\nThe classic symptoms of active TB infection are a chronic cough with blood-\ntinged sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss (the latter giving rise\nto the formerly prevalent term \"consumption\"). Infection of other organs\ncauses a wide range of symptoms. Diagnosis of active TB relies on radiology\n(commonly chest X-rays), as well as microscopic examination and\nmicrobiological culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the\ntuberculin skin test (TST) and/or blood tests. Treatment is difficult and\nrequires administration of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time.\nSocial contacts are also screened and treated if necessary. Antibiotic\nresistance is a growing problem in multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-\nTB) infections. Prevention relies on screening programs and vaccination with\nthe bacillus Calmette–GuÃ©rin vaccine.\n\nOne third of the world's population is thought to have been infected with M.\ntuberculosis, with new infections occurring at a\nrate of about one per second. In 2007, there were an\nestimated 13.7 million chronic active cases globally, while in 2010, there were an estimated 8.8 million new\ncases and 1.5 million associated deaths, mostly occurring in developing\ncountries. The absolute number of tuberculosis cases has\nbeen decreasing since 2006, and new cases have decreased since 2002. The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform across the globe;\nabout 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in\ntuberculin tests, while only 5â10% of the United States population tests\npositive. More people in the developing world contract\ntuberculosis because of compromised immunity, largely due to high rates of HIV\ninfection and the corresponding development of AIDS.\n","linknr":1750,"url":"Tuberculosis","recorded":1362505897,"links":165,"instances":["epidemiology","epidemiology","biology","biology","medicine","biology","epidemiology","uk","medical","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://who.int/entity/tb/publications/global_report/2009/pdf/chapter1.pdf","http://who.int/entity/tb/publications/global_report/2009/pdf/chapter1.pdf","http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2011/gtbr11_executive_summary.pdf","http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2011/gtbr11_executive_summary.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/corecurr/pdf/corecurr_all.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/corecurr/pdf/corecurr_all.pdf","http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2011/gtbr11_full.pdf","http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2011/gtbr11_full.pdf","http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2006/pdf/full_report_correctedversion.pdf","http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2006/pdf/full_report_correctedversion.pdf","http://www.ceev.net/biocultural.pdf","http://www.ceev.net/biocultural.pdf","http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/79(8)735.pdf","http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/79(8)735.pdf"],"categories":["Tuberculosis|
