[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world Merriam-\nwebster.com]\n\nIn a philosophical context it may refer to:\n# the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world (see [[world\n# disclosure]]).\nIn a theological context, world usually refers to the material or the profane\nsphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred. The \"end\nof the world\" refers to scenarios of the final end of human history, often in\nreligious contexts.\n\nWorld history is commonly understood as spanning the major geopolitical\ndevelopments of about five millennia, from the first civilizations to\nthe present.\n\nWorld population is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly,\nworld economy is the sum of the economies of all societies (all countries),\nespecially in the context of globalization. Terms like world championship, gross\nworld product, world flags etc. also imply the sum or combination of all current-\nday sovereign states.\n\nIn terms such as world religion, world language, and world war, world suggests\ninternational or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying\nparticipation of the entire world.\n\nIn terms such as world map and world climate, world is used in the sense\ndetached from human culture or civilization, referring to the planet Earth\nphysically.\n","linknr":364,"url":"World","recorded":1362555150,"links":97,"instances":["cosmogony","eastern_orthodox_theology","religion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Earth","World|"],"headings":["Etymology and usage","Philosophy","Religion and mythology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/300px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/1-12_Blue-White_Map_World.png/300px-1-12_Blue-White_Map_World.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Flag_of_WHO.svg/300px-Flag_of_WHO.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg/300px-The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights_by_Bosch_High_Resolution.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Yggdrasil.jpg/300px-Yggdrasil.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chaos","cosmogony"],["theosis","eastern_orthodox_theology"],["transcendence","religion"]],"members":["chaos","theosis","transcendence"],"related":["Apollo_17","World_map","Azimuthal_equidistant_projection","Rod_of_Asclepius","Axis_mundi","Human","Civilization","Experience","History","Human_condition","Earth","Universe","Ontology","Eschatology","World_history","Cradle_of_civilization","World_population","World_economy","Globalization","World_championship","Gross_world_product","World_flags","Sovereign_state","World_religion","World_language","World_war","World_map","World_climate","Earth","English_language","Old_English","Common_Germanic","Old_Saxon","Old_High_German","Old_Frisian","Old_Norse","Icelandic_language","Latin","Midgard","Chthonic","Creation_myth","Chaos_(cosmogony)","Planet","Population","Country","Region","History","World_community","Heavenly_body","Science_fiction","Futurology","Human","Experience","Career","Academia","Fashion_house","Consumer","Fashion_industry","Age_of_discovery","New_World_monkey","Hieronymus_Bosch","Paradise","Hell","Flat_earth","Firmament","Reality","Universe","Ontology","World_disclosure","Concept","Western_philosophy","Parmenides","Allegory_of_the_Cave","Plato","Hegel","Philosophy_of_history","Arthur_Schopenhauer","Ludwig_Wittgenstein","Logical_positivism","Martin_Heidegger","World_disclosure","Sigmund_Freud","David_Kellogg_Lewis","Possible_world","Modal_realism","World_tree","Heaven","Underworld","Mythological_cosmology","Axis_mundi","Oceanus","JÃ¶rmungandr","Buddhism","Monastery","Enlightenment_in_Buddhism","Christianity","Fall_of_man","World_to_Come","Temptation","Monk","Jesus","Alfred_the_Great","Jesus","Gospel_of_John","Catholic_imagination","Jean_Delumeau","Second_Vatican_Council","Asceticism","Theosis_(Eastern_Orthodox_theology)","Evagrius_Ponticus","Philokalia","Ladder_of_Divine_Ascent","John_Climacus","Transcendence_(religion)","Hesychasm","Theoria","Urbi_et_Orbi","Christendom","Papal_supremacy","Islamic_world","Globe","List_of_sovereign_states","Universe"]}
