It took place\nin the valley of the CÃ´a River and it was the first significant battle for the\nnew army of 65,000 men controlled by Marshal AndrÃ© MassÃ©na, as the French\nprepared for their third invasion of Portugal.\n\nAs the British-Portuguese forces were outnumbered here, on July 22, General\nArthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington sent Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd\na letter, saying that he (Wellington) was \"not desirous of engaging in an affair\nbeyond the Coa.\" On July 24, Craufurd's Light Division, with 4,200 infantry, 800\ncavalry, and six guns, was surprised by the sight of 20,000 troops under Marshal\nMichel Ney. Rather than retreat and cross the river as ordered by Wellington,\nCraufurd chose to engage the French, narrowly avoiding disaster.\n\nThe French objective was to force the Light Division back across the CÃ´a in\norder to besiege Almeida. They succeeded after hard fighting, but then launched\na costly assault across the CÃ´a, suffering heavy casualties.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Battle_of_Coa","recorded":1362478005,"links":19,"instances":["the_chestnut_troop_royal_horse_artillery","monmouthshire_regiment_of_foot","oxfordshire_regiment_of_foot","british_army_general"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Battles of the Peninsular War|Coa 1810","Battles involving Portugal|Côa","Battles involving France|Côa","Battles involving the United Kingdom|Côa","1810 in Portugal","Conflicts in 1810"],"headings":["Battle of the River Côa","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/22px-Flag_of_France.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/PortugueseFlag1750.png/22px-PortugueseFlag1750.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/LocalVilaNovaDeFozCoa.svg/220px-LocalVilaNovaDeFozCoa.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["43rd","monmouthshire_regiment_of_foot"],["52nd","oxfordshire_regiment_of_foot"],["george_anson","british_army_general"],["a_battery","the_chestnut_troop_royal_horse_artillery"]],"members":["a_battery","43rd","52nd","george_anson"],"related":["Peninsular_War","Côa_River","First_French_Empire","United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland","Kingdom_of_Portugal","Michel_Ney","Robert_Craufurd","Peninsular_War","Napoleonic_Wars","Côa","André_Masséna","Anglo-Portuguese_Army","Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington","Robert_Craufurd","Light_Division","Michel_Ney","Almeida_Municipality","Light_Division","Robert_Craufurd","43rd_(Monmouthshire)_Regiment_of_Foot","Rifle_Brigade","52nd_(Oxfordshire)_Regiment_of_Foot","George_Anson_(British_Army_general)","16th_Light_Dragoons","King's_German_Legion","A_Battery_(The_Chestnut_Troop)_Royal_Horse_Artillery","Royal_Horse_Artillery","Julien_Augustin_Joseph_Mermet","Louis_Henri_Loison","Claude_François_Ferey"]}
