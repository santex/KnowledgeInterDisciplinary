The\nblastula precedes the formation of the gastrula in which the germ layers of the\nembryo form.\n\nA common feature of a vertebrate blastula is that it consists of a layer of\nblastomeres, known as the blastoderm, which surrounds the\nblastocoel. ForgÃ¡cs & Newman, 2005:\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&pg=PA27 p. 27] In mammals\nthe blastula is referred to as a blastocyst. The blastocyst contains an\nembryoblast (or inner cell mass) that will eventually give rise to the\ndefinitive structures of the fetus, and the trophoblast, which goes on to form\nthe extra-embryonic tissues.\n\nDuring the blastula stage of developoment, a significant amount of activity\noccurs within the early embryo to establish cell polarity, cell specification,\naxis formation, and regulate gene expression. In many\nspecies such as Drosophila and Xenopus, the mid blastula transition (MBT) is a\ncrucial step in development during which the maternal mRNA is degraded and\ncontrol over development is passed to the embryo.\nMany of the interactions between blastomeres are dependent on cadherin\nexpression, particularly E-cadherin in mammals and EP-cadherin in\namphibians.\n\nThe study of the blastula and of cell specification has many implications on the\nfield of stem cell research as well as the continued improvement of fertility\ntreatments. Embryonic stem cells are a field which, though\ncontroversial, have tremendous potential for treating disease. In Xenopus,\nblastomeres behave as pluripotent stem cells which can migrate down several\npathways, depending on cell signaling. By manipulating\nthe cell signals during the blastula stage of development, various tissues can\nbe formed. This potential can be instrumental in regenerative medicine for\ndisease and injury cases. In vitro fertilisation involves implantation of a\nblastula into a motherâs uterus. Blastula cell implantation\ncould potentially serve to eliminate infertility.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"blastula","recorded":1372154296,"links":[],"instances":["genetics","biology","gene","embryo"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology","Cloning"],"headings":["Development","Structure","Clinical implications","See also","Notes","Further reading"],"image":[],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["cleavage","embryo"],["cdh1","gene"],["transcription","genetics"],["cdh1","gene"]],"members":["transcription","cell","cdh1","cleavage"],"related":["Morula","Gastrula","Blastoderm","Cell_(biology)","Blastomere","Blastocoele","Embryonic_development","Animals","Embryo","Zygote","Cleavage_(embryo)","Morula","Gastrula","Germ_layer","Vertebrate","Blastoderm","Mammal","Blastocyst","Embryoblast","Trophoblast","Cell_polarity","Cell_fate_determination","Regional_specification","Gene_expression","Drosophila","Xenopus","Midblastula","Maternal_effect","Cadherin","CDH1_(gene)","Embryonic_stem_cells","Assisted_reproductive_technology","Cell_potency","Cell_signaling","Regenerative_medicine","In_vitro_fertilisation","Infertility","Cleavage_furrow","Tight_junctions","Drosophila","Cell_cycle","G1_phase","G2_phase","Transcription_(genetics)","MicroRNA","Amino_acid","Protein","Growth_factor","Cellular_differentiation","Gastrulation","Ectoderm","Mesoderm","Endoderm","Epiblast","Placenta","Yolk_sac","Sodium_potassium_ATPase","Aquaporin","Epithelium","Paracellular_transport","CDH1_(gene)","Alpha_catenin","Beta_catenin","Catenin","Epithelial_polarity","Phenotype","Ovulation_induction","Ovarian_hyperstimulation","Artificial_insemination","Transcription_factor","Retina","Neural_plate","Blastocyst","Cellular_differentiation","Gastrulation","Polarity_in_embryogenesis"]}
