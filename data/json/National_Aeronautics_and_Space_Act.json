The Act,\nwhich followed close on the heels of the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, was\ndrafted by the United States House Select Committee on Astronautics and Space\nExploration and on July 29, 1958 was signed by President Eisenhower. Prior to\nenactment, the responsibility for space exploration was deemed primarily a\nmilitary venture, in line with the Soviet model that had launched the first\norbital satellite. In large measure, the Act was prompted by the lack of\nresponse by a US military infrastructure that seemed incapable of keeping up the\nspace race.\n\nThe act specifically charged the new Agency with eight objectives, including\nâthe establishment of long-range studies of the potential benefits to be gained\nfrom, the opportunities for, and the problems involved in the utilization of\naeronautical and space activities for peaceful and scientific purposes.â\n\nThe Act abolished the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, transferring\nits activities and resources to NASA effective October 1, 1958. The Act also\ncreated a Civilian-Military Liaison Committee, for the purpose of coordinating\ncivilian and military space applications, and keeping NASA and the Department of\nDefense \"fully and currently informed\" of each other's space activities. To this\nday, the United States has coordinated but separate military and civilian space\nprograms, with much of the former involved in launching military and\nsurveillance craft and, prior to the Partial Test Ban Treaty, planning counter-\nmeasures to the anticipated Soviet launch of nuclear warheads into space.\n\nIn addition, the new law made extensive modifications to the patent law and\nprovided that both employee inventions as well as private contractor innovations\nbrought about through space travel would be subject to government ownership. By\nmaking the government the exclusive provider of space transport, the act\neffectively discouraged the private development of space travel. This situation\nendured until the law was modified by the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984,\nenacted to allow civilian use of NASA systems in launching space\nvehicles. http://www.space.edu/LibraryResearch/565TP.html\n\nThe phrase \"We came in peace for all mankind\", inscribed on a plaque left on the\nMoon by the crew of Apollo 11, is derived from the Act's declaration of NASA's\npolicy and purpose: :The Congress hereby declares that it is the policy of the\nUnited States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes\nfor the benefit of all mankind. [http://history.nasa.gov/spaceact.html The\nNational Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (unamended)]\n\nThe Act was subsequently amended to remove gender bias, so that this policy\nstatement now reads: :Devotion of Space Activities to Peaceful Purposes for\nBenefit of All Humankind.--Congress declares that it is the policy of the United\nStates that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the\nbenefit of all\nhumankind.
