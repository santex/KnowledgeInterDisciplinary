He is\ncurrently the White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford\nand a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.\n\nBroome was educated at the University of Cambridge, at the University of London\nand at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a PhD in\neconomics. Before arriving at Oxford he was Professor of Philosophy at the\nUniversity of St. Andrews and, prior to that, Professor of Economics and\nPhilosophy at the University of Bristol. He has held visiting posts at the\nUniversity of Virginia, the Australian National University, Princeton\nUniversity, the University of Washington, the University of British Columbia,\nthe Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences, and the\nUniversity of Canterbury. In 2007 Broome was elected a Foreign Member of the\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nHis book Weighing Goods (1991) explores the way in which goods \"located\" in each\nof the three \"dimensions\" — time, people, states of natureâmake up overall\ngoodness. Broome argues that these dimensions are linked by what he calls the\ninterpersonal addition theorem, which supports the utilitarian principle of\ndistribution. In his book Weighing Lives (2004), Broome rejects the presumed\nintuition that adding people to the population is ethically neutral. In his\ncollection of papers, titled Ethics out of Economics (1999), he discusses topics\nsuch as value, equality, fairness, and utility.\n","linknr":125,"url":"John_Broome_(philosopher)","recorded":1362897114,"links":12,"instances":["social","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Living people","British philosophers","1947 births","Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford","Fellows of Corpus Christi College, Oxford"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["norm","social"],["value","economics"]],"members":["norm","value"],"related":["Contemporary_philosophy","United_Kingdom","Analytic_philosophy","Economics","Norm_(social)","Ethics","Great_Britain","Philosopher","Economist","White's_Chair_of_Moral_Philosophy","University_of_Oxford","Fellow","Corpus_Christi_College,_Oxford","University_of_Cambridge","University_of_London","Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology","Economics","University_of_St._Andrews","University_of_Bristol","University_of_Virginia","Australian_National_University","Princeton_University","University_of_Washington","University_of_British_Columbia","Swedish_Collegium_for_Advanced_Study_in_the_Social_Sciences","University_of_Canterbury","Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences","Utilitarianism","Value_(economics)","Egalitarianism","Social_justice","Utility","Derek_Parfit","United_Kingdom"]}
