To the left of the main stack, a new identical oven\nline is under construction (March 2007).]]\n\n'Incineration' is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of\norganic substances contained in waste materials. Incineration and\nother high temperature waste treatment systems are described as \"thermal\ntreatment\". Incineration of waste materials converts the waste into ash, flue\ngas, and heat. The ash is mostly formed by the inorganic constituents of the\nwaste, and may take the form of solid lumps or particulates carried by the flue\ngas. The flue gases must be cleaned of gaseous and particulate pollutants before\nthey are dispersed into the atmosphere. In some cases, the heat generated by\nincineration can be used to generate electric power.\n\nIncineration with energy recovery is one of several waste-to-energy (WtE)\ntechnologies such as gasification, plasma arc gasification, pyrolysis and\nanaerobic digestion. Incineration may also be implemented without energy and\nmaterials recovery.\n\nIn several countries, there are still concerns from experts and local\ncommunities about the environmental impact of incinerators (see arguments\nagainst incineration).\n\nIn some countries, incinerators built just a few decades ago often did not\ninclude a materials separation to remove hazardous, bulky or recyclable\nmaterials before combustion. These facilities tended to risk the health of the\nplant workers and the local environment due to inadequate levels of gas cleaning\nand combustion process control. Most of these facilities did not generate\nelectricity.\n\nIncinerators reduce the solid mass of the original waste by 80â85% and the\nvolume (already compressed somewhat in garbage trucks) by 95-96%, depending on\ncomposition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for\nrecycling. This means that while incineration\ndoes not completely replace landfilling, it significantly reduces the necessary\nvolume for disposal. Garbage trucks often reduce the volume of waste in a built-\nin compressor before delivery to the incinerator. Alternatively, at landfills,\nthe volume of the uncompressed garbage can be reduced by approximately 70% by\nusing a stationary steel compressor, albeit with a significant energy cost. In\nmany countries, simpler waste compaction is a common practice for compaction at\nlandfills.\n\nIncineration has particularly strong benefits for the treatment of certain waste\ntypes in niche areas such as clinical wastes and certain hazardous wastes where\npathogens and toxins can be destroyed by high temperatures. Examples include\nchemical multi-product plants with diverse toxic or very toxic wastewater\nstreams, which cannot be routed to a conventional wastewater treatment plant.\n\nWaste combustion is particularly popular in countries such as Japan where land\nis a scarce resource. Denmark and Sweden have been leaders in using the energy\ngenerated from incineration for more than a century, in localised combined heat\nand power facilities supporting district heating schemes. In 2005,\nwaste incineration produced 4.8% of the electricity consumption and 13.7% of the\ntotal domestic heat consumption in Denmark. A number of other\nEuropean countries rely heavily on incineration for handling municipal waste, in\nparticular Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and France.\n","linknr":904,"url":"Incineration","recorded":1362507303,"links":94,"instances":["element","waste","chemistry","video_game","tool"],"pdf":["http://www.oneia.ca/files/EFW%20-%20Knox.pdf","http://www.oneia.ca/files/EFW%20-%20Knox.pdf","http://www.legis.state.wi.us/rsb/code/nr/nr502.pdf","http://vestforbraending.dk/Om_VF/Tekniske_anlaeg/Anl%E6g_6_oktober_2004.pdf","http://vestforbraending.dk/Om_VF/Tekniske_anlaeg/Anl%E6g_6_oktober_2004.pdf","http://www.hitemptech.com/downloads/HTTSolidWasteRotaryKilnQuotation.pdf","http://www.hitemptech.com/downloads/HTTSolidWasteRotaryKilnQuotation.pdf","http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/Waste_Incineration_A_Potential_Danger.pdf","http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/sofos/Waste_Incineration_A_Potential_Danger.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/ttn/catc/dir1/barlbrn2.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/ttn/catc/dir1/barlbrn2.pdf","http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/environment/waste/docs/greenhousegas/greenhousegasbalances.pdf","http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/environment/waste/docs/greenhousegas/greenhousegasbalances.pdf","http://www2.dmu.dk/1_viden/2_Publikationer/3_fagrapporter/rapporter/FR442.pdf","http://www2.dmu.dk/1_viden/2_Publikationer/3_fagrapporter/rapporter/FR442.pdf","http://www.sysav.se/upload/ovrigt/AKV%20stor%20sv.pdf","http://www.sysav.se/upload/ovrigt/AKV%20stor%20sv.pdf","http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/NQ27620.pdf","http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/NQ27620.pdf","http://wte.org/userfiles/file/090421%20Waxman%20ltr%20re%20ACESA.pdf","http://wte.org/userfiles/file/090421%20Waxman%20ltr%20re%20ACESA.pdf","http://www.precautionaryprinciple.ca/pdfs/IBA_risk_assessment.pdf","http://www.precautionaryprinciple.ca/pdfs/IBA_risk_assessment.pdf","http://www.grundon.com/PDFs/leaflets/technical/Haz_Landfill_Flyer_Mar_2004.pdf","http://www.grundon.com/PDFs/leaflets/technical/Haz_Landfill_Flyer_Mar_2004.pdf","http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/ians/pdfs/ian127.pdf","http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/ians/pdfs/ian127.pdf","http://www.wrap.org.uk/downloads/W504GateFeesReport_FINAL.dd4675f8.pdf","http://www.ukhr.org/incineration/coventrymap.pdf","http://www.ukhr.org/incineration/coventrymap.pdf","http://epa.gov/ncer/publications/workshop/pdf/EE-0428-01.pdf","http://epa.gov/ncer/publications/workshop/pdf/EE-0428-01.pdf","http://www.recycle.ab.ca/2006Proceedings/PaulConnett_Zero_waste.pdf","http://www.recycle.ab.ca/2006Proceedings/PaulConnett_Zero_waste.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071007232207/http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/main_uk_directives.pdf","http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/main_uk_directives.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071007232207/http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/main_uk_directives.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070927171339/http://www.no-burn.org/resources/library/wiadt.pdf","http://www.no-burn.org/resources/library/wiadt.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070927171339/http://www.no-burn.org/resources/library/wiadt.pdf"],"categories":["Incineration|","Chemical
