{"cursor":"49837","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n at Didcot Power Station (UK)]]\n\n'Cooling towers' are heat removal devices used to transfer process waste heat to\nthe atmosphere. Cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove\nprocess heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or,\nin the case of closed circuit dry cooling towers, rely solely on air to cool the\nworking fluid to near the dry-bulb air temperature.\n\nCommon applications include cooling the circulating water used in oil\nrefineries, petrochemical and other chemical plants, thermal power stations and\nHVAC systems for cooling buildings.\n\nCooling towers vary in size from small roof-top units to very large hyperboloid\nstructures (as in the adjacent image) that can be up to 200 metres tall and 100\nmetres in diameter, or rectangular structures (as in Image 3) that can be over\n40 metres tall and 80 metres long. The hyperboloid cooling towers are often\nassociated with nuclear power plants, although they are also used to some extent\nin some large chemical and other industrial plants. Although these large towers\nare very prominent, the vast majority of cooling towers are much smaller,\nincluding many units installed on or near buildings to discharge heat from air\nconditioning. and open sides rather than a fan; water to be cooled was sprayed\nfrom the top onto the radial pattern of vertical wire-mesh mats.]]\n","linknr":551,"url":"Cooling_towers","recorded":1362511599,"links":72,"instances":["steam_turbine","water"],"pdf":["http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/eic_in_HCF_03.pdf","http://www.cti.org/downloads/WTP-148.pdf","http://www.awt.org/Legionella03.pdf","http://spxcooling.com/pdf/M99-1342.pdf","http://spxcooling.com/pdf/guide12.pdf","http://spxcooling.com/pdf/M92-1474C.pdf","http://www.towertechinc.com/documents/Legionella_Control_White_Paper_05072004.pdf","http://www.gewater.com/pdf/tech73.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/presentations/maulbetsch.pdf","http://204.154.137.14/technologies/coalpower/ewr/pubs/IEP_Power_Plant_Water_R&D_Final_1.pdf","http://www.water.siemens.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Product_Lines/Wallace_and_Tiernan_Products/Brochures/WT.085.272.008.IE.AN.0409.pdf","http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/4/3/pdfs/v4-n3.pdf","http://spxcooling.com/pdf/H-003B.pdf"],"categories":["Cooling
