{"cursor":"101962","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Magnetic Resonance Imaging' ('MRI'), 'nuclear magnetic resonance imaging'\n('NMRI'), or 'magnetic resonance tomography' ('MRT') is a medical imaging\ntechnique used in radiology to visualize internal structures of the body in\ndetail. MRI makes use of the property of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to\nimage nuclei of atoms inside the body.\n\nAn MRI scanner is a device in which the patient lies within a large, powerful\nmagnet where the magnetic field is used to align the magnetization of some\natomic nuclei in the body, and radio frequency magnetic fields are applied to\nsystematically alter the alignment of this magnetization. This causes\nthe nuclei to produce a rotating magnetic field detectable by the scannerâand\nthis information is recorded to construct an image of the scanned area of the\nbody. {{cite book |author=Squire LF, Novelline RA |year=1997\n|edition=5th |title=Squire's fundamentals of radiology |publisher=Harvard\nUniversity Press |isbn=0-674-83339-2 }} Magnetic field gradients cause\nnuclei at different locations to precess at different speeds, which allows\nspatial information to be recovered using Fourier analysis of the measured\nsignal. By using gradients in different directions, 2D images or 3D volumes can\nbe obtained in any arbitrary orientation.\n\nMRI provides good contrast between the different soft tissues of the body, which\nmakes it especially useful in imaging the brain, muscles, the heart, and cancers\ncompared with other medical imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT)\nor X-rays. Unlike CT scans or traditional X-rays, MRI does not use ionizing\nradiation. {{cite web |title=Magnetic\nResonance Imaging |url=http://www.websters-online-\ndictionary.org/definitions/Magnetic
