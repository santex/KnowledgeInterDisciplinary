The classical belt is home to at least three dwarf\nplanets: <!-- Please do not add Eris here.

Originally considered a\nplanet, Pluto's status as part of the Kuiper belt caused it to be reclassified\nas a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006. It is compositionally similar to many other objects\nof the Kuiper belt, and its orbital period is characteristic of a class of KBOs\nknown as \"plutinos\" which share the same 2:3 resonance with Neptune.\n",
