Robots can\nbe autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's\nAdvanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and Tosy's TOSY Ping Pong Playing\nRobot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and\neven microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating\nmovements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.\n\n'Robotics' is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction,\noperation, and application of robots,<ref name=OED></ref> as well as computer\nsystems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These\ntechnologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in\ndangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in\nappearance, behavior, and/or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by\nnature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.\n\n<!-- Basic historical background from mechanical aids to automata --> As\nmechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, more practical\napplications were proposed by Nikola Tesla, who in 1898 designed a radio-\ncontrolled boat. <!-- Electronic development to present day --> Electronics\nevolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first\nelectronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England\nin 1948. The first digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol\nin 1954 and was named the Unimate. It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where\nit was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland\nFisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New\nJersey.<ref>Pearce, Jeremy. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/business/george-devol-developer-of-robot-\narm-dies-at-99.html \"George C. Devol, Inventor of Robot Arm, Dies at 99\"], [[The\nNew York Times]], August 15, 2011. Accessed February 7, 2012. \"In 1961, General\nMotors put the first Unimate arm on an assembly line at the company’s plant in\nEwing Township, N.J., a suburb of Trenton. The device was used to lift and stack\ndie-cast metal parts taken hot from their molds.\"</ref>\n\nRobots have replaced humans<ref></ref> in the assistance of performing those\nrepetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to\ndo due to size limitations, or even those such as in outer space or at the\nbottom of the sea where humans could not survive the extreme environments.\n\n<!-- Social aspects --> There are concerns about the increasing use of robots\nand their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising unemployment as they\nreplace workers in some functions. The use of robots in military combat raises\nethical concerns. The possibility of robot autonomy and potential repercussions\nhas been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.\n","title":"robot","headings":["Overview","History","Etymology","Modern robots","Robots in society","Contemporary uses","Future development","Robots in popular culture","See
