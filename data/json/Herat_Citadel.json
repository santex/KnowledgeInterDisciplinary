{"cursor":"7914","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":") in Herat, Afghanistan.]] The 'Citadel of Herat'(, Pashto Ø³Ú©ÙØ¯Ø±Û Ú©ÙØ§), also\nknown as the 'Citadel of Alexander', and locally known as 'Qala Iktyaruddin'(),\nis located in the center of Herat in Afghanistan. It dates back to 330 BC, when\nAlexander the Great and his army arrived to what is now Afghanistan after the\nBattle of Gaugamela. Many empires have used it as a headquarters in the last\n2,000 years, and was destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries.\n\nThis historic citadel was saved from demolition in the 1950s, and was excavated\nand restored by UNESCO between 1976 and 1979. From\ndecades of wars and neglect, the citadel began to crumble but in recent years\nseveral international organizations decided to completely rebuild it. The\nNational Museum of Herat is also housed inside the citadel, while the Afghan\nMinistry of Information and Culture is the caretaker of the whole premises.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Herat_Citadel","recorded":1362666283,"links":16,"instances":["timurid_dynasty","satrapy","afghanistan"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Herat","Forts"],"headings":["History","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Citadel_in_Herat_in_2011.jpg/300px-Citadel_in_Herat_in_2011.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Herat_1879.png/220px-Herat_1879.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Pathway_inside_the_citadel_of_Alexander_in_Herat.jpg/220px-Pathway_inside_the_citadel_of_Alexander_in_Herat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Inside_the_Museum_of_Herat_in_2011.jpg/300px-Inside_the_Museum_of_Herat_in_2011.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["council_of_ministers","afghanistan"],["aria","satrapy"],["shah_rukh","timurid_dynasty"]],"members":["shah_rukh","aria","council_of_ministers"],"related":["Herat","Afghanistan","Afghan_language","Herat","Afghanistan","Alexander_the_Great","Battle_of_Gaugamela","UNESCO","Council_of_Ministers_(Afghanistan)","Herat","Hari_River,_Afghanistan","Alexander_the_Great","Achaemenid_Empire","Artacoana","Aria_(satrapy)","Seleucid_Empire","Parthian_Empire","Kushan_Empire","Sassanid_Empire","Hephthalite","Umayyad_Caliphate","Tahirid_Dynasty","Saffarid_Dynasty","Samanids","Seljuq_dynasty","Ghaznavids","Ghurid_Dynasty","Silk_Road","India","China","Ghurid_Dynasty","Mongol_Empire","Kartids","Ghiyath_al-Din_Muhammad_bin_Sam","Shah_Rukh_(Timurid_dynasty)","Hotaki_dynasty","Durrani_Empire","First_Anglo-Afghan_War","UNESCO","Aga_Khan_Trust_for_Culture","United_States","Government_of_Germany","United_States_Ambassador_to_Afghanistan","Ryan_Crocker","Nancy_Dupree"]}
