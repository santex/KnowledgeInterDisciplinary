      "text" : "'' roman of 1533]] A '[[knight]]-errant'<ref>as plural, knights-errant is most\ncommon, although the strictly grammatical form knights-errants is also seen,\ne.g. in the article Graal in James O. Halliwell, Dictionary of Archaic and\nProvincial Words (1847).</ref> is a figure of medieval chivalric romance\nliterature. The adjective [[:wikt:errant|errant]] (meaning \"wandering, roving\")\nindicates how the knight-errant would wander the land in search of adventures to\nprove his chivalric virtues, either in knightly duels (pas d'armes) or in some\nother pursuit of courtly love.\n\nThe template of the knight-errant are the heroes of the Round Table of the\nArthurian cycle such as Gawain, Lancelot and Percival. The quest par excellance\nin pursuit of which these knights wander the lands is that of the Holy Grail,\nsuch as in [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]] written by ChrÈtien de Troyes in\nthe 1180s.\n\nAlthough the character is part of the romance genre as it developed during the\nlate 12th century, the term \"knight-errant\" itself is younger, for the first\ntime recorded (as knygt erraunt) in the 14th-century poem [[Sir Gawain and the\nGreen Knight]].<ref>Sir Gawain arrives at the castle of Sir Bercilak de\nHaudesert after long journeys, and Sir Bercilak goes to welcome the \"knygt\nerraunt.\" [http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20010328 The Maven's\nWord of the Day: Knight Errant]</ref> Knight-errantry tales remain popular with\ncourtly audiences throughout the Late Middle Ages. They are written in Middle\nFrench, in Middle English and in Middle German. In the 16th century, the genre\nbecomes highly popular in the Iberian Peninsula, [[Amadis de Gaula]] was one of\nthe most successful knight-errantry tales of this period. In [[Don Quixote]]\n(1605), Cervantes satirizes the Amadis romances and their popularity. Tales of\nknight-errantry then fall out of fashion for two centuries, until they re-emerge\nin the form of the historical novel in Romanticism.\n",
