Washington is located on the banks of\nthe South Fork of The Yuba River and has a population of approximately two\nhundred people. There is a hotel/bar and restaurant, grocery store, a one room\nschoolhouse that has educated students continuously for one hundred years, and\ntwo trailer park campgrounds. The elevation is . The population was 185 at the\n2010 census.\n\nThe population fluctuates seasonally and the town businesses rely on the tourist\ntrade as the population increases in the summer. It was settled during the\nCalifornia Gold Rush in 1849 and produced a large amount of placer gold. Hard\nrock mines were established soon afterword and were very productive. Washington\nis the only settlement in the vicinity to have survived to this day. There\nremains today much evidence of placer gold mining, hydraulic mining, and hard\nrock mining. During the mining period there were a large number of Chinese\nliving there.\n\nWashington's biggest businesses are its two campsites, Gene's Pine Aire\nCampground and the River Rest, which has been in business since the 1960s\nthrough different owners. The summer sees the campsites usually filled to\ncapacity and reservations are generally required.\n\nWashington was also featured in a national phone commercial in the 1990s (\"From\nWashington, D.C., to Washington, California.\").\n\nThe ZIP Code is 95986. The community is inside area code 530.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Washington,_California","recorded":1362565141,"links":24,"instances":["hard_rock","establishment","united_states_census"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Census-designated places in Nevada County, California","Unincorporated communities in California","Populated places established in 1849"],"headings":["History","Geography","Demographics","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/Picture_193.jpg/250px-Picture_193.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/USA_California_location_map.svg/188px-USA_California_location_map.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/6px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Flag_of_California.svg/22px-Flag_of_California.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Map_of_California_highlighting_Nevada_County.svg/87px-Map_of_California_highlighting_Nevada_County.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bar","establishment"],["underground_mining","hard_rock"],["white","u.s._census"],["african_american","u.s._census"],["native_american","u.s._census"],["asian","u.s._census"],["pacific_islander","u.s._census"],["race","united_states_census"],["hispanic","u.s._census"],["latino","u.s._census"],["family","u.s._census"]],"members":["latino","underground_mining","hispanic","bar","white","african_american","pacific_islander","native_american","asian","race","family"],"related":["Census-designated_place","List_of_countries","Political_divisions_of_the_United_States","List_of_counties_in_California","Nevada_County,_California","United_States_Census,_2010","Pacific_Time_Zone","ZIP_code","Area_code_530","Federal_Information_Processing_Standard","Geographic_Names_Information_System","Census-designated_place","Nevada_County,_California","Yuba_River","Hotel","Bar_(establishment)","Restaurant","Grocery","California_Gold_Rush","Gold_mining","Hydraulic_mining","Underground_mining_(hard_rock)","Overseas_Chinese","Area_code_530","Indiana","United_States_Census_Bureau","2010_United_States_Census","Population_density","White_(U.S._Census)","African_American_(U.S._Census)","Native_American_(U.S._Census)","Asian_(U.S._Census)","Pacific_Islander_(U.S._Census)","Race_(United_States_Census)","Hispanic_(U.S._Census)","Latino_(U.S._Census)","Marriage","POSSLQ","Same-sex_partnerships","Family_(U.S._Census)"]}
