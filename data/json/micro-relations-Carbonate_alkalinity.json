Carbonate and bicarbonate anions contribute to alkalinity\ndue to their basic nature, hence their ability to neutralize acid.\nMathematically, the carbonate anion concentration is counted twice due to its\nability to neutralize two protons, while bicarbonate is counted once as it can\nneutralize one proton. Carbonate alkalinity is often the major component of a\nnatural solution's total alkalinity. It is an important factor in understanding\nlarge scale environmental interactions based on simple pH and carbon dioxide\nmeasurements.\n\n \\text{CT (mEq/L)} = [\\text{HCO}_3^-] + 2*[\\text{CO}_3^{2-}]\n\nAlkalinity is commonly expressed as mg/L CaCO 3 because\nCaCO 3 has an equivalent weight of 50.\n\nFor water with a pH below 8.5, the CO 32- will be less than\n1% of the HCO 3- .\n","linknr":106,"url":"Carbonate_alkalinity","recorded":1362568122,"links":16,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acid-base chemistry"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/1/841660847bf01e605233c67b38045d57.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["basic","chemistry"]],"members":["basic"],"related":["Carbonate","Bicarbonate","Anion","Solution","Basic_(chemistry)","Acid","Proton","Alkalinity","PH","Carbon_dioxide","Equivalent_weight","Carbonate","Bicarbonate","Carbonate_hardness"]}
