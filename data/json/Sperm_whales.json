Its name derives from a waxy liquid called\nspermaceti, found in its enormous head. The sperm whale is also known as the\n'cachalot'.\n\nMature males average at in length but can reach , with the head representing up\nto one-third of the animal's length. The sperm whale feeds primarily on giant\nand colossal squid. Plunging to for prey, it is the deepest diving mammal. Its\nclicking vocalization, a form of echolocation and communication, can be as loud\nas 230 decibels underwater, {{cite web\n| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1103_031103_tvspermwhale-\n| .html | accessdate=2011-12-28 title=Sperm Whale \"Voices\" Used to Gauge\n| Whales' Sizes\n}} making it the loudest sound produced by any animal. It has the largest\nbrain of any animal on Earth, more than five times heavier than a human's.\n\nThe sperm whale is cosmopolitan, living across the world's oceans in small\ngroups called pods. Units of females and their young live separately from\nsexually mature males. The females cooperate to protect and nurse their young.\nFemales give birth every four to twenty years, and care for the calves for more\nthan a decade. Living up to 70 years, a mature sperm whale has few natural\npredators. Calves and weakened adults are taken by pods of orcas.\n\nFrom the early 18th century through the late 20th the species was a prime target\nof whalers. The head of the whale contains a liquid wax called spermaceti, which\nwas used in lubricants, oil lamps, and candles. Ambergris, a waste product from\nits digestive system, is still used as a fixative in perfumes. Occasionally the\nsperm whale's great size allowed it to defend itself effectively against\nwhalers. The species is now protected by a whaling moratorium, and is currently\nlisted as vulnerable by the IUCN.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Sperm_whales","recorded":1372152552,"links":[],"instances":["biology","whaleship","fruit","publisher","biology","anatomy","perfumery","whale"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sperm whales","Cetaceans of Australia","Fauna of the Atlantic Ocean","Fauna of the Indian Ocean","Fauna of the Pacific Ocean","Megafauna","Symbols of Connecticut","Monotypic mammal genera","Animals described in 1758","Marine mammals of Hawaii","EDGE species"],"headings":["Etymology","Description","Vocalization complex","Ecology","Life cycle","Social behaviour","Diet","Sleeping","Taxonomy and naming","Evolutionary history","Relationship with humans","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["blowhole","biology"],["prune","fruit"],["melon","whale"],["greenwood_press","publisher"],["order","biology"],["rostrum","anatomy"],["fixative","perfumery"],["essex","whaleship"]],"members":["blowhole","essex","prune","greenwood_press","order","rostrum","fixative","melon"],"related":["Animal","Chordate","Mammal","Cetacea","Odontoceti","Physeteridae","Carl_Linnaeus","10th_edition_of_Systema_Naturae","Desmoulins","Toothed_whale","Species","Sperm_whale_family","Pygmy_sperm_whale","Dwarf_sperm_whale","Spermaceti","Giant_squid","Colossal_squid","Animal_echolocation","Cosmopolitan_distribution","Lactation","Orcas","Whaling","Spermaceti","Ambergris","Vulnerable_species","International_Union_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature_and_Natural_Resources","Apocope","Spermaceti","Semen","Gascon_language","Romance_languages","Basque_language","Encarta","List_of_cetaceans","Baird's_Beaked_Whale","Nantucket_Whaling_Museum","Natural_History_Museum","World_War_II","Sexual_dimorphism","Cetacean","Blowhole_(biology)","Dorsal_fin","Dorsal_fin","Prune_(fruit)","Albino","Toothed_whale","Animal_echolocation","Bottlenose_whale","Elephant_seal","Submarine_communications_cable","Ribcage","Nitrogen","Metabolism","Oxygen","Myoglobin","Blood","Red_blood_cell","Haemoglobin","Buoyancy","Decompression_sickness","Spiny_dogfish","Brain","Largest_body_part","Human_brain","Encephalization_quotient","Dolphin","Anthropoid_ape","Human","Karyotype","Spermaceti","Animal_echolocation","Melon_(whale)","Buoyancy","Specific_density","Herman_Melville","Animal_echolocation","Spermaceti","Cosmopolitan_species","Latitude","Mediterranean_Sea","Black_Sea","Red_Sea","Anoxic_waters","Sulphur","Hydrogen_sulphide","Continental_shelf","Azores","Caribbean","Dominica","R/K_selection_theory","Reproductive_strategy","Gestation","Lactation","Latitude","Scramble_competition","Orca","Orca","Pilot_whale","False_killer_whale","Leucanthemum_vulgare","Greenwood_Press_(publisher)","Giant_squid","Colossal_squid","Octopus","Demersal_zone","Batoidea","Squid","Faecal","Galápagos","Colossal_squid","Humboldt_squid","Cook_Strait","Long-line_fishing","Gulf_of_Alaska","Megamouth_shark","Deep-sea","Ambergris","Pearl","Body_weight","Animal_echolocation","Channel_4","Order_(biology)","Cetacea","Suborder","Odontoceti","Physeteridae","Pygmy_sperm_whale","Dwarf_sperm_whale","Kogiidae","Sperm_whale_family","Carolus_Linnaeus","Clade","Physeteroidea","Pygmy_sperm_whale","Dwarf_sperm_whale","Azerbaijan","Oligocene","Rostrum_(anatomy)","Miocene","Argentina","Miocene","Middle_Miocene","United_States","Europe","Japan","Atlantic_Ocean","Mediterranean_Sea","Peru","Cetacea","Toothed_whale","Physeteroidea","Kogiidae","Pygmy_sperm_whale","Dwarf_sperm_whale","Physeteridae","Ganges_River_dolphin","Platanistoidea","Delphinidae","Phocoenidae","Monodontidae","Ziphiidae","Mysticeti","Mandible","Squid","Italy","Orca","Mysticeti","Odontoceti","Oligocene","Molecular_phylogenetics","Genes","Baleen_whales","Odontoceti","Monophyletic","Comparative_anatomy","Evolutionary_radiation","Physeteroidea","Miocene","Kogiidae","Physeteridae","Spermaceti","Whale_oil","Whaling","Candle","Soap","Cosmetics","Ambergris","Fixative_(perfumery)","Perfumery","Right_whale","New_England","Sloop","Nantucket_Shoals","Davis_Strait","Bowhead_whale","Gulf_Stream","Grand_Banks","Azores","Petroleum","Industrial_Revolution","Nantucket","Essex_(whaleship)","Herman_Melville","Moby-Dick","Walrus","Endangered_Species_Act","CITES","Baleen_whale","World_War_II","Spermaceti","International_Whaling_Commission","Japan","Pacific_Ocean","South_Pacific_Ocean","Long-line_fishing","Gulf_of_Alaska","IUCN","Endangered_Species_Act","Convention_on_Migratory_Species","ACCOBAMS","Pacific_Islands_Cetaceans_Memorandum_of_Understanding","New_Zealand","Māori_people","Māori_people","Fiji","Tabua","Friedrich_Ratzel","Tonga","Scrimshaw","Herman_Melville","Leviathan","Jules_Verne","Connecticut","List_of_U.S._state_mammals","Connecticut_General_Assembly","Whale_watching","Hydrophone","Kaikoura","New_Zealand","South_Island","Andenes","Tromsø","Norway","Azores","Dominica","List_of_cetaceans","Marine_biology"]}
