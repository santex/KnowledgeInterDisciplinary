The term refers to the ability of a material to perform with an\nappropriate host response in a specific situation. \"Biological Performance\nof Materials\", Jonathan Black,2006, ISBN 0-8493-3959-6 The ambiguity of\nthe term reflects the ongoing development of insights into how biomaterials\ninteract with the human body and eventually how those interactions determine the\nclinical success of a medical device (such as pacemaker, hip replacement or\nstent). Modern medical devices and prostheses are often made of more than one\nmaterial so it might not always be sufficient to talk about the biocompatibility\nof a specific material. [http://www.mddionline.com/article/considerations-\nbiocompatibility-evaluation-medical-devices Considerations for the\nBiocompatibility Evaluation of Medical Devices], Kammula and Morris, Medical\nDevice & Diagnostic Industry, May 2001\n\nIndeed, since the immune response and repair functions in the body are so\ncomplicated it is not adequate to describe the biocompatibility of a single\nmaterial in relation to a single cell type or tissue. Sometimes one hears of\nbiocompatibility testing that is a large battery of in vitro test [http://www.emdt.co.uk/article/vitro-biocompatibility-testing-\nbiomaterials-and-medical-devices \"In Vitro Biocompatibility Testing of\nBiomaterials and Medical Devices\"], U. Muller, Medical Device Technology, March\n2008 that is used in accordance with ISO 10993 (or other similar\nstandards) to determine if a certain material (or rather biomedical product) is\nbiocompatible. These tests do not determine the biocompatibility of a material, http://www.mddionline.com/article/biocompatibility-safety-\nassessment-medical-devices-fdaiso-and-japanese-guidelines but they\nconstitute an important step towards the animal testing and finally clinical\ntrials that will determine the biocompatibility of the material in a given\napplication, and thus medical devices such as implants or drug delivery devices.\n\n\nThe word biocompatibility seems have been mentioned for the first time in peer-\nreview journals and meetings in 1970 by RJ Hegyeli (Amer Chem Soc Annual Meeting\nabstract) and CA Homsy et al. ( J Macromol Sci Chem A4:3,615, 1970). It took\nalmost two decades before it began to be commonly used in scientific literature\n(see the graph below).\n\nRecently Williams (again) has been trying to re-evaluate the current knowledge\nstatus regarding what factors determine clinical success. Doing so notes that an\nimplant may not always have to be positively bioactive but it must not do any\nharm (either locally or systematically) (Williams, 2008).\n","linknr":159,"url":"Biocompatibility","recorded":1362506279,"links":21,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biomaterials","Surgery"],"headings":["Five definitions of biocompatibility","Comments on the above five definitions","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Annualpublbiocompatibility19702007.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["implant","medicine"],["implant","medicine"],["implant","medicine"]],"members":["implant"],"related":["Biomaterials","Human_body","Medical_device","Pacemaker","Hip_replacement","Stent","Prostheses","Immune_response","In_vitro","ISO_10993","Animal_testing","Clinical_trial","Medical_device","Implant_(medicine)","Drug_delivery_device","Toxic","ASTM","International_Dictionary_of_Medicine_and_Biology","European_Society_for_Biomaterials","ASTM","Pre-clinical_testing","Implant_(medicine)","Tissue_engineering","Biocompatible_material","Biomaterial","Medical_device","Implant_(medicine)","Medical_grade_silicone"]}
