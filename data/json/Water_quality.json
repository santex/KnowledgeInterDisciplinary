It is most frequently used by reference to a set\n of standards against which compliance can be assessed. The most common\n standards used to assess water quality relate to health of ecosystems, safety\n of human contact and drinking water.\n","linknr":547,"url":"Water_quality","recorded":1362510385,"links":42,"instances":["element","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","electrolytic"],"pdf":["http://floridakeys.noaa.gov/scisummaries/wqfaq.pdf","http://www.who.int/entity/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrconsensusrep.pdf","http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/wet/disk2/atx.pdf","http://www.iowater.net/Publications/BMIKey2Edvmay05.pdf","http://www.dwa.gov.za/iwqs/rhp/methods/dickens%20and%20graham.pdf","http://www.wrc.org.za/downloads/watersa/2006/WISA%20special%20ed/9.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental
