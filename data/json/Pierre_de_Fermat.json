In particular, he is recognized for his discovery of an\noriginal method of finding the greatest and the smallest ordinates of curved\nlines, which is analogous to that of the differential calculus, then unknown,\nand his research into number theory. He made notable contributions to analytic\ngeometry, probability, and optics. He is best known for Fermat's Last Theorem,\nwhich he described in a note at the margin of a copy of Diophantus'\n[[Arithmetica]].\n","linknr":431,"url":"Pierre_de_Fermat","recorded":1362552087,"links":85,"instances":["department"],"pdf":["http://www.ams.org/notices/199507/faltings.pdf"],"categories":["1601 births","1665 deaths","17th-century mathematicians","17th-century French people","Basque mathematicians","French lawyers","French mathematicians","French Roman Catholics","History of calculus","Number theorists","Occitan people","People from Tarn-et-Garonne"],"headings":["Life and work","Assessment of his work","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg/50px-Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Pierre_de_Fermat.jpg/220px-Pierre_de_Fermat.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/France_Toulouse_Capitole_Fermat_072007.jpg/220px-France_Toulouse_Capitole_Fermat_072007.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Pierre_de_Fermat.png/170px-Pierre_de_Fermat.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Fermat_burial_plaque.jpg/220px-Fermat_burial_plaque.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Fermats_will.jpg/170px-Fermats_will.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tarn","department"]],"members":["tarn"],"related":["François_Viète","Beaumont-de-Lomagne","Kingdom_of_France","Castres","Kingdom_of_France","France","French_people","Mathematics","Law","Number_theory","Analytic_geometry","Fermat's_principle","Probability","Fermat's_Last_Theorem","Adequality","French_people","Toulouse","France","List_of_amateur_mathematicians","Infinitesimal_calculus","Adequality","Ordinate","Differential_calculus","Number_theory","Analytic_geometry","Probability","Optics","Fermat's_Last_Theorem","Diophantus","Beaumont-de-Lomagne","Tarn-et-Garonne","Collège_de_Navarre","University_of_Orléans","Bordeaux","Apollonius_of_Perga","Jean_de_Beaugrand","Maxima_and_minima","François_Viète","Parlement_de_Toulouse","René_Descartes","John_Wallis","Blaise_Pascal","Anders_Hald","New_algebra","Jan_Gullberg","Adequality","Numerical_integration","Geometric_series","Isaac_Newton","Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz","Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus","Pell's_equation","Perfect_number","Amicable_number","Fermat_numbers","Fermat's_little_theorem","Fermat's_factorization_method","Infinite_descent","Fermat's_theorem_on_sums_of_two_squares","Fermat_polygonal_number_theorem","Triangular_number","Lagrange's_four-square_theorem","Pentagonal_number","Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","Fermat's_Last_Theorem","Marin_Mersenne","Wiles's_proof_of_Fermat's_Last_Theorem","Diophantine_equation","Empty_set","Problem_of_points","Probability_theory","Gambler","Dice","Principle_of_least_time","Snell's_law","History_of_variational_principles_in_physics","Hero_of_Alexandria","Principle_of_least_action","Fermat's_principle","Castres","Tarn_(department)","Toulouse","Théophile_Barrau","Haute-Garonne","Toulouse","René_Descartes","Isaac_Newton","André_Weil","Algebraic_curve","Elliptic_curve","Infinite_descent","Group_theory","Rational_point","Diagonal_form","Euler's_theorem","List_of_things_named_after_Pierre_de_Fermat","Rouse_History_of_Mathematics","Beaumont-de-Lomagne","France","Castres","France"]}
