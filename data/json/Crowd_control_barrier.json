{"cursor":"6090","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Crowd control barriers' (also referred to as 'crowd control barricades,' with\nsome versions called a 'French barrier' or 'bike rack' in the USA), are commonly\nused at many public events. They are frequently visible at sporting events,\nparades, political rallies, demonstrations, and outdoor festivals. Event\norganizers, venue managers, and security personnel use barricades as part of\ntheir crowd management planning.\n\nCrowd control barriers act as a physical and psychological barrier, used to\ndemarcate \"no access\" zones, and to designate space for lines. They are also\nused by riot police to control large gatherings.\n\nCrowd control barricades are most commonly made of steel, although lighter-\nweight plastic variations are sometimes used. Barriers are most effective when\nthey interlock, being attached to each other in a line via hooks at the side of\neach barricade. When barricades are interlocked, security personnel can create\nimpenetrable lines, because such lines of barriers will not likely be able to be\ntoppled over.\n","linknr":124,"url":"Crowd_control_barrier","recorded":1362890097,"links":17,"instances":["barrier","photographer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crowd control and riot control techniques","Perimeter security"],"headings":["History","Characteristics","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Kodachrome-Balelec-04.jpg/280px-Kodachrome-Balelec-04.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nadar","photographer"],["chicane","barrier"]],"members":["chicane","nadar"],"related":["Nadar_(photographer)","Brussels","Sawhorse","John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport","The_Beatles","Mojo_Barrier","Galvanization","Rust","Chicane_(barrier)","Crowd_control","J-J_Hooks_barrier_connection_system","Temporary_fencing","Vinyl_fence","Privacy_fencing","Crowd_manipulation","2009_Birmingham_Millennium_Point_stampede"]}
