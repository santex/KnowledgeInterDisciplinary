      "text" : "\n\n\n'Military science' is the theory, method, and practice of producing military\ncapability in a manner consistent with national defense policy. Military science\nserves to identify the strategic, political, economic, psychological, social,\noperational, technological, and tactical elements necessary to sustain relative\nadvantage of military force; and to increase the likelihood and favorable\noutcomes of victory in peace or during a war. Military scientists include\ntheorists, researchers, experimental scientists, applied scientists, designers,\nengineers, test technicians, and other military personnel.\n\nMilitary personnel obtain weapons, equipment and training to achieve specific\nstrategic goals. Military science is also used to establish enemy capability as\npart of technical intelligence.\n\nIn military history, military science had been used during the period of\nIndustrial Revolution as a general term to refer to all matters of military\ntheory and technology application as a single academic discipline, including\nthat of the deployment and employment of troops in peacetime or in battle.\n\nIn military education, military science is often the name of the department in\nthe education institution that administers officer candidate education. However,\nthis education usually focuses on the officer leadership training and basic\ninformation about employment of military theories, concepts, methods and\nsystems, and graduates are not military scientists on completion of studies, but\nrather junior military officers.\n",
