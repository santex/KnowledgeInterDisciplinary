It was founded in 1947 by families who worked for or\nwere associated with the United Nations. The school was founded to provide an\ninternational education, while preserving its students' diverse cultural\nheritages. It includes a Kindergarten, elementary school (Junior school), junior\nhigh school (Middle school) and high school (Tutorial House, or Tut House). As\nof 2008, it has over 1,450 students representing 150 countries. English is the\nmain language of instruction. Secondary studies aim towards the International\nBaccalaureate.\n\nThe school has two campuses, one in Manhattan, on the East River adjacent to\nWaterside Plaza (approximately one mile south of the United Nations\nHeadquarters), and one in the borough of Queens, in Jamaica Estates.\n\nEvery year, students from UNIS organize and run the UNIS-UN Conference, held in\nthe General Assembly Hall of the United Nations Headquarters.\n","linknr":214,"url":"United_Nations_International_School","recorded":1374964427,"links":["/w/index.php?title=United_Nations_International_School&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=United_Nations_International_School&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Hanoi","/wiki/United_Nations_International_School_of_Hanoi","/wiki/Taxonomy_of_schools","/wiki/Independent_school","/wiki/International_School","/wiki/Private_School","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Campus","/wiki/Urban_area","/wiki/School_colors","/wiki/Student_newspaper","http://www.unis.org","/wiki/International_school","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/United_Nations","/wiki/International_Baccalaureate","/wiki/Manhattan","/wiki/East_River","/wiki/Waterside_Plaza","/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters","/wiki/Queens","/wiki/Jamaica_Estates,_Queens","/wiki/UNIS-UN","#Curriculum","#Notable_alumni","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=United_Nations_International_School&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/File:UNIS_United_Nations_International_School.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/UNIS_United_Nations_International_School.jpg/375px-UNIS_United_Nations_International_School.jpg","/wiki/File:UNIS_United_Nations_International_School.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/McGill_University","/wiki/George_Washington_University","/wiki/Cornell_University","/wiki/Boston_University","/wiki/New_York_University","/wiki/University_of_Virginia","/wiki/Brown_University","/wiki/Duke_University","/wiki/Barnard_College","/wiki/Columbia_University","/w/index.php?title=United_Nations_International_School&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Ishmael_Beah","#cite_note-PersonalWebsite-4","/wiki/Byrdie_Bell","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Yasmine_Bleeth","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Kate_Burton_(actress)","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Vikram_Chatwal","/wiki/Sant_Singh_Chatwal","#cite_note-nym-8","/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery","/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dujarric_de_la_Rivi%C3%A8re","#cite_note-9","/wiki/Nicholas_Guest","/wiki/Stephen_Hartke","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Sarah_Jones_(stage_actress)","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Sarah_Kay_(poet)","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Radhika_Coomaraswamy","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Rashid_Khalidi","/wiki/Columbia_University","#cite_note-SantoraGootman-14","/wiki/Joakim_Noah","/wiki/Chicago_Bulls","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Atsushi_Ogata","#cite_note-16","/wiki/Amanda_Plummer","/wiki/Qubilah_Shabazz","/wiki/Malcolm_X","#cite_note-LindaYglesias-17","/wiki/S._K._Thoth","#cite_note-18","/wiki/Marius_Vassiliou","/wiki/John_Zorn","#cite_note-19","/w/index.php?title=United_Nations_International_School&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.unis.org/about_unis/faq.aspx","#cite_ref-2","http://www.unis.org/admissions/admissions_procedures__guidelines/index.aspx","#cite_ref-3","http://www.unis.org/academic_programs/high_school/college_counseling/index.aspx","#cite_ref-PersonalWebsite_4-0","http://www.alongwaygone.com/ishmael_beah.html/","#cite_ref-5","http://byrdiebell.com/","#cite_ref-6","http://www.filmbug.com/db/705","#cite_ref-7","http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/theater/01burt.html","#cite_ref-nym_8-0","http://nymag.com/relationships/features/16368/","#cite_ref-9","http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=14675","#cite_ref-10","http://uprserver4.usc.edu/trojan_family/winter04/F3-Hartke.html","#cite_ref-11","http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/nyregion/sarah-jones-playwright-scouting-the-city-for-her-characters.html?pagewanted=all","#cite_ref-12","http://www.kaysarahsera.com/about-1/","#cite_ref-13","http://www.huffingtonpost.com/radhika-coomaraswamy","#cite_ref-SantoraGootman_14-0","http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/nyregion/31khalil.html?partner=permalink&exprod=permalink","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","#cite_ref-15","http://www.allsportspeople.com/basketball/people/Joakim_Noah","#cite_ref-16","http://www.unis.org/alumni/alumni_reunions/index.aspx","#cite_ref-LindaYglesias_17-0","http://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-06-08/news/18029503_1_malcolm-shabazz-qubilah-shabazz-percy-sutton/3
