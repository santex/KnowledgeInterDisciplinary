It begins\nwith the regulated triggering of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Metaphase\nends with the destruction of B cyclin. B cyclin is marked with ubiquitin which\nflags it for destruction by proteasomes, which is required for the function of\nmetaphase cyclin-dependent kinases (M-Cdks). Anaphase starts when the anaphase\npromoting complex marks an inhibitory chaperone called securin with ubiquitin\nfor destruction. Securin is a protein which inhibits a protease known as\nseparase. Once destroyed, separase is unleashed and breaks down cohesin, a\nprotein responsible for holding sister chromatids together. The centromeres are split, and the new daughter\nchromosomes are pulled toward the poles. They take on a V-shape as they are\npulled back.\n\nWhile the chromosomes are drawn to each side of the cell, the non-kineticore\nspindle fibers push against each other, in a ratcheting action, that stretches\nthe cell into an oval.\n\nOnce anaphase is complete, the cell moves into telophase.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Anaphase","recorded":1362484441,"links":27,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mitosis"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Anaphase.svg/300px-Anaphase.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Anaphase_IF.jpg/300px-Anaphase_IF.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["staining","biology"]],"members":["staining"],"related":["Newt","Staining_(biology)","Fluorescent","Dye","Ancient_Greek","Mitosis","Meiosis","Chromosome","Cell_cycle","Metaphase","Cyclin","Ubiquitin","Proteasomes","Anaphase_promoting_complex","Inhibitory_chaperone","Securin","Protease","Separase","Cohesin","Telophase","Cdc20"]}
