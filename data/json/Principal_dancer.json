{"cursor":"1513","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet in London.]]\n\nA 'principal dancer' (often shortened to 'principal') is a dancer at the highest\nrank within a professional dance company, particularly a ballet\ncompany.\n\nA principal may be male or female. The position is similar to that of [[Soloist\n(ballet)|soloist]]; however, principals are hired by (or promoted from within) a\ncompany to regularly perform not only solos, but also pas de deux. It is a\ncoveted position in the company and the most prominent position a dancer can\nreceive. The term is used mostly in ballet but can be used in other forms as\nwell, such as modern dance. The terms [[prima ballerina]], [[premier danseur]],\nand [[premiÃ¨re danseuse]] have been used to denote similar levels of prominence.\nThey are usually the star of the ballet.\n\nThe term 'senior principal dancer' is sometimes used as well.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Principal_dancer","recorded":1362670655,"links":22,"instances":["dance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ballet occupations"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Sarah_Lamb_Fin_du_jour.jpg/220px-Sarah_Lamb_Fin_du_jour.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Tamara_Toumanova_%26_Serge_Lifar.jpg/80px-Tamara_Toumanova_%26_Serge_Lifar.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Ballerina-icon.jpg/30px-Ballerina-icon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["solo","dance"]],"members":["solo"],"related":["Royal_Ballet","Dancer","Dance_company","Ballet_company","Solo_(dance)","Pas_de_deux","Modern_dance"]}
