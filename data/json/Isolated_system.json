Truly isolated systems cannot exist in nature, other than\npossibly the universe itself, and they are thus hypothetical concepts\nonly. Thermodynamics of Spontaneous and Non-Spontaneous Processes; I.

The only truly isolated system is the universe as a whole\nbecause, for example, there is always gravity between a system with mass, and\nmasses elsewhere. Real systems may behave nearly as an isolated system for\nfinite (possibly very long) times.\n\nThe concept of an isolated system can serve as a useful model approximating many\nreal-world situations. It is an acceptable idealization used in constructing\nmathematical models of certain natural phenomena; e.g., the Sun and planets in\nour solar system, and the proton and electron in a hydrogen atom are often\ntreated as isolated systems. But from time to time, a hydrogen atom will\ninteract with electromagnetic radiation and go to an excited state.\n\nIn the attempt to justify the postulate of entropy increase in the second law of\nthermodynamics, Boltzmannâs H-theorem used equations which assumed a system (for\nexample, a gas) was isolated. That is all the mechanical could be specified,\ntreating the walls simply as mirror boundary conditions. This inevitably led to\nLoschmidt's paradox. However, if the stochastic behavior of the molecules in\nactual walls is considered, along with the randomizing effect of the ambient,\nbackground thermal radiation, Boltzmannâs assumption of molecular chaos can be\njustified.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Isolated_system","recorded":1362480432,"links":31,"instances":["systems_theory","optics"],"pdf":["http://www.icpress.co.uk/etextbook/p631/p631_chap01.pdf"],"categories":["Thermodynamics","Physical systems"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["open_system","systems_theory"],["absorption","optics"],["open_system","systems_theory"]],"members":["open_system","absorption"],"related":["Natural_sciences","Physical_system","Conservation_law","Closed_system","Open_system_(systems_theory)","Scientific_modeling","Idealization","Mathematical_model","Phenomenon","Sun","Planet","Solar_system","Proton","Electron","Hydrogen_atom","Absorption_(optics)","Electromagnetic_radiation","Excited_state","Entropy","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","H-theorem","Gas","Mirror","Boundary_condition","Loschmidt's_paradox","Stochastic","Molecule","Random","Thermal_radiation","Molecular_chaos","Closed_system","Dynamical_system","Open_system_(systems_theory)","Thermodynamic_system"]}
