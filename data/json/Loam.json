{"cursor":"3219","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Loam' is soil composed of sand, silt, and clay in relatively even concentration\n(about 40-40-20% concentration respectively). }} These proportions can vary to a degree however, and result in\ndifferent types of loam soils: sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam, sandy clay\nloam, silty clay loam, and loam. Loam soils\ngenerally contain more nutrients, moisture and humus than sandy soils, have\nbetter drainage and infiltration of water and air than silty soils, and are\neasier to till than clay soils. The different types of loam soils each have\nslightly different characteristics, with some draining liquids more efficiently\nthan others.\n\nLoam is considered ideal for gardening and agricultural uses because it retains\nnutrients well and retains water while still allowing excess water to drain\naway. B. Rosie Lerner, \"[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/loam.html What is\nLoam?]\", Purdue University Consumer Horticulture, 6 January 2000. Retrieved 17\nDecember 2012. A soil dominated by one or two of the three particle size\ngroups can behave like loam if it has a strong granular structure, promoted by a\nhigh content of organic matter. However, a soil that meets the textural\ndefinition of loam can lose its characteristic desirable qualities when it is\ncompacted, depleted of organic matter, or has clay dispersed throughout its fine-\nearth fraction.\n\nLoam is found in a majority of successful farms in regions around the world\nknown for their fertile land. Loam soil feels soft and crumbly and is easy to\nwork over a wide range of moisture conditions.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Loam","recorded":1362575883,"links":32,"instances":["grain_size"],"pdf":["http://www.tbe-euro.com/downloads/SustainableBuildingConference-Austria1.pdf"],"categories":["Types of soil"],"headings":["Use in house construction","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Lehmgrube.jpg/220px-Lehmgrube.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["particle_size","grain_size"]],"members":["particle_size"],"related":["Soil","Sand","Silt","Clay","Humus","Tillage","Purdue_University","Rammed_earth","Adobe","Particle_size_(grain_size)","Loess"]}
