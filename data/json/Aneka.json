She was well known for the Oriental image she adopted for the song. After\nher brief foray into pop she reverted to her real name and established herself\nas an accomplished singer of Scottish traditional music.\n\nMary Sandeman recorded the song \"Japanese Boy\" in 1981. Impressed with the\nresults, her record company, Hansa decided to release it as a single with full\npromotion. Arriving at the name 'Aneka' in a telephone directory, Sandeman\nfashioned a suitable image for the song. Released in summer 1981, \"Japanese\nBoy\" made an impressive leap in the charts and reached No.1 for one week in\nAugust. [http://www.wwwk.co.uk/music/hit-singles/years/1981.htm No. 1 UK\nHit Singles of 1981 ]\n\nBuoyed by this level of success, the record company commissioned an album and\nlooked to find a follow-up single. The song \"Little Lady\" was chosen, but caused\nsome concern as to what her image would be now, as it was felt that a Japanese\nlook would be inappropriate for the song as well as giving the artist a limited\nlifespan. In the event, Sandeman adopted a 19th Century lady image, but retained\nthe same high-pitched voice as used for her hit. The song failed to chart highly\nin the UK, reaching only No.50 - securing her the label of 'one-hit\nwonder'. [http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=9655 Chart Stats - Aneka\n- Little Lady ]\n\nSandeman's debut album \"Aneka\" was released at the same time and featured a mix\nof upbeat pop tracks in the vein of \"Japanese Boy\" and a selection of slow-paced\nnumbers, sung in her 'true' singing voice. The album however failed to chart.\n\nA third and final single was released in early 1982. This was \"Ooh Shooby Doo\nDoo Lang\", which told a light-hearted tale of a singer bemoaning the fact that\nshe is relegated to backing vocals, but goes on to mention Paul McCartney and\nStevie Wonder as well referencing both \"Japanese Boy\" and \"Little Lady\". The\nsong missed the UK Chart and this effectively saw the end of Aneka. In Europe\nhowever, it gave her a third hit and was followed there by the release of\nanother album track, \"I Was Free\".

Sandeman then dropped the Aneka title and continued with the\nfolk-singing career she had begun before her fame.\n\nAneka has had a modest revival in recent years, when \"Japanese Boy\" was featured\nin the videogame [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] on Flash\nFM. [http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/561545/21198 GameFAQs: Grand\nTheft Auto: Vice City (PS2) Flash FM Script by ElementX ]\n\nSandeman featured in a 2006 Channel 4 documentary titled [[Bring Back...|'Bring\nBack The One Hit Wonders']]. Justin Lee Collins attempted to organise a one-off\nperformance of as many 'one hit wonders' as possible but despite getting in\ntouch with Sandeman, she declined to take part as she did not want to travel to\nLondon from her home in Scotland, and had 'no desire' to perform the hit that\nmade her place in pop history. She revealed though that \"Japanese Boy\" sold five\nmillion copies around the world.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Aneka","recorded":1375079478,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Pop_music","/wiki/Singer","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Hansa_Records","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English#Key","/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English","/wiki/Singer","/wiki/Record_chart","/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart","/wiki/Japanese_Boy","/wiki/Hansa_Records","#cite_note-1","/wiki/One-hit_wonder","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Paul_McCartney","/wiki/Stevie_Wonder","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City","/wiki/Flash_FM","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Channel_4","/wiki/Bring_Back...","/wiki/Justin_Lee_Collins","#Mary_Sandeman","#Singles","#Album","#References","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Mezzo_soprano","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/STV_(TV_network)","/wiki/Hogmanay","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart","#cite_note-British_Hit_Singles_.26_Albums-8","/wiki/Kent_Report","/wiki/Austria","/wiki/Japanese_Boy","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Switzerland","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.wwwk.co.uk/music/hit-singles/years/1981.htm","#cite_ref-2","http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=9655","#cite_ref-3","http://uktop40.republika.pl/art%20na%20top%2040/art-a-aneka.html","#cite_ref-4","http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/aneka","#cite_ref-5","http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/561545/21198","#cite_ref-6","http://www.relrecords.com/487%20001%20Northern%20Lights.htm","#cite_ref-7","http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/506746","#cite_ref-British_Hit_Singles_.26_Albums_8-0","/wiki/British_Hit_Singles_%26_Albums","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-904994-10-5","#cite_ref-9","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aneka&oldid=564500548","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1954_births","/wiki/Category:British_dance_musicians","/wiki/Category:British_female_singers","/wiki/Category:British_folk_singers","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Scottish_female_singers","/wiki/Category:Scottish_folk_singers","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_April_2010","/wiki/Category:Place_of_birth_missing_(living_people)","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Aneka&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Aneka","/wiki/Aneka","/wiki/Talk:Aneka","#","/wiki/Aneka","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Aneka","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Aneka","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&oldid=564500548","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q242568","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Aneka&id=564500548","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Aneka","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Aneka&oldid=564500548&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Aneka&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneka","//da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anek
