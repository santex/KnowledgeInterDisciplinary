This is most commonly\ndue to occlusion (blockage) of a coronary artery following the rupture of a\nvulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which is an unstable collection of lipids\n(cholesterol and fatty acids) and white blood cells (especially macrophages) in\nthe wall of an artery. The resulting ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and\nensuing oxygen shortage, if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can\ncause damage or death ([[infarction]]) of heart muscle tissue ([[myocardium]]).\n\nTypical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction include sudden retrosternal\nchest pain (typically radiating to the left arm or left side of the neck),\nshortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, sweating, and anxiety\n(often described as a sense of impending doom). Women may experience fewer typical symptoms than men, most commonly\nshortness of breath, weakness, a feeling of indigestion, and fatigue. A sizeable proportion of myocardial\ninfarctions (22â64%) are \"silent\", that is\nwithout chest pain or other symptoms.\n\nAmong the diagnostic tests available to detect heart muscle damage are an\nelectrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, cardiac MRI and various blood tests.\nThe most often used blood markers are the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) fraction\nand the troponin levels. Immediate treatment for suspected acute myocardial\ninfarction includes oxygen, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin.\n\nMost cases of myocardial infarction with ST elevation on ECG (STEMI) are treated\nwith reperfusion therapy, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or\nthrombolysis. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) may be\nmanaged with medication, although PCI may be required if the patient's risk\nwarrants it. People who have multiple blockages of\ntheir coronary arteries, particularly if they also have diabetes mellitus, may\nbenefit from bypass surgery (CABG). The European Society of Cardiology guidelines in 2011 proposed\ntreating the blockage causing the myocardial infarction by PCI and performing\nCABG later when the patient is more stable. Rarely CABG\nmay be preferred in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, for example when\nPCI has failed or is contraindicated.\n\nIschemic heart disease (which includes myocardial infarction, angina pectoris\nand heart failure when preceded by myocardial infarction) was the leading cause\nof death for both men and women worldwide in 2004.\nImportant risk factors are previous cardiovascular disease, older age, tobacco\nsmoking, high blood levels of certain lipids (low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol, triglycerides) and low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)\ncholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, lack of physical activity and\nobesity, chronic kidney disease, excessive alcohol consumption, the abuse of\nillicit drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines), and chronic high stress\nlevels.\n","linknr":1556,"url":"Myocardial_infarction","recorded":1362482094,"links":114,"instances":["psychology","medicine","medical","medicine","medicine","medicine","pharmacology","physical","medical","anatomy","99mtc_sestamibi"],"pdf":["http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/70/3/222/_pdf","http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/circj/70/3/222/_pdf","http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf/39VolNo3Mar2010/V39N3p210.pdf","http://www.annals.edu.sg/pdf/39VolNo3Mar2010/V39N3p210.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/97/18/1837.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/97/18/1837.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/107/3/499.pdf","http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/107/3/499.pdf","http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/97/12/3790.pdf","http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/97/12/3790.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Nuc_Cardio.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Nuc_Cardio.pdf"],"categories":["Aging-associated
