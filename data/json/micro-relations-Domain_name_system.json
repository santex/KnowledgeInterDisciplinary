{"cursor":"44096","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Domain Name System' ('DNS') is a hierarchical distributed naming system for\ncomputers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private\nnetwork. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of\nthe participating entities. Most prominently, it translates domain names\nmeaningful for users to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of\nlocating computer services and devices worldwide. By providing a worldwide,\ndistributed keyword-based redirection service, the Domain Name System is an\nessential component of the functionality of the Internet.\n\nAn often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the\nphone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer hostnames\ninto IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to\nthe addresses 192.0.43.10 (IPv4) and 2001:500:88:200::10 (IPv6). Unlike a phone\nbook, the DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the\nnetwork to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same\nhost name. Users take advantage of this when they recite meaningful Uniform\nResource Locators (URLs) and e-mail addresses without having to know how the\ncomputer actually locates the services.\n\nThe Domain Name System distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names\nand mapping those names to IP addresses by designating authoritative name\nservers for each domain. Authoritative name servers are assigned to be\nresponsible for their particular domains, and in turn can assign other\nauthoritative name servers for their sub-domains. This mechanism has made the\nDNS distributed and fault tolerant and has helped avoid the need for a single\ncentral register to be continually consulted and updated. Additionally, the\nresponsibility for maintaining and updating the master record for the domains is\nspread among many domain name registrars, who compete for the end-user's, domain-\nowner's, business. Domains can be moved from registrar to registrar at any time.\n\nThe Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of this\ndatabase service. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the\ndata structures and data communication exchanges used in DNS, as part of the\nInternet Protocol Suite.\n\nThe Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy RFC 1034, Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities, P. Mockapetris,\nThe Internet Society (November 1987) and the Internet Protocol (IP)\naddress spaces. RFC 781, Internet Protocol - DARPA Internet\nProgram Protocol Specification, Information Sciences Institute, J. Postel (Ed.),\nThe Internet Society (September 1981) The Domain Name System maintains the\ndomain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the\naddress spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the\nDomain Name System. RFC 1035, Domain Names - Implementation and\nSpecification, P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987) A DNS\nname server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain name, such as\naddress (A or AAAA) records, name server (NS) records, and mail exchanger (MX)\nrecords (see also list of DNS record types); a DNS name server responds with\nanswers to queries against its database.\n","linknr":684,"url":"Domain_name_system","recorded":1362668986,"links":85,"instances":["computing","name_service","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Domain name system|","Application layer protocols","Internet protocols"],"headings":["History","Structure {{anchor|The domain name space}}","Operation","Protocol details","DNS resource records","Protocol extensions","Dynamic zone updates","Security issues","Domain name registration","Internet standards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Domain_name_space.svg/400px-Domain_name_space.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/An_example_of_theoretical_DNS_recursion.svg/400px-An_example_of_theoretical_DNS_recursion.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/DNS_in_the_real_world.svg/400px-DNS_in_the_real_world.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Internet_map_1024.jpg/28px-Internet_map_1024.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["load_balancing","computing"],["hotspot","wi-fi"],["octet","computing"],["hesiod","name_service"]],"members":["octet","hesiod","hotspot","load_balancing"],"related":["Hierarchical","Internet","Private_network","Domain_name","Domain_name","IP_address","Index_term","Internet","Telephone_directory","Hostname","Example.com","IPv4","IPv6","Uniform_Resource_Locator","E-mail_address","Authoritative_name_server","Domain_name_registrar","Internet_Protocol_Suite","Namespace","Internet_Protocol","Address_space","Network_protocol","List_of_DNS_record_types","ARPANET","SRI_International","O'Reilly_Media","Hosts_file","Jon_Postel","Paul_Mockapetris","Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","Request_for_Comments","University_of_California,_Berkeley","Unix","BIND","Digital_Equipment_Corporation","Paul_Vixie","Porting","Windows_NT","Comparison_of_DNS_server_software","Tree_data_structure","DNS_root_zone","DNS_zone","Domain_name","Top-level_domain","Subdomain","Domain_name_registry","ASCII","Hostname","ICANN","Internationalized_domain_name","Unicode","Punycode","Domain_name_registry","Top-level_domain","Distributed_database","Client-server","Root_nameserver","Domain_name_registrar","Domain_registry","Top_level_domain","Fully_qualified_domain_name","IP_address","Domain_Information_Groper","Root_nameserver","DNS_root_zone","Internet_service_providers","Circular_dependency","Authoritative_name_server","Top_level_domain","Time_to_live","Negative_cache",".arpa","Web_browser","E-mail_client","DNS_resolver","Internet_service_provider","Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol","Slashdot","Internet_Explorer","Microsoft_Corporation","Virtual_hosting","Fault-tolerance","Load_balancing_(computing)","Mail_transfer_agent","E-mail","MX_record","Sender_Policy_Framework","DomainKeys","Root_nameserver","Anycast","Dynamic_DNS","Internet_Service_Provider","Hotspot_(Wi-Fi)","User_Datagram_Protocol","Port_number","Transmission_Control_Protocol","DNS_zone_transfer","Round-robin_DNS","Global_Server_Load_Balancing","DNSSEC","Octet_(computing)","Time_to_live","Fully_qualified_domain_name","IPv4_address","Name_server","DNS_zone","E-mail_address","List_of_DNS_record_types","Chaosnet","Hesiod_(name_service)","DNS_zone","Zone_file","EDNS","Extension_mechanisms_for_DNS","Dynamic_DNS","DHCP","DNS_cache_poisoning","Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions","Typeface","Internationalized_domain_name","ISO_10646","Phishing","Forward-confirmed_reverse_DNS","Domain_name_registrar","Internet_Corporation_for_Assigned_Names_and_Numbers","Whois","ICANN","WHOIS","Country_code_top-level_domain","DENIC","GTLD","WHOIS","VeriSign","WHOIS","Name_server","Request_for_Comments","Internet_Engineering_Task_Force","Internet_standard","Alternative_DNS_root","Comparison_of_DNS_server_software","DNS_cache_poisoning","DNS_hijacking","DNS_management_software","Dynamic_DNS","Internet_Provider_Security","IPv6_brokenness_and_DNS_whitelisting","List_of_DNS_record_types","Microsoft_DNS","Round_robin_DNS","Split-horizon_DNS","ACM_Queue"]}
