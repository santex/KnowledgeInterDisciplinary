White Memorial Medical\nCenter (WMMC) is owned and operated by Adventist Health, staffed by 1,879\nemployees, nearly 700 volunteers, 462 physicians, and 86 residents. The Seventh-\nday Adventist medical center has maintained its mission of keeping the community\nhealthy since 1913, serving more than 126,000 patients each year.\n\n\nOn September 29, 1913, the small storefront medical clinic in the Los Angeles\nneighborhood of Boyle Heights, opened its doors for the first time with the aid\nof the clinic's director, Dr. August Larsen. The second-hand medical instrument\nequipped clinic provided treatment at no cost and served as a training ground\nfor physicians attending the College of Medical Evangelistsânow Loma Linda\nUniversity. It was until 1915, when the talented Dr. Percy Magan serves as the\nnew director of medical education at the clinic, leaving a prestigious teaching\npost and practice. A contibution of $30,000 from philanthropist Josie Phillips\nallows the hospital to nearly double its capacity expanding from 59 beds to 94\nbeds in 1922.\n\nIn 1937, the new WMMC building opensâthe first fireproof hospital in the state.\nThe designer is noted architect Myron Hunt, who also designed the Rose Bowl. The\n1950s decade brought many expansions to WMMC, including a new wing that doubled\nthe bed capacity of the hospital and included a radiation laboratory, electro-\nencephalobraphy unit, psychiatric ward and complete emergency facilities. It was\nduring this decade that the new White Memorial Church was completed adjacent to\nthe hospital. The opening of a $4.2 million Diagnostic an Treatment Center, now\ncalled the North Tower, became the highlight of the year 1968. In 2010, a $250\nmillion project to rebuild White Memorial became completeâmade possible in part\nby $89 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding for seismic\nupgrades and $30 million in community support.\n\n\nToday, White Memorial is one of the region's leading not-for-profit hospitals.\nMedical services include behavioral medicine, cardiac and vascular care,\nintensive and general medical care, oncology, orthopedic care, rehabilitation,\nspecialized and general surgery, and womenâs and childrenâs services. As a major\nteaching hospital, White Memorial also plays an important role in training\nphysicians, nurses and other medical professionals. In 2012, White Memorial\ncelebrated its 100-year journey of faith and healing. No easy path to be sure,\nas the hospital has been rocked by earthquakes, hit by economic crisis weathered\ntwo world wars and seen seismic shifts in the population it serves.\n\n\nOn April 18, 1982, the new hospital opens in a cluster of single-story buildings\nas an earthquake rocks the opening ceremony. In 1930, the Great Depression hits\nand WMMC physicians accept payment from patients in flour, sugar or household\ngoods. During this time, medical students provided janitorial work for free and\nnurses made home visits at no compensation. In the 1980s, White Memorial hit\nrock bottom, financially. Nationwide, the cost of delivering care was spiraling\nupward and many patients lacked health insurance or the ability to pay. The\nmedical center was forced to eliminate programs and made difficult decisions\nabout reducing staff. After years of belt-tightening, the hospital's future\nfinlly looked brighter. Despite the hardships, White Memorial has survived and\nflourished.\n\nIn 2011, U.S. News and World Report named the hospital one of the top 25 best\nhospitals in the Los Angeles metro area. In the same year, White Memorial\nMedical Center won five 5-star awards from Professional Research Consultants,\nInc. (PRC) for exceeding overall quality of care. In 2012, U.S. News and World\nReport ranked White Memorial as a first-class facility in both the city of Los\nAngeles and the state of Californiaâ #12 of the 32 top rated hospitals in the\nLos Angeles metropolitan area and #20 of the 41 strong-performing hospitals in\nCalifornia. The Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes (CALNOC) has also\nrecognized WMMC as a top hospital for nursing quality and success in reducing\nboth hospital-acquired pressure ulcers and patient falls. HealthGrades awarded\nthe hospital with 14 designations for being a \"National & State Leader in\nClinical Excellence.\"\n","linknr":101,"url":"White_Memorial_Medical_Center","recorded":1375084866,"links":["/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Adventist_Health","/wiki/File:White_Memorial_Medical_Center_logo.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/13/White_Memorial_Medical_Center_logo.JPG/220px-White_Memorial_Medical_Center_logo.JPG","/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California","/wiki/Health_system","/wiki/Hospital#Types","/wiki/Teaching_hospital","/wiki/University","http://www.whitememorial.com/","/wiki/List_of_hospitals_in_California","/wiki/Hospital","/wiki/Adventist_Health","/wiki/Loma_Linda_University","/wiki/Myron_Hunt","/wiki/Rose_Bowl_(stadium)","/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency","/wiki/Behavioral_medicine","/wiki/Nurses","/wiki/World_wars","/wiki/Great_Depression","/wiki/U.S._News_and_World_Report","/wiki/HealthGrades","/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&action=edit&section=1","http://www.whitememorial.com/","http://www.adventisthealth.org/","http://gis.oshpd.ca.gov/atlas/places/facility/106190878","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&params=34_02_57_N_118_13_04_W_type:landmark_source:kolossus-frwiki","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&oldid=565472693","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Hospitals_in_Los_Angeles,_California","/wiki/Category:Hospitals_affiliated_with_the_Seventh-day_Adventist_Church","/wiki/Category:Adventist_Health","/wiki/Category:Boyle_Heights,_Los_Angeles","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=White+Memorial+Medical+Center&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=White+Memorial+Medical+Center","/wiki/White_Memorial_Medical_Center","/wiki/Talk:White_Memorial_Medical_Center","#","/wiki/White_Memorial_Medical_Center","/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/White_Memorial_Medical_Center","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/White_Memorial_Medical_Center","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&oldid=565472693","/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1441868","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&id=565472693","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=White+Memorial+Medical+Center","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=White+Memorial+Medical+Center&oldid=565472693&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=White_Memorial_Medical_Center&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Memorial_Medical_Center","//pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centro_M%C3%A9dico_Memorial_White","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1441868#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Memorial_Medical_Center","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikim
