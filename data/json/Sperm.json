{"cursor":"13537","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe term 'sperm' is derived from the Greek word (ÏÏÎ­ÏÎ¼Î±) sperma (meaning \"seed\")\nand refers to the male reproductive cells. In the types of sexual reproduction\nknown as anisogamy and oogamy, there is a marked difference in the size of the\ngametes with the smaller one being termed the \"male\" or sperm cell. A\nuniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a '[[spermatozoon]]',\nwhereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a 'spermatium'. Sperm cells\ncannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells\nduring fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent\nzygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the\n23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm\ndevelops in the testicles and is released from the penis.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Sperm","recorded":1362374005,"links":32,"instances":["flower","fungus","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.ncbio.org/NcBioBurrell.pdf","http://static.dna.gov/lab-manual/Linked%20Documents/Protocols/pdi_lab_pro_2.05.pdf","http://static.dna.gov/lab-manual/Linked%20Documents/Protocols/pdi_lab_pro_2.05.pdf","http://www.channel4.com/microsites/G/TGSR/PDF/Great-Sperm-Race.pdf"],"categories":["Fertility","Germ cells","Mammal male reproductive system","Reproduction","Semen"],"headings":["Sperm in animals","Sperm in plants","Motile sperm cells","Non-motile sperm cells","Sperm nuclei","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Complete_diagram_of_a_human_spermatozoa_en.svg/350px-Complete_diagram_of_a_human_spermatozoa_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Sperm-egg.jpg/200px-Sperm-egg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Sperm_stained.JPG/200px-Sperm_stained.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Plant_sperm.png/220px-Plant_sperm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["rust","fungus"],["stigma","flower"]],"members":["stigma","rust","cell"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Sexual_reproduction","Anisogamy","Oogamy","Gamete","Motility","Ovum","Totipotency","Zygote","Human","Haploid","Diploid","Testicles","Penis","Cell_nucleus","Acrosome","Adenosine_triphosphate","Cervix","Uterus","Uterine_tubes","Flagellum","Fertilization","Oocyte","Metabolically","Genome","Centrosome","Microtubule","Animal","Spermatogenesis","Gonad","Testicle","Meiosis","Spermatozoon","Spermatid","Spermatozoan","Semen","Seminal_vesicles","Prostate_gland","Urethral_gland","Quantity","Semen_quality","Semen","Fertilization","Fertility","Man","Paternal_age_effect","Denmark","Sperm_quality","Paraguay","Canada","Kenya","Hong_Kong","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Creutzfeldt-Jakob_disease","Blood-testis_barrier","Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek","Microscope","Animalcule","Preformationism","Uv_light","Microscopy","Gametophyte","Gametangium","Antheridium","Mitosis","Flowering_plant","Pollen","Flagellum","Fructose","Semen","Mitochondria","Animal","Protist","Gametophyte","Bryophyte","Fern","Gymnosperm","Cycad","Ginkgo","Lycophyte","Nematode","Amoeboid","Gametangium","Red_alga","Rust_(fungus)","Nectar","Fly","Hyphae","Insect_pollination","Flowering_plant","Conidium","Spore","Gamete","Land_plant","Angiosperm","Gametophyte","Pollen","Biological_dispersal","Pollination","Stigma_(flower)","Pollen_tube","Carpel","Ovule","Ovule","Protist","Cell_nucleus","Oomycete","Syncytium","Antheridium","Ejaculation","Female_sperm","Female_sperm_storage","Polyspermy","Semen","Sperm_competition","Sperm_donation","Sperm_granuloma","Spermatogenesis","Spermatozoon"]}
