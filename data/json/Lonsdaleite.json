In nature, it forms when meteorites containing\ngraphite strike the Earth. The great heat and stress of the impact transforms\nthe graphite into diamond, but retains graphite's hexagonal crystal lattice.\nLonsdaleite was first identified in 1967 from the Canyon Diablo meteorite, where\nit occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond.\n\nHexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory (1966 or earlier;\npublished in 1967) by compressing and heating graphite either in a\nstatic press or using explosives. It has also been produced by\nchemical vapor deposition, and also by the\nthermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(hydridocarbyne), at atmospheric\npressure, under argon atmosphere, at temperature .\n\nIt is translucent, brownish-yellow in color, and has an index of refraction of\n2.40 to 2.41, a specific gravity of 3.2 to 3.3, and a Mohs hardness of 7â8. The Mohs hardness of diamond is 10, and the lower hardness of\nlonsdaleite is chiefly attributed to impurities and imperfections in the\nnaturally occurring material. A simulated pure sample has been found to be 58%\nharder than diamond.\n","linknr":394,"url":"Lonsdaleite","recorded":1362375346,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/lonsdaleite.pdf","http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2268163/Mexico%20YD%20Paper.pdf","http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2268163/Mexico%20YD%20Paper.pdf"],"categories":["Native element minerals","Meteorite minerals","Carbon forms","Superhard materials"],"headings":["Properties","Occurrence","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Lonsdaleite2.PNG/240px-Lonsdaleite2.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["poly(hydridocarbyne"]],"members":[],"related":["H-M_symbol","Space_group","Hexagonal_crystal_system","Kathleen_Lonsdale","Crystal_structure","Allotrope_of_carbon","Meteor","Graphite","Crystal_lattice","Canyon_Diablo_meteorite","Chemical_synthesis","Graphite","Chemical_vapor_deposition","Poly(hydridocarbyne)","Refractive_index","Specific_gravity","Mohs_hardness_scale","Hexagonal_crystal_system","Unit_cell","Diamond","Close-packing","Crystal_system","Chair_conformation","Boat_conformation","Staggered_conformation","Eclipsed_conformation","Miller_index","GPa","Diamond_type","Material_properties_of_diamond","Canyon_Diablo_meteorite","Kenna_meteorite","Allan_Hills_77283","Tunguska_impact_site","Placer_deposit","Sakha_Republic","Guanajuato","Younger_Dryas","Glossary_of_meteoritics","List_of_minerals","List_of_minerals_named_after_people"]}
