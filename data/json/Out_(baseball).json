{"cursor":"5722","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" baseball card illustrating a baserunner being tagged out at third base.]]\n\nIn baseball, an 'out' occurs when the defensive, or fielding, team effects any\nof a number of different events, and the umpire rules a batter or baserunner\nout. When a player is called out, he is said to be 'retired'. When three outs\nare recorded in an inning during a team's turn at offense, that team's half of\nthe inning finishes, and it is said that \"the side is retired.\"\n\nThe most common ways batters or runners are put out are by strikeouts, fly\nouts, tag outs, and force outs, however there are many somewhat rarer ways an\nout can occur.\n\n* The batter is out when: ** the third strike is pitched and caught in flight;\n  ** on any third strike, if a baserunner is on first and there are fewer than\n  two outs; ** he bunts foul with two strikes; ** he is hit by his own fair\n  ball, outside of the batter's box, before the ball is played by a fielder; **\n  he commits interference; ** he fails to bat in his proper turn and is\n  discovered in an appeal; ** he hits a pitch while one foot is entirely outside\n  of the batter's box; ** he steps from one batter's box to the other when the\n  pitcher is ready to pitch; or ** he is found to have used an altered bat.\n\n* The batter-runner is out when: ** he fails to reach first base before a\n  fielder with a live ball in his possession touches first base or tags the batter-\n  runner (except when the batter is awarded first base, such as on a base on\n  balls); ** a batted ball is caught in flight (fly out); or ** he hits an\n  infield popup while the infield fly rule applies.\n\n* Any baserunner, other than the batter-runner, is out when: ** he is forced\n  out; that is, he fails to reach his force base before a fielder with a live\n  ball touches that base; ** a fielder catches a batted ball in flight, and\n  subsequently, some fielder with a live ball in possession touches the runner's\n  time of pitch base before the runner tags up (appeal play); ** while he is\n  attempting to reach home plate with fewer than two outs, the batter interferes\n  with a fielder and such action hinders a potential tag out near home plate; **\n  he is found to have committed a mockery of the game, for example a stolen base\n  of first from second; ** he is found to be an illegal substitute.\n\n* Any baserunner, including the batter-runner, is out when: ** he is tagged out;\n  that is, touched by a fielder's hand holding a live ball while in jeopardy,\n  such as while not touching a base; ** he passes a base without touching it and\n  a member of the defensive team properly executes a live ball appeal; ** he\n  commits interference, such as when he contacts a fielder playing a batted\n  ball, or when he contacts a live batted ball before it passes a fielder other\n  than the pitcher; ** he strays more than three feet (.91 meters) from his\n  running baseline in attempting to avoid a tag; ** he passes a preceding runner\n  who is not out; ** he is touched by a fair ball in fair territory before the\n  ball has touched or passed an infielder. The ball is dead and no runner may\n  score, nor runners advance, except runners forced to advance. EXCEPTION: If a\n  runner is touching his base when touched by an Infield Fly, he is not out,\n  although the batter is out; ** he intentionally abandons his effort to run the\n  bases; or ** he runs the bases in reverse order in an attempt to confuse the\n  defense or to make a travesty of the game.\n","linknr":273,"url":"Out_(baseball)","recorded":1375076889,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Out_(baseball)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Out_(baseball)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:1911_out_at_third_baseball_card.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/1911_out_at_third_baseball_card.jpg/250px-1911_out_at_third_baseball_card.jpg","/wiki/File:1911_out_at_third_baseball_card.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/American_Tobacco_Company","/wiki/Baseball_card","/wiki/Baserunner","/wiki/Tagged_out","/wiki/Third_base","/wiki/Baseball_positions","/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)","/wiki/Batter_(baseball)","/wiki/Baserunner","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Batting_(baseball)","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Fly_out","/wiki/Tag_out","/wiki/Force_play","/wiki/Batter_(baseball)","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/In_flight","/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)","/wiki/Batter%27s_box","/wiki/Interference_(baseball)","/wiki/Batting_out_of_turn","/wiki/Appeal_(baseball)","/wiki/Batter%27s_box","/wiki/Batter-runner","/wiki/Live_ball_(baseball)","/wiki/Tag_out","/wiki/Base_on_balls","/wiki/Fly_out","/wiki/Infield_fly","/wiki/Baserunner","/wiki/Force_play","/wiki/Force_base","/wiki/Time_of_pitch","/wiki/Tag_up","/wiki/Appeal_play","/wiki/Stolen_base","/wiki/Tag_out","/wiki/Tag_out","/wiki/Appeal_play","/wiki/Interference_(baseball)","/wiki/Baseline_(baseball)","/w/index.php?title=Out_(baseball)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Putout","/wiki/Assist_(baseball)","/wiki/Catcher","/wiki/Innings_pitched","/wiki/Earned_run_average","/wiki/Strikeout","/w/index.php?title=Out_(baseball)&action=edit&section=2","http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp","http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/runner_7.jsp","/wiki/Template:Baseball","/wiki/Template_talk:Baseball","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Baseball&action=edit","/wiki/Baseball","/wiki/Baseball_field","/wiki/Backstop_(baseball)","/wiki/Baseball_field","/wiki/Batter%27s_box","/wiki/Batter%27s_eye","/wiki/Bullpen","/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)","/wiki/Foul_territory","/wiki/Foul_pole","/wiki/Infield","/wiki/On-deck","/wiki/Outfield","/wiki/Strike_zone","/wiki/Warning_track","/wiki/Baseball_clothing_and_equipment","/wiki/Baseball_bat","/wiki/Baseball_(ball)","/wiki/Baseball_glove","/wiki/Batting_glove","/wiki/Batting_helmet","/wiki/Baseball_cap","/wiki/Baseball_doughnut","/wiki/Baseball_stirrups","/wiki/Baseball_uniform","/wiki/Uniform_number_(Major_League_Baseball)","/wiki/Shin_guard","/wiki/Jockstrap#Protective_cup","/wiki/Batting_cage","/wiki/Pitching_machine","/wiki/Innings","/wiki/Extra_innings","/wiki/Seventh-inning_stretch","/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)","/wiki/Run_(baseball)","/wiki/On-deck","/wiki/Batting_(baseball)","/wiki/At_bat","/wiki/Plate_appearance","/wiki/Hit_and_run_(baseball)","/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt","/wiki/Sacrifice_fly","/wiki/Slap_bunt","/wiki/Baltimore_chop","/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)","/wiki/Designated_hitter","/wiki/Foul_ball","/wiki/Foul_tip","/wiki/Checked_swing","/wiki/Ground_rule_double","/wiki/Hit_(baseball)","/wiki/Infield_hit","/wiki/Hit_by_pitch","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Single_(baseball)","/wiki/Double_(baseball)","/wiki/Triple_(baseball)","/wiki/Home_run","/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)","/wiki/Inside-the-park_home_run","/wiki/Walk-off_home_run","/wiki/Lefty-righty_switch","/wiki/Double_switch_(baseball)","/wiki/Line_drive","/wiki/Count_(baseball)","/wiki/Sweet_spot_(sports)","/wiki/Pull_hitter","/wiki/Hitting_for_the_cycle","/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)","/wiki/Balk","/wiki/Beanball","/wiki/Breaking_ball","/wiki/Brushback_pitch","/wiki/Changeup","/wiki/Curveball","/wiki/Fastball","/wiki/Full_count","/wiki/Inside_pitching","/wiki/Knuckleball","/wiki/Passed_ball","/wiki/Pitch_count","/wiki/Pitchout","/wiki/Quick_pitch","/wiki/Shutouts_in_baseball","/wiki/Slider","/wiki/Spitball","/wiki/Strikeout","/wiki/Striking_out_the_side","/wiki/Wild_pitch","/wiki/Time_of_pitch","/wiki/No-hitter","/wiki/Perfect_game","/wiki/Baserunning","/wiki/Balk","/wiki/Bases_loaded","/wiki/Caught_stealing","/wiki/Left_on_base","/wiki/Safe_(baseball)","/wiki/Scoring_position","/wiki/Small_ball","/wiki/Squeeze_pl
