In a series of experiments, they showed\nthat these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic\npathways. These experiments led them to propose a direct link between genes and\nenzymatic reactions, known as the \"one gene, one enzyme\" hypothesis. {{Cite\njournal |author=Beadle GW, Tatum EL |date = 15 November 1941 |title = Genetic\nControl of Biochemical Reactions in Neurospora |url =\nhttp://www.pnas.org/content/27/11/499.short |journal = PNAS |volume = 27 | issue\n= 11 | pages = 499â506 |doi=10.1073/pnas.27.11.499 |pmc=1078370 |pmid=16588492\n|bibcode = 1941PNAS...27..499B }}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1078370/pdf/pnas01634-\n0009.pdf]\n","linknr":349,"url":"George_Wells_Beadle","recorded":1362374053,"links":51,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf","http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/beadle-g-w.pdf"],"categories":["1903 births","1989 deaths","American geneticists","American Nobel laureates","Stanford University School of Medicine faculty","Cornell University alumni","Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine","People from Saunders County, Nebraska","Harvard University faculty","Presidents of the University of Chicago","Recipients of the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research","University of Chicago faculty","University of Nebraska–Lincoln alumni","California Institute of Technology faculty","Wesleyan University people","Foreign Members of the Royal Society","Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences"],"headings":["Biography","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/George_Wells_Beadle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Wahoo,_Nebraska","Nebraska","United_States","Chicago","Illinois","United_States","Genetics","University_of_Nebraska","Cornell_University","California_Institute_of_Technology","University_of_Chicago","Harvard_University","Stanford_University","Gene","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Christian","Scientist","Genetics","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Nobel_laureate","Edward_Lawrie_Tatum","Gene","Mold","X-ray","Mutation","Enzyme","Metabolic_pathway","PNAS","Wahoo,_Nebraska","University_of_Nebraska","Cornell_University","California_Institute_of_Technology","Boris_Ephrussi","Harvard_University","Stanford_University","American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences","Genetics_Society_of_America","Royal_Society","Millard,_Nebraska","Millard_Public_Schools","One_gene-one_enzyme","Lawrence_A._Kimpton","Edward_H._Levi","Genetics","Wahoo,_Nebraska","United_States","Chicago,_Illinois","United_States"]}
