Breathing is only one process that delivers\noxygen to where it is needed in the body and removes carbon dioxide. Another\nimportant process involves the movement of blood by the circulatory\nsystem. Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary alveoli by passive\ndiffusion of gases between the alveolar gas and the blood in lung capillaries.\nOnce these dissolved gases are in the blood, the heart powers their flow around\nthe body (via the circulatory system). The medical term for normal relaxed\nbreathing is eupnea.\n\nIn addition to removing carbon dioxide, breathing results in loss of water from\nthe body. Exhaled air has a relative humidity of 100% because of water diffusing\nacross the moist surface of breathing passages and alveoli.\n","linknr":436,"url":"Breathing","recorded":1362555671,"links":83,"instances":["medical"],"pdf":["http://www.dianahacker.com/pdfs/Hacker-Mart-CBE.pdf"],"categories":["Respiration","Reflexes","Human body"],"headings":["Mechanics","Control of breathing","Breathing in gas","Cultural significance","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Respiratory_system_complete_en.svg/220px-Respiratory_system_complete_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["hypoxia"],"related":["Aerobic_respiration","Organism","Cellular_respiration","Metabolism","Molecule","Glucose","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Gas_exchange","Alveoli","Passive_diffusion","Lung","Capillaries","Blood","Heart","Circulatory_system","Eupnea","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Relative_humidity","Mammals","Amphibians","Positive_pressure_breathing","Yoga","Pranayama","Anapana","Human_swimming","Cardio","Physical_fitness","Speech_communication","Vocal","Discipline","Conscious","Sub-conscious","Buteyko_method","Brainstem","Carbonic_acid","Lactic_acid_fermentation","Exercise","PH","Carotid_body","Aortic_bodies","Medulla_oblongata","Respiration_centre","Medulla_oblongata","Pons","Phrenic_nerve","Thoracic_nerve","Thoracic_diaphragm","Cellular_respiration","Muscle","Air_hunger","Reflex","Mammalian_diving_reflex","Suspended_animation","Consciousness","Suicide","Drowning","Hyperventilating","Bohr_effect","Fainting","Brain_hypoxia","Oxygen","Breathing_gas","Air","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Argon","Carbon_dioxide","Helium","Water","Gases","Underwater_diving","Analgesic","Space_suit","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Argon","Water_vapor","Hydrogen","Carbon_monoxide","Ammonia","Acetone","Methanol","Ethanol","Breathalyzer","Volatile_organic_compounds","Cellular_respiration","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Altitude_sickness","Hypoxia_(medical)","Nitrogen_narcosis","Oxygen_toxicity","Decompression_sickness","T'ai_chi_ch'uan","Aerobic_training","Thoracic_diaphragm","Aerophones","Laughter","Hiccups","Yawn","Sneeze","Hebrew_Bible","Nephesh","Psyche","Mana","Ruach","Apnea","Breath_gas_analysis","Diaphragmatic_breathing","Kussmaul_breathing","Agonal_breathing","Cheyne-Stokes_respiration","Biot's_respiration","Mouth_breathing","Nose_breathing","Pneuma","Prana","Qi","Respiratory_rate","Spirit","Halitosis","Liquid_breathing","Carbon_cycle","Buteyko_method"]}
