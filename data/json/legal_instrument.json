Many legal instruments were written under seal by affixing a wax or paper\nseal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which\noften removes the need for consideration in contract law); however, today many\njurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal\nin order to give them legal effect. Others, such as Australia, have re-\ninterpreted sealing as a formally attested signature.\n",
