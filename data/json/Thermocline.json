{"cursor":"7994","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'thermocline' (sometimes 'metalimnion') is a thin but distinct layer in a\nlarge body of fluid (e.g. water, such as an ocean or lake, or air, such as an\natmosphere) in which temperature changes more rapidly with depth than it does\nin the layers above or below. In the ocean, the thermocline may be thought of\nas an invisible blanket which separates the upper mixed layer from the calm\ndeep water below. Depending largely on season, latitude and turbulent mixing\nby wind, thermoclines may be a semi-permanent feature of the body of water in\nwhich they occur or they may form temporarily in response to phenomena such\nas the radiative heating/cooling of surface water during the day/night.\nFactors that affect the depth and thickness of a thermocline include seasonal\nweather variations, latitude and local environmental conditions, such as\ntides and currents.\n","linknr":371,"url":"Thermocline","recorded":1362672776,"links":37,"instances":["meteorology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anti-submarine warfare","Oceanography","Physical oceanography","Aquatic ecology","Fisheries science","Limnology"],"headings":["Oceans","Other water bodies","Atmosphere","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Thermocline.jpg/200px-Thermocline.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Upwelling.svg/140px-Upwelling.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png/140px-Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["inversion","meteorology"]],"members":["inversion"],"related":["Waves","Mixed_layer","Sound_speed_gradient","Submarine_warfare","Sonar","Scuba_diving","Refraction","Schlieren","Mirage","Epilimnion","Hypolimnion","Algal_bloom","Phytoplankton","Thermal_bar","Seiche","Troposphere","Stratosphere","Tropopause","Inversion_(meteorology)","Noise_pollution","Noise_barrier","Bathythermograph","Buoyancy","Deep_sound_channel","Lake_stratification","Noise_barrier","Southern_Oscillation","Thermohaline_circulation"]}
