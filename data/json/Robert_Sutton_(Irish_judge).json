{"cursor":"2562","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Robert Sutton' (c.1340-1430) was an Irish judge and Crown official. Over a\ncareer which lasted almost 60 years he served the Crown in a great variety of\noffices, notably as Deputy to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Chief Baron of the\nIrish Exchequer, Master of the Rolls in Ireland, and Deputy Treasurer of\nIreland. Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray\nLondon 1926 Vol.1 p.87 A royal warrant of 1423 praises his long and\nlaudable service.\n\nLittle is known of his early life: the surname has been common in Ireland\nsince the thirteenth century, especially in the south. William Sutton, who\nacted as his deputy and succeeded him as Master of the Rolls is thought to\nhave been his nephew.\n\nHe was appointed to the living of Trim, County Meath in 1370; later he became\nArchdeacon of Kells, and prebendary of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin and later\nof Ossory. Ball p.87\n\nHe is mentioned as chief clerk in the Irish Chancery in 1373, jointly with\nThomas de Everdon: an order in Council states that they should share the\nannual fee of Â£20.. Ball p.87 As a judge he served in a variety of\noffices over many years. He was appointed Master of the Rolls in 1377 and\nreturned to that office at regular intervals over the next fifty years: his\nfinal warrant of appointment granted in 1423 apparently confirmed him in\noffice for life. Smyth, Constantine Joseph Chronicle of the Law Officers\nof Ireland Henry Butterworth London 1839 p.53 He also served as Deputy\nLord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal of Ireland on many occasions and\nwas Deputy Escheator in1380. He was briefly Chief Baron of the Irish\nExchequer c.1401.\n\nIn the political sphere he was summoned to the Irish Parliament at Kilkenny in\n1390, was Deputy Treasurer in 1403, and was instructed to grant an amnesty to\nthe noted Irish leader Art MÃ³r Mac Murchadha CaomhÃ¡nach (Art MacMurrough-\nKavanagh) in 1409.\n\nIn 1423 he was praised for his laudable service to five monarchs. He died in\n1430 when he must have been close to 90.
