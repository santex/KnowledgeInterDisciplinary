{"cursor":"29243","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Volatile organic compounds' ('VOCs') are organic chemicals that have a high\nvapor pressure at ordinary, room-temperature conditions. Their high vapor\npressure results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of\nmolecules to evaporate or sublimate from the liquid or solid form of the\ncompound and enter the surrounding air. An example is formaldehyde, with a\nboiling point of â19 Â°C (â2 Â°F), slowly exiting paint and getting into the air.\n\nVOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and\nnaturally occurring chemical compounds. Most scents or odors are of VOCs. VOCs\nplay an important role in communication between plants.  Some VOCs\nare dangerous to human health or cause harm to the environment. Anthropogenic\nVOCs are regulated by law, especially indoors, where concentrations are the\nhighest. Harmful VOCs are typically not acutely toxic, but instead have\ncompounding long-term health effects. Because the concentrations are usually low\nand the symptoms slow to develop, research into VOCs and their effects is\ndifficult.\n","linknr":425,"url":"Volatile_organic_compound","recorded":1362508793,"links":34,"instances":["chemistry","phase_transition"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/method/files/524_2.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/method/files/524_2.pdf","http://www.ccme.ca/assets/pdf/pn_1257_e.pdf"],"categories":["Building biology","Organic compounds","Pollutants","Smog","Flavors","Fragrances"],"headings":["Definitions","Biologically generated VOCs","Anthropogenic sources","Health risks","Chemical fingerprinting","VOCs Sensors","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","phase_transition"],["orders_of_magnitude","mass#106_to_1011_kg"],["orders_of_magnitude","mass#106_to_1011_kg"],["volatility","chemistry"]],"members":["volatility","orders_of_magnitude","sublimation"],"related":["Organic_chemicals","Vapor_pressure","Room_temperature","Evaporation","Sublimation_(phase_transition)","Formaldehyde","Paint","Odor","Natural_environment","Anthropogenic_behaviour","Toxic","SCAQMD","California_Air_Resources_Board","Indoor_air_quality","Health_Canada","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Safe_Drinking_Water_Act","CERCLA","United_States_Department_of_Labor","Hazardous_material","Pipeline_and_Hazardous_Materials_Safety_Administration","Methane","Carbon","Isoprene","Fungi","Molds","Green_leaf_volatiles","Biosynthesis","Stomata","Terpene","Myrcene","Anthropogenic","Carbon","Ethyl_acetate","Acetone","Aqueous_solution","Chlorofluorocarbon","Fossil_fuels","Gasoline","MTBE","Aquifers","Sick_building_syndrome","Outgassing","Leukemia","Lymphoma","National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health","Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration","Butanol","Hexane","Benzene","France","Germany","United_States","Formaldehyde","Styrene","Limonene","Nitrogen_oxides","Photochemical_smog","Throat_irritation","Dyspnea","Cholinesterase","Biomarker","Lung_cancer","Environmental_tobacco_smoke","Aroma_compound","Criteria_air_contaminants","Dutch_standards","Fugitive_emissions","NMVOC","NoVOC","Organic_compound","Photochemical_smog","Volatility_(chemistry)","NTA_Inc","Volatile_Organic_Compounds_Protocol","Ozone"]}
