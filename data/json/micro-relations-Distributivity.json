{"cursor":"11102","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In abstract algebra and logic, 'distributivity' is a property of binary\noperations that generalizes the 'distributive law' from elementary algebra. In\npropositional logic, 'distribution' refers to two valid rules of replacement.\nThe rules allow one to reformulate conjunctions and disjunctions within\nlogical proofs.\n\nFor example, in arithmetic:\n: 2 Ã (1 + 3) = (2 Ã 1) + (2 Ã 3) but 2 /(1 + 3) is not equal to (2 / 1) +\n: (2 / 3).\n\nIn the left-hand side of the first equation, the 2 multiplies the sum of 1 and\n3; on the right-hand side, it multiplies the 1 and the 3 individually, with the\nproducts added afterwards. Because these give the same final answer (8), we say\nthat multiplication by 2 distributes over addition of 1 and 3. Since we could\nhave put any real numbers in place of 2, 1, and 3 above, and still have obtained\na true equation, we say that multiplication of real numbers distributes over\naddition of real numbers.\n","linknr":275,"url":"Distributivity","recorded":1362484191,"links":46,"instances":["algebra","formal","structure","order_theory","mathematics","algebra","mathematics","logic","set_theory","order","mathematics","category_theory","set_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abstract algebra","Binary operations|*Distributivity","Elementary algebra","Rules of inference","Theorems in propositional logic"],"headings":["Definition","Propositional logic","Examples","Distributivity and rounding","Distributivity in rings","Generalizations of distributivity","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/9/f/c9fc46c11c29ecd1eff37e589504f34a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/6/446ad13289d7c5b3ebf8259cf8402317.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/4/014cced2b73c22eb88cdc6901afb0c9d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/a/d/3ad42804069fc808be3189e62944eb76.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/5/5a5f2d4dd30721280da31cf10638d6fe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/8/0/e803f17a9add1accc54e49f80a4ba84e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/3/d/73da021e5b7c51429b6fb90e0ca97692.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/4/d/d4d865fdd6dbbf8da7968c54ee876070.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/5/3/c5387f6c71f29fd046c5dae56fc6a3ba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/f/d/3fdeb6e2c3085c9822c53b31ea52fefc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/6/506b59133edad0c965150e42fc556374.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/d/6/fd68e88decc59b7650d5d519945b4526.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["symbol","formal"],["tautology","logic"],["matrix","mathematics"],["union","set_theory"],["intersection","set_theory"],["ring","algebra"],["lattice","order"],["distributivity","order_theory"],["boolean_algebra","structure"],["near-field","mathematics"],["rig","algebra"],["distributivity","order_theory"],["monad","category_theory"],["category","mathematics"]],"members":["rig","symbol","boolean_algebra","distributivity","ring","matrix","tautology","intersection","lattice","category","monad","union","set"],"related":["Abstract_algebra","Logic","Binary_operation","Elementary_algebra","Propositional_calculus","Validity","Rule_of_replacement","Logical_conjunction","Logical_disjunction","Formal_proof","Arithmetic","Real_number","Multiplication","Addition","Set_(mathematics)","Binary_operator","Given_any","Given_any","Commutative","Logical_equivalence","Logical_connective","Well-formed_formula","Metalogic","Symbol_(formal)","Propositional_logic","Tautology_(logic)","Bertrand_Russell","Alfred_Whitehead","Bertrand_Russell","Alfred_Whitehead","Number","Natural_number","Complex_number","Cardinal_number","Ordinal_number","Cross_product","Vector_addition","Matrix_(mathematics)","Matrix_multiplication","Matrix_addition","Union_(set_theory)","Intersection_(set_theory)","Real_number","Totally_ordered_set","Integer","Greatest_common_divisor","Least_common_multiple","Arithmetic_precision","Decimal_arithmetic","Significant_digit","Significant_digit","VAT","Ring_(algebra)","Distributive_lattice","Lattice_(order)","Algebraic_structure","Distributivity_(order_theory)","Boolean_algebra_(structure)","Boolean_ring","Boolean_lattice","Near-ring","Near-field_(mathematics)","Division_ring","Rig_(algebra)","Near-rig","Order_theory","Infinite_distributive_law","Distributivity_(order_theory)","Interval_arithmetic","Category_theory","Monad_(category_theory)","Category_(mathematics)","Natural_transformation","Lax_map_of_monads","Colax_map_of_monads","Distributive_law_between_monads","Generalized_distributive_law","Information_theory","Cut-the-knot"]}
