Such messages typically involve divine inspiration, interpretation, or\nrevelation of conditioned events to come (cf. divine knowledge) as well as\ntestimonies or repeated revelations that the world is divine. The process of\nprophecy especially involves reciprocal communication of the prophet with the\n(divine) source of the messages.\n\nVarious concepts of prophecy are found throughout all of the world's religions\nand cults. To a certain degree prophecy can be an integral concept within any\nreligion or cult. The term has found deep usage in the Abrahamic religions,\nincluding Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Baha'i and Mormonism along with many\nothers.
