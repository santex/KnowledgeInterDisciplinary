{"cursor":"6417","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Playwrights Guild of Canada' (PGC) is a registered national arts service\nassociation mandated to advance the creative rights and interests of\nprofessional Canadian playwrights, promote Canadian plays nationally and\ninternationally, and foster an active, evolving community of writers for the\nstage. It was founded in 1972 as the Playwrights Co-op. The main purpose was to\npublish and distribute scripts to encourage more productions of Canadian plays.\nSince then, it has grown and now provides programs and services for playwrights\nacross the country, and now includes more than 600 playwrights. PGC provides\npromotional and advocacy programs and services for the creative rights of\nCanadian playwrights.\n\nThrough its independently run subsidiary, Playwrights Canada Press, which was\nestablished in 2002, PGC is a primary source for unpublished Canadian plays, as\nwell as information regarding performance rights.\n\nTo help support and advance Canadian playwriting, PGC offers the following\nservices to its members:\n* Publication of CanScene, PGC's monthly newsletter, which includes calls for\n  submissions, jobs and other opportunities;\n* Promotion of Canadian playwrights via print publications, the PGC website,\n  social media networks, and other means;\n* Advertising, selling, and distributing published and unpublished plays;\n* Administering amateur production rights;\n* Facilitating the Canada Council Readings Program, which creates opportunities\n  for organizations such as universities, libraries and community groups to\n  invite Canadian playwrights to read in public venues by paying the\n  playwright's reading fees and subsidizing their travel expenses;\n* Professional development workshops;\n* And overseeing member enrolment in the AFBS RRSP Investment Plan and the\n  Writer's Coalition Insurance Program.\n\nPGC also publishes CanRevue, an electronic catalogue of Canadian Copyscript\nplays, on a monthly timetable. CanRevue promotes new Canadian plays and is\nsometimes released as a special edition pertaining to genre or geographical\nregion. In 2011, PGC added a section within CanRevue entitled \"Stage Ready\".\nThis is intended to narrow the gap between a written work and a production, and\nallows members to send PGC plays that have not yet been produced, but are ready\nto be promoted for the stage. CanRevue is sent out to over two hundred theatres\n(both professional and amateur) and to schools across Canada.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada","recorded":1375065349,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:PGC40_BrandIdentity_Basic-2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/PGC40_BrandIdentity_Basic-2.jpg/220px-PGC40_BrandIdentity_Basic-2.jpg","/wiki/File:PGC40_BrandIdentity_Basic-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Playwright","#cite_note-PGC-1","#cite_note-CdnEncyclopedia-2","/wiki/Canada","/wiki/Performance_right","#cite_note-PGC-1","#cite_note-CdnEncyclopedia-2","#History","#Awards","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Canada_Council","/wiki/Carol_Bolt","/wiki/Len_Peterson","/wiki/English_Canadian","#cite_note-CdnEncyclopedia-2","#cite_note-CdnEncyclopedia-2","#cite_note-CdnEncyclopedia-2","#cite_note-CdnEncyclopedia-2","#cite_note-CdnEncyclopedia-2","/wiki/Charitable_organziations_(Canada)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Canada_Council","/wiki/Ontario_Arts_Council","/wiki/Toronto","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Stage_West_Pechet_Family_Comedy_Award&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Stage_West_Pechet_Family_Musical_Award&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tom_Hendry","/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-PGC_1-0","#cite_ref-PGC_1-1","http://www.playwrightscanada.com","#cite_ref-CdnEncyclopedia_2-0","#cite_ref-CdnEncyclopedia_2-1","#cite_ref-CdnEncyclopedia_2-2","#cite_ref-CdnEncyclopedia_2-3","#cite_ref-CdnEncyclopedia_2-4","#cite_ref-CdnEncyclopedia_2-5","#cite_ref-CdnEncyclopedia_2-6","http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0006343","/wiki/The_Canadian_Encyclopedia","#cite_ref-3","http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=s67275","#cite_ref-4","http://www.straight.com/article-330069/vancouver/touchstone-theatres-katrina-dunn-feted-being-femalefriendly","/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit&section=4","http://www.playwrightsguild.ca/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&oldid=560641365","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Theatrical_organizations_in_Canada","/wiki/Category:Canadian_writers%27_organizations","/wiki/Category:Organizations_established_in_1972","/wiki/Category:Organizations_based_in_Toronto","/wiki/Category:Non-profit_organizations_based_in_Canada","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_June_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_June_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Playwrights+Guild+of+Canada&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Playwrights+Guild+of+Canada","/wiki/Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada","/wiki/Talk:Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada","#","/wiki/Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada","/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Playwrights_Guild_of_Canada&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wik
