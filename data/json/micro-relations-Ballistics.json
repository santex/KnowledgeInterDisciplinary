{"cursor":"5908","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Ballistics' (gr. Î²Î¬Î»Î»ÎµÎ¹Î½ ('ba'llein'), \"throw\") is the science of mechanics\nthat deals with the flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles, especially\nbullets, gravity bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing\nand accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.\n\nA 'ballistic body' is a body which is free to move, behave, and be modified in\nappearance, contour, or texture by ambient conditions, substances, or forces, as\nby the pressure of gases in a gun or propulsive nozzle, by rifling in a barrel,\nby gravity, by temperature, or by air particles.\n\nA ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial\npowered phase of flight, whose trajectory is subsequently governed by the laws\nof classical mechanics. Modern inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),\ncontain a maneuverable orbiting bus that positions and releases ballistic\nwarheads in space using celestial navigation.\n","linknr":215,"url":"Ballistics","recorded":1362480318,"links":59,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.ballistics.org/docs/InteriorBallistics.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0462060&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf","http://www.ballistics.org/docs/Ballistic%20Fields%20-%20Launch%20Dynamics.pdf","http://www.ballistics.org/docs/Ballistic%20Fields%20-%20Exterior%20Ballistics.pdf","http://www.ballistics.org/docs/Ballistic%20Fields%20-%20Terminal%20Ballistics.pdf","http://castpics.net/subsite2/ClassicWorks/The_bullet_s_flight_from_powder_to_targe.pdf"],"categories":["Ballistics|"],"headings":["History","Gun ballistics","Forensic ballistics","Ballistics research","Astrodynamics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Bullet_coming_from_S%26W.jpg/220px-Bullet_coming_from_S%26W.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Greek_language","Mechanics","Flight","Projectile","Bullet","Gravity_bomb","Rocket","Gun","Propulsive_nozzle","Rifling","Gun_barrel","Gravity","Temperature","Ballistic_missile","Missile","Trajectory","Classical_mechanics","Intercontinental_ballistic_missile","Boomerang","Australia","Bullet","Rifle","Anti-tank_warfare","Slag","Forensic_science","Ballistic_fingerprinting","High_speed_photography","High-speed_camera","Ballistics","Celestial_mechanics","Rocket","Spacecraft","Newton's_laws_of_motion","Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation","Ballistic_conduction","Electron","Ballistic_limit","Bloodstain_pattern_analysis","Gunshot_injury","Gunshot_residue","Hydrostatic_shock","L.T.E._Thompson","Peter_Bielkowicz","Physics_of_firearms","Stopping_Power","Trajectory","Vaporific_Effect","The_Wolfram_Demonstrations_Project"]}
