The performers may communicate this experience to the audience\n through combinations of gesture, speech, song, music or dance. Elements of\n design and stagecraft are used to enhance the physicality, presence and\n immediacy of the experience. M. Carlson, Journal of Dramatic Theory and\n Criticism, [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jdtc/article/view/1642/1606],\n 2011 The specific place of the performance is also named by the word\n \"theatre\" as derived from the Ancient Greek Î¸Î­Î±ÏÏÎ¿Î½ (thÃ©atron, âa place for\n viewingâ) and Î¸ÎµÎ¬Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹ (theÃ¡omai, âto see\", \"to watch\", \"to observeâ).\n\nModern Western theatre derives in large measure from ancient Greek drama, from\nwhich it borrows technical terminology, classification into genres, and many of\nits themes, stock characters, and plot elements. Theatre scholar Patrice Pavis\ndefines theatricality, theatrical language, stage writing, and the specificity\nof theatre as synonymous expressions that differentiate theatre from the other\nperforming arts, literature, and the arts in general. Pavis (1998, 345).\nDrawing on the \"semeiotics\" of Charles Sanders Peirce, Pavis goes on to suggest\nthat \"the specificity of theatrical signs may lie in their ability to use the\nthree possible functions of signs: as icon (mimetically), as index (in the\nsituation of enunciation), or as symbol (as a semiological system in the\nfictional mode). In effect, theatre makes the sources of the words visual and\nconcrete: it indicates and incarnates a fictional world by means of signs, such\nthat by the end of the process of signification and symbolization the spectator\nhas reconstructed a theoretical and aesthetic model that accounts for the\ndramatic universe\" (1998, 346).\n\nTheatre today includes performances of plays and musicals. Although it can be\ndefined broadly to include opera and ballet, those art forms are outside the\nscope of this article.\n","linknr":1049,"url":"Theatre","recorded":1362372553,"links":152,"instances":["fiction","theatre","literature","classical_period","structure","director","athens","theatre","arts","ancient_athens","arts","aristotle","theatre","theatre","structure","philosophy","narrative","poetry","drama"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stage
