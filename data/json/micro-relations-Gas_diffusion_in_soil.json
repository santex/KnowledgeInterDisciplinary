This air space could also\ncontain carbon dioxide as a product of respiration of plant roots and soil\norganisms.\n\nComposition of air in soil and atmosphere: *Nitrogen: Soil Air: 79.2%\nAtmosphere: 79.0% *Oxygen: Soil Air: 20.6% Atmosphere: 20.9% *Carbon Dioxide:\nSoil Air: 0.25% Atmosphere: 0.03%\n\nGas molecules in soil are in continuous thermal motion according to the kinetic\ntheory of gases, there is also collision between molecules - a random walk.\n\nIn soil, a concentration gradient causes net movement of molecules from high\nconcentration to low concentration, this gives the movement of gas by diffusion.\n\nNumerically, it is explained by Fick's law of diffusion.\n\n'Soil gas' includes air, water vapour and the pollutants that might be picked up\nfrom the soil underneath a building and carried by air leakage into the\nbuilding. The chief concerns among these pollutants are radon and methane gases.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Gas_diffusion_in_soil","recorded":1362372899,"links":15,"instances":["physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soil physics","Soil"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Soil_profile.png/25px-Soil_profile.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["respiration","physiology"]],"members":["respiration"],"related":["Soil","Oxygen","Respiration_(physiology)","Root","Carbon_dioxide","Air","Atmosphere","Kinetic_theory_of_gases","Random_walk","Diffusion","Fick's_law_of_diffusion","Air_leakage","Radon","Methane"]}
