(The solidus does not appear in fractions on British road signs.)]] A\n'mile' is a unit of length, most commonly 5,280 feet (1,760 yards, or about\n1,609 meters). The mile of 5,280 feet is sometimes called the statute mile or\nland mile to distinguish it from the [[nautical mile]] (1,852 metres, about\n6,076.1 feet). [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]],\n4th ed., s.v. mile 1. There have also been many historical miles and\nsimilar units in other systems that may be translated into English as miles;\nthey have varied in length from 1 to 15 kilometres.\n\nThe exact length of the land mile varied slightly among English-speaking\ncountries until the international yard and pound agreement in 1959 established\nthe yard as exactly 0.9144 metres, giving a mile of exactly 1,609.344 metres.\nThe United States adopted this international mile for most purposes, but\nretained the pre-1959 mile for some land-survey data, terming it the US survey\nmile. In the US, statute mile formally refers to the survey mile, about\n3.219 mm (â inch) longer than the international mile (the\ninternational mile is exactly 0.0002% less than the US survey mile).\n\nUse of the mile as an official unit of measurement is now largely confined to\nthe United\nKingdom, [http://www.dft.gov.uk/trafficsignsimages/imagelist.php?CATID=6\nSpeed limit signs] (UK) Department for Transport.
