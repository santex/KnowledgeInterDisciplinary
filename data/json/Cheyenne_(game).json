The game is a typical track/racing board game. A second edition of the\ngame was released during Clint Walker's dispute with Warner Bros. that featured\n[[Bronco (TV series)|Bronco]] star Ty Hardin on the box cover. Cheyenne was one\nof many board games published during the 1950s based on television programs.\n\nIn addition to the typical center-seamed, illustrated game board, a spinner,\nand four tokens of various colors, the game includes four plastic \"revolvers\",\nfour plastic \"bullets\", and six small cardboard obstacles such as a rattlesnake\nand bandit.\n\n\n\nEach player moves in turn along the track in accordance with his spin on the\ndial. He must stop and \"shoot\" an obstacle when he reaches a space with a gun on\nit, even if his spin would have carried him beyond the gun space. The player\nsets the obstacle up on its corresponding illustration (Rattlesnake on the snake\npicture, for example) and removes all other counters from the game board. The\nplayer places one of the plastic disks (\"bullets\") on the orange circle in the\nlower left hand corner of the game board, then uses his plastic revolver\ntiddledy wink fashion to \"shoot\" the disk at the obstacle. He must move or knock\nover the obstacle with the disk in order to advance on the track. Each player\nmust shoot all six obstacles before entering the Pony Express Station at the end\nof the track. The game is won when one player defeats all six obstacles on the\ngame board and enters the Express Station by an exact spin.\n","linknr":105,"url":"Cheyenne_(game)","recorded":1375077680,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Cheyenne_(board_game)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(game)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Milton_Bradley_Company","/wiki/Milton_Bradley_Company","/wiki/Board_game","/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award","/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company","/wiki/Warner_Bros.","/wiki/Western_(genre)","/wiki/Television_series","/wiki/Cheyenne_(TV_western)","/wiki/Clint_Walker","/wiki/Bronco_(TV_series)","/wiki/Ty_Hardin","/wiki/Gun","/wiki/Illustration","/wiki/Rattlesnake","/wiki/Snake","/wiki/Plastic","/wiki/Bullet","/wiki/Revolver","/w/index.php?title=Tiddledy_wink&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pony_Express","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&action=edit&section=1","http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13036","/wiki/BoardGameGeek","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&oldid=545007441","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Roll-and-move_board_games","/wiki/Category:Children%27s_board_games","/wiki/Category:Milton_Bradley_games","/wiki/Category:Board_games_based_on_television_series","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_December_2007","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cheyenne+%28board+game%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Cheyenne+%28board+game%29","/wiki/Cheyenne_(board_game)","/wiki/Talk:Cheyenne_(board_game)","#","/wiki/Cheyenne_(board_game)","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Cheyenne_(board_game)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Cheyenne_(board_game)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&oldid=545007441","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3667323","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Cheyenne_%28board_game%29&id=545007441","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Cheyenne+%28board+game%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Cheyenne+%28board+game%29&oldid=545007441&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Cheyenne_(board_game)&printable=yes","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_(gioco_da_tavolo)","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3667323#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_(board_game)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],
