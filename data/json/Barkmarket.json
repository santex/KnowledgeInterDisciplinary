{"cursor":"3849","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Barkmarket' was a rock music group formed in New York City in 1987. Personnel\nwere singer/guitarist and main songwriter Dave Sardy, bass guitarist John Nowlin\nand drummer Rock Savage.\n\nBarkmarket's music was usually loud and aggressive, touching on many styles\n(most prominently including heavy metal, hardcore punk and noise rock), but not\nresting definitely in any one genre. Critic Stewart Mason wrote that the band\n\"can at times be frustratingly difficult to pin down, but their best work has a\nnoisy, rattling power.\"[] There were also odd touches that demonstrated an\nexperimental edge: the eerie banjo and tape loops on \"(Radio Static)\" (from\nGimmick), and the nearly delta blues acoustic slide guitar on \"Visible Cow\"\n(from L. Ron).\n\nSardy's ragged, proto-screamo vocals usually offered bizarre lyrics that were at\nonce evocative and absurd, and rarely without a menacing undercurrent: \"I bought\na handgun made out of glass/I cut a hole in the side of a wild ass\" (\"Visible\nCow\"); critic Ted Alvarez wrote,\n\n:Sardy's distended poetry often has a dark humor about it; lines like \"I opened\nall your mail\" (\"Feed Me\") and \"I got a game/it won't take long/we'll list all\nour beatings in a cursory rhyme\" (\"How are You\") add a dash of laughter to the\noften humorless scowl across the face of hardcore music.[]\n\nIn 1986, they released an independently-recorded demo tape called BARKMARKET,\nthen in 1987 recorded 1-800-GODHOUSE on cassette 4tk. They were signed to\nPurge/Soundleague in NYC. after recording the second album Easy Listening the\nband moved to Triple X Records, who released the group's third album, Vegas\nThroat; the latter featured guest work from avant-jazz guitarist Marc Ribot.\n\nSardy has been quoted as saying he made a promise to himself that each of their\nalbums would be a progression from 4tk, to 8tk (Easy Listening), to 16tk (Vegas\nThroat), and then 24 tk (Gimmick) with a promise to go back to 4tk for the final\nalbum, the beginning of \"Visible Cow\" on the album L Ron was an attempt to keep\nthat promise.\n\n[[Vegas Throat]] attracted the interest of Rick Rubin, and Barkmarket was one of\nthe first groups signed to Rubin's American Recordings. Vegas Throat was\nreissued by American, which then issued [[Gimmick (album)|Gimmick]] and the\nLardroom EP. During this time, they released the Peacekeeper EP on the Man's\nRuin record label.\n\n[[L Ron (album)|L. Ron]] (1996) was Barkmarket's final album. Sardy's\nengineering/production work was taking precedence over his own band, and the\ngroup quietly broke up in 1997. Sardy has since become an in-demand producer\nand mixer for many heavy rock groups (e.g., System of a Down, Marilyn\nManson, Wolfmother, Helmet, Quicksand) or even pop heavyweights like Oasis\nor The Thrills.\n\nRecently Sardy has been picked as one of the top ten up and coming film\ncomposers of 2010 for his work scoring the movies 21, and Zombieland by\nComposers
