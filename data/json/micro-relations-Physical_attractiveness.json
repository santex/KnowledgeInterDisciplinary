The term often implies sexual\nattractiveness or desirability, but can also be distinct from the two; for\nexample, humans may regard the young as attractive for various reasons, but\nwithout sexual attraction. There are many factors which influence one person's\nattraction to another, with physical aspects being one of them. In many cases,\nhumans attribute positive characteristics, such as intelligence and honesty, to\nphysically attractive people without consciously realizing it.\n\nFrom research done in the United States and United Kingdom, it was found\nthat the association between intelligence and physical attractiveness is\nstronger among men than among women. In recent times,\nevolutionary psychologists have tried to answer why individuals who are more\nphysically attractive should also on average be more intelligent, and have\nput forward the notion that both general intelligence and physical\nattractiveness may be indicators of underlying genetic fitness.

Intelligence and Physical\nAttractiveness. \"Intelligence, 39\"(1), 7-14.\n\nPhysical attractiveness is a characteristic that suggests fertility and health.\nThese factors contribute to the probability of survival and reproduction for\ncontinuing life on Earth.
