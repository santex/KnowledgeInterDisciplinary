{"cursor":"67068","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In meteorology, 'precipitation' (also known as one of the classes of\n'hydrometeors', which are atmospheric water phenomena) is any product of the\ncondensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls under gravity.\nThe main forms of precipitation include drizzle (sometimes called mist -\nespecially \"Scotch mist\"), rain, sleet, snow, graupel and hail. Precipitation\noccurs when a local portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water\nvapour, so that the water condenses and \"precipitates\". Thus, fog and mist\n(except when the terms are used to mean \"drizzle\") are not precipitation but\nsuspensions, because the water vapour does not condense sufficiently to\nprecipitate. Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming\nsaturated: cooling the air or adding water vapour to the air. Generally,\nprecipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is Virga which evaporates\nbefore reaching the surface. Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce\nvia collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud. Rain drops\nrange in size from oblate, pancake-like shapes for larger drops, to small\nspheres for smaller drops. Unlike raindrops, snowflakes grow in a variety of\ndifferent shapes and patterns, determined by the temperature and humidity\ncharacteristics of the air the snowflake moves through on its way to the ground.\nWhile snow and ice pellets require temperatures close to the ground to be near\nor below freezing, hail can occur during much warmer temperature regimes due to\nthe process of its formation.\n\nMoisture overriding associated with weather fronts is an overall major method of\nprecipitation production. If enough moisture and upward motion is present,\nprecipitation falls from convective clouds such as cumulonimbus and can organize\ninto narrow rainbands. Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for\nexample due to water evaporation from lakes, lake-effect snowfall becomes a\nconcern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the\nbackside of extratropical cyclones. Lake-effect snowfall can be locally heavy.\nThundersnow is possible within a cyclone's comma head and within lake effect\nprecipitation bands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where\nupslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation. On\nthe leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air\ncaused by compressional heating. The movement of the monsoon trough, or\nintertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.\n\nPrecipitation is a major component of the water cycle, and is responsible for\ndepositing the fresh water on the planet. Approximately of water falls as\nprecipitation each year; of it over the oceans and over land. Given the Earth's surface area, that means the globally\naveraged annual precipitation is , but over land it is only . Climate\nclassification systems such as the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system use\naverage annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.\nThe urban heat island effect may lead to increased rainfall, both in amounts and\nintensity, downwind of cities. Global warming is also causing changes in the\nprecipitation pattern globally. Precipitation may occur on other celestial\nbodies, e.g. when it gets cold, Mars has precipitation which most likely takes\nthe form of ice needles, rather than rain or snow.\n","linknr":1224,"url":"Hydrometeor","recorded":1362372216,"links":121,"instances":["meteorology","agriculture","cyclone"],"pdf":["http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf","http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf","http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/Loco_workshop/Workshop_report.pdf","http://www.knmi.nl/~hurkvd/Loco_workshop/Workshop_report.pdf","http://www.cig.ensmp.fr/~iahs/redbooks/a140/iahs_140_0063.pdf","http://www.cig.ensmp.fr/~iahs/redbooks/a140/iahs_140_0063.pdf","http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/jewell/hailslsc.pdf","http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/jewell/hailslsc.pdf","http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/issues/winter04-05/Snowflake.pdf","http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/issues/winter04-05/Snowflake.pdf","http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf","http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf","https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/6445/1/ja05036.pdf","https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/6445/1/ja05036.pdf","http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf","http://cms.ce.gatech.edu/gwri/uploads/proceedings/1999/BushongJ-99.pdf","http://cms.ce.gatech.edu/gwri/uploads/proceedings/1999/BushongJ-99.pdf","http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/talite0821.pdf","http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/talite0821.pdf","http://www.actif-ec.net/Workshop2/Presentations/ACTIF_P_S1_02.pdf","http://www.actif-ec.net/Workshop2/Presentations/ACTIF_P_S1_02.pdf"],"categories":["Basic
