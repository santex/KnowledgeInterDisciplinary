{"cursor":"16927","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Apollo spacecraft' was composed of three parts designed to accomplish the\nAmerican Apollo program's goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by the end of\nthe 1960s and returning them safely to Earth. The expendable (single-use)\nspacecraft consisted of a '[[Apollo Command/Service Module|combined\nCommand/Service Module (CSM)]]' and a '[[Lunar Module|Lunar Module (LM)]]'. Two\nadditional components complemented the spacecraft stack for launch vehicle\nassembly: a '[[Launch Escape System|Launch Escape System (LES)]]' to be used\nonly in the event of a launch emergency, and a 'Spacecraft/Lunar Module Adapter\n(SLA)' designed to connect the CSM to the launch vehicle and to house the LM.\n\nThe design was based on the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous approach: two docked\nspacecraft were sent to the Moon and went into lunar orbit. While the LM\nseparated and landed, the CSM remained in orbit. After the lunar excursion, the\ntwo craft rendezvoused and docked in lunar orbit, and the CSM returned the crew\nto Earth. The Command Module was the only part of the spacecraft that returned\nwith the crew to the Earth's surface.\n\nThe LES was jettisoned during launch upon reaching the point where it was no\nlonger needed, and the SLA remained attached to the launch vehicle's upper\nstage. Two unmanned CSM's, one unmanned LM and one manned CSM were carried into\nspace by Saturn IB launch vehicles for low Earth orbit Apollo missions. Larger\nSaturn Vs launched two unmanned CSM's on high Earth orbit test flights, the CSM\non one manned lunar mission, the complete spacecraft on one manned low Earth\norbit mission and eight manned lunar missions. After conclusion of the Apollo\nprogram, four CSM's were launched on Saturn IBs for three Skylab Earth orbital\nmissions and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.\n","linknr":264,"url":"Apollo_spacecraft","recorded":1362267817,"links":47,"instances":["aeronautics","apollo","apollo","spaceflight"],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19730010176_1973010176.pdf","http://klabs.org/history/apollo_experience_reports/tn-d7083_apollo_launch_escape_propulsion.pdf","http://www.btinternet.com/~ursine/LMhandbook.pdf","http://klabs.org/history/history_docs/mit_docs/1690.pdf"],"categories":["Manned spacecraft","Apollo program hardware"],"headings":["Command/Service Module","Lunar Module (LM)","Launch Escape System (LES)","Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)","Current locations of spacecraft","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Apollo_Spacecraft_diagram.jpg/270px-Apollo_Spacecraft_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Apollo_17_Command_Module_AS17-145-22261HR.jpg/270px-Apollo_17_Command_Module_AS17-145-22261HR.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Command_Module_diagram.jpg/220px-Command_Module_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Service_Module_diagram.jpg/220px-Service_Module_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Lunar_Module_diagram.jpg/270px-Lunar_Module_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Launch_escape_system_diagram.jpg/220px-Launch_escape_system_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Apollo_Pad_Abort_Test_-2.jpg/170px-Apollo_Pad_Abort_Test_-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/ApolloSpacecraftLMAdapterDiagram.png/220px-ApolloSpacecraftLMAdapterDiagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Apollo11-03.jpg/170px-Apollo11-03.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Apollo11-04.jpg/173px-Apollo11-04.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["canard","aeronautics"],["pad_abort_test-1","apollo"],["boilerplate","spaceflight"],["pad_abort_test-2","apollo"]],"members":["canard","boilerplate"],"related":["Project_Apollo","Moon","Earth","Lunar_Orbit_Rendezvous","Spacecraft","Space_rendezvous","Saturn_IB","Saturn_V","Skylab","Apollo-Soyuz_Test_Project","North_American_Rockwell","Apollo_PGNCS","Heat_shield","Reaction_control_system","Grumman","Descent_Propulsion_System","ALSEP","Apollo_14","Lunar_Rover","Apollo_15","Apollo_16","Apollo_17","Apollo_PGNCS","Ascent_Propulsion_System","Space_rendezvous","Launch_escape_system","Lockheed_Propulsion_Company","Canard_(aeronautics)","Parachute","Apollo_abort_modes","Thiokol","Pitot_tube","Dynamic_pressure","Angle_of_attack","Solid_fuel_rocket_motor","Thrust","Pad_Abort_Test-1_(Apollo)","Boilerplate_(spaceflight)","Pad_Abort_Test-2_(Apollo)","Little_Joe_II","Apollo_5","S-IVB","Lunar_Module","Saturn_V_Instrument_Unit","S-IVB","S-IVB","Detonating_cord","Apollo_7","S-IVB","S-IVB","Lunar_Module","Saturn_V_Instrument_Unit","S-IVB"]}
