{"cursor":"12846","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Trademark dilution' is a trademark law concept giving the owner of a famous\ntrademark standing to forbid others from using that mark in a way that would\nlessen its uniqueness. In most cases, trademark dilution involves an\nunauthorized use of another's trademark on products that do not compete with,\nand have little connection with, those of the trademark owner. For example, a\nfamous trademark used by one company to refer to hair care products might be\ndiluted if another company began using a similar mark to refer to breakfast\ncereals or spark plugs. See Ty Inc. v. Perryman, 306 F.3d 509 (7th Cir.\n2002) Dilution is a basis of trademark infringement that only applies to\nfamous marks. With non-famous marks, the owner of the mark must show that the\nallegedly infringing use creates a likelihood of confusion as to the source of\nthe product or service being identified by the allegedly infringing use. With\nnon-famous marks, it is highly unlikely a likelihood of confusion will be found\nif the products or services are in unrelated markets. However, with famous\nmarks, any use by another person of the mark has the potential for confusion,\nsince a famous mark is so well known among the consuming public that people will\nassume affiliation with the owner of the mark regardless of the product or\nservice being sold under the infringing use.\n","linknr":282,"url":"Trademark_dilution","recorded":1362569066,"links":21,"instances":["law","advertising"],"pdf":["http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/scitech/volume122/documents/Simon_WEB_000.pdf"],"categories":["Trademark law|Dilution"],"headings":["Background","Requirements for protection","Blurring and tarnishment","Laws by country","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/RegisteredTM.svg/90px-RegisteredTM.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["standing","law"],["billboard","advertising"]],"members":["standing","billboard"],"related":["Trademark","Standing_(law)","Breakfast_cereal","Spark_plug","Consumer_protection","Pepsi-Cola","Billboard_(advertising)","Coca-Cola","Kleenex","Kool-Aid","Sony","ExxonMobil","Ford_Motor_Company","Frank_Zamboni","Jurisdiction","Cybersquatting","Pana,_Illinois","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit","Panavision","Trademark_Dilution_Revision_Act","Starbucks_Corporation","Second_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals","Genericized_trademark","Disparagement","Counteraction_principle"]}
