The Act followed the reforms carried out at\ncounty level under the Local Government Act 1888. The 1894 legislation\nintroduced elected councils at district and parish level.\n\nThe principal effects of the act were: *The creation a system of urban and rural\ndistricts with elected councils. These along, with the town councils of\nmunicipal boroughs created earlier in the century, formed a second tier of local\ngovernment below the existing county councils. *The establishment of elected\nparish councils in rural areas. *The reform of the boards of guardians of poor\nlaw unions.\n\nThe new district councils were based on the existing urban and rural sanitary\ndistricts. Many of the latter had lain in more than one ancient county, whereas\nthe new rural districts were to be in a single administrative county.\n\nThe act also reorganised civil parishes, so that none of them lay in more than\none district and hence didn't cross administrative boundaries.\n\nAlthough the Act made no provision to abolish the Hundreds, which had previously\nbeen the only widely used administrative unit between the parish and the county\nin size, [http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/occupati-\nons/hundredmapping/ Mapping the Hundreds of England and Wales in GIS] University\nof Cambridge Department of Geography, published 06-06-08, accessed 2011-10-\n12 the reorganisation displaced their remaining functions. Several ancient\nhundred names lived on in the names of the districts that superseded them.\n","linknr":431,"url":"Local_Government_Act_1894","recorded":1375059583,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/140px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Long_title","/wiki/Citation_of_United_Kingdom_legislation","/wiki/Henry_Hartley_Fowler,_1st_Viscount_Wolverhampton","/wiki/Royal_Assent","/wiki/Coming_into_force","/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1933","/wiki/Act_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/County_of_London","/wiki/County_council","/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1888","/wiki/Civil_parish","/wiki/Urban_district_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)","/wiki/Rural_district","/wiki/Municipal_borough","/wiki/Parish_councils_in_England","/wiki/Board_of_guardians","/wiki/Poor_law_union","/wiki/Sanitary_district","/wiki/Administrative_county","/wiki/Civil_parish","/wiki/Hundred_(county_subdivision)","#cite_note-mapping-1","#Background","#The_bill","#Passage_through_parliament","#Urban_districts","#Urban_district_councils","#Rural_districts","#Rural_district_councils","#Parishes_administered_by_a_rural_district_council_in_another_county","#Powers","#Parish_councils_and_meetings","#Powers_and_duties","#Expenditure_and_borrowing","#Rights_of_way","#Charitable_trusts","#Parish_wards","#Boundaries","#First_elections_and_.22appointed_day.22","#Amendments_1896_-_1899","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Local_Government_Act_1888","/wiki/Liberal_Unionist","/wiki/Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/President_of_the_Local_Government_Board","/wiki/Charles_Ritchie,_1st_Baron_Ritchie_of_Dundee","#cite_note-dunl-2","/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)","/wiki/John_Morley,_1st_Viscount_Morley_of_Blackburn","/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire","#cite_note-3","/wiki/John_Wodehouse,_1st_Earl_of_Kimberley","/wiki/Walworth","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Agricultural_Smallholdings_Act_1892&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_Chaplin,_1st_Viscount_Chaplin","/wiki/President_of_the_Board_of_Agriculture","#cite_note-5","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1892","#cite_note-6","/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone","/wiki/Irish_Parliamentary_Party","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Henry_Hartley_Fowler,_1st_Viscount_Wolverhampton","#cite_note-bill-8","/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Body_corporate","/wiki/Local_Government_Board","/wiki/Ex_officio","/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace","#cite_note-bill-8","/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/United_Kingdom_House_of_Commons","#cite_note-comm21mar-9","/wiki/Penny","/wiki/Pound_sterling","#cite_note-comm21mar-9","#cite_note-comm21mar-9","/wiki/Proxy_voting","#cite_note-comm21mar-9","#cite_note-comm21mar-9","/wiki/Ward_(politics)","/wiki/Church_of_England","/wiki/Walter_Long,_1st_Viscount_Long","/wiki/Sir_Charles_Dilke,_2nd_Baronet","#cite_note-2ndr-10","#cite_note-comm-11","/wiki/Leonard_Darwin","/wiki/Lichfield_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#cite_note-comm-11","#cite_note-12","/wiki/House_of_Lords","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Royal_assent","/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Local_board_of_health","/wiki/Local_board_of_health","#cite_note-lipman-15","/wiki/Urban_district_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)","#cite_note-lipman-15","/wiki/Municipal_borough","#cite_note-s21-16","/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace","#cite_note-18","/w/index.php?title=Local_Government_Act_1894&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/List_of_rural_districts_in_England_and_Wales_1894_-_1930","#cite_note-lipman-15","/wiki/Monks_Kirby_Rural_District","/wiki/Warwickshire","/wiki/Lutterworth_Rural_District","#cite_note-s24-19","/wiki/Gloucestershire","/wiki
