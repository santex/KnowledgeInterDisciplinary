It\nmay be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious\ncommunity. The term usually refers to actions which are stylized, excluding\nactions which are arbitrarily chosen by the performers.\n\nThe field of ritual studies has seen a number of conflicting definitions of the\nterm. One given by Kyriakidis (2007) is that a ritual is an outsider's or \"etic\"\ncategory for a set activity (or set of actions) which to the outsider seems\nirrational, non-contiguous, or illogical. The term can be used also by the\ninsider or \"emic\" performer as an acknowledgement that this activity can be seen\nas such by the uninitiated onlooker.\n\nA ritual may be performed on specific occasions, or at the discretion of\nindividuals or communities. It may be performed by a single individual, by a\ngroup, or by the entire community; in arbitrary places, or in places especially\nreserved for it; either in public, in private, or before specific people. A\nritual may be restricted to a certain subset of the community, and may enable or\nunderscore the passage between religious or social states.\n\nThe purposes of rituals are varied; with religious obligations or ideals,\nsatisfaction of spiritual or emotional needs of the practitioners, strengthening\nof social bonds, social and moral education, demonstration of respect or\nsubmission, stating one's affiliation, obtaining social acceptance or approval\nfor some eventâor, sometimes, just for the pleasure of the ritual itself.\n\nRituals of various kinds are a feature of almost all known human societies, past\nor present. They include not only the various worship rites and sacraments of\norganized religions and cults, but also the rites of passage of certain\nsocieties, atonement and purification rites, oaths of allegiance, dedication\nceremonies, coronations and presidential inaugurations, marriages and funerals,\nschool \"rush\" traditions and graduations, club meetings, sports events,\nHalloween parties, veterans parades, Christmas shopping and more. Many\nactivities that are ostensibly performed for concrete purposes, such as jury\ntrials, execution of criminals, and scientific symposia, are loaded with purely\nsymbolic actions prescribed by regulations or tradition, and thus partly\nritualistic in nature. Even common actions like hand-shaking and saying hello\nmay be termed rituals.\n\n\nIn psychology, the term ritual is sometimes used in a technical sense for a\nrepetitive behavior systematically used by a person to neutralize or prevent\nanxiety; it is a symptom of obsessiveâcompulsive disorder.\n","linknr":497,"url":"Ritual","recorded":1362373199,"links":54,"instances":["religion","emotion"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ritual|","Anthropology of religion","Cultural conventions"],"headings":["Ritualistic behavior in animal kingdom and early human prehistory","Ritual actions","Religious rituals","Social functions","Anthropological studies","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Ceremony.lifeguard.london.arp.jpg/250px-Ceremony.lifeguard.london.arp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Codex_Magliabechiano_%28141_cropped%29.jpg/200px-Codex_Magliabechiano_%28141_cropped%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Yamen-Sitzung.JPG/220px-Yamen-Sitzung.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cult","religion"],["reverence","emotion"]],"members":["cult","reverence"],"related":["Symbol","Tradition","Community","Religious_community","Emic_and_etic","Emic_and_etic","Worship","Sacrament","Rite_of_passage","Ritual_purification","Oaths_of_allegiance","Coronation","Halloween","Christmas","Jury_trial","Death_penalty","Academic_conference","Handshake","Hello","Psychology","Obsessive–compulsive_disorder","Joseph_Jordania","Altered_state_of_consciousness","Hominid","Collective_identity","Battle_trance","Joseph_Jordania","Why_do_People_Sing?_Music_in_Human_Evolution","Music","Singing","Dance","Food","Drink","Psychoactive_drug","Animal_sacrifice","Human_sacrifice","Ritual_suicide","Religion","Cult_(religion)","Religious_denomination","Ayahuasca","Shamanism","Urarina","Upper_Amazon","Deity","Sociology","Burial","Cultural_universals","Fraternities_and_sororities","Victor_Turner","Mary_Douglas","Biogenetic_structuralist","Émile_Durkheim","Ceremony","Civil_religion","Habituation","Liturgy","Obsessive-compulsive_disorder","Processional_walkway","Rite","Ritualization","Ritualism","Religion","Symbolic_boundaries","Collective_identity","Battle_trance","Sexual_ritual","Superstition","Myth_and_ritual","Religious_symbolism","Reverence_(emotion)","Bronisław_Malinowski","Arnold_van_Gennep","Victor_Turner","Victor_Turner","Erik_Erikson","Jonathan_Z._Smith","Frits_Staal","Roy_Rappaport","Yatromanolakis,_Dimitrios","Panagiotis_Roilos","Yatromanolakis,_Dimitrios","Panagiotis_Roilos"]}
