It can typically be visualized as a\n\"brief oscillation\" like one might see recorded by a seismograph or heart\nmonitor. Generally, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific\nproperties that make them useful for signal processing. Wavelets can be\ncombined, using a \"reverse, shift, multiply and integrate\" technique called\nconvolution, with portions of a known signal to extract information from the\nunknown signal.\n\nFor example, a wavelet could be created to have a frequency of Middle C and a\nshort duration of roughly a 32nd note. If this wavelet was to be convolved with\na signal created from the recording of a song, then the resulting signal would\nbe useful for determining when the Middle C note was being played in the song.\nMathematically, the wavelet will resonate if the unknown signal contains\ninformation of similar frequency – just as a tuning fork physically resonates\nwith sound waves of its specific tuning frequency. This concept of resonance is\nat the core of many practical applications of wavelet theory.\n\nAs a mathematical tool, wavelets can be used to extract information from many\ndifferent kinds of data, including – but certainly not limited to – audio\nsignals and images. Sets of wavelets are generally needed to analyze data fully.\nA set of \"complementary\" wavelets will decompose data without gaps or overlap so\nthat the decomposition process is mathematically reversible. Thus, sets of\ncomplementary wavelets are useful in wavelet based compression/decompression\nalgorithms where it is desirable to recover the original information with\nminimal loss.\n\nIn formal terms, this representation is a wavelet series representation of a square-\nintegrable function with respect to either a complete, orthonormal set of basis\nfunctions, or an overcomplete set or frame of a vector space, for the Hilbert\nspace of square integrable functions.\n","title":"wavelet","headings":["Name","Wavelet theory","Mother wavelet","Comparisons with Fourier transform (continuous-time)","Definition of a wavelet","Applications of discrete wavelet transform","History","Wavelet transforms","List of wavelets","See also","Notes","References","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Continuous_wavelet_transform","4: Multiresolution_analysis","4: Discrete_wavelet_transform","3: Jean_Morlet","3: Alex_Grossman","3: Lp_space","3: Fourier_transform","3: Shannon_wavelet","3: Ingrid_Daubechies","3: Ali_Akansu","2: Signal_processing","2: Wavelet_series","2: Frame_of_a_vector_space","2: Harmonic_analysis","2: Finite_impulse_response","2: Scaleogram","2: Continuous_wavelets","2: Fast_wavelet_transform","2: Short-time_Fourier_transform","2: Fast_Fourier_transform","2: Mexican_hat_wavelet","2: Image_processing","2: Scale_space","2: JPEG_2000","2: Alfréd_Haar","2: George_Zweig","2: Haar_wavelet","2: Stéphane_Mallat","2: Wavelet_packet_decomposition","2: Stationary_wavelet_transform","2: Fractional_Fourier_transform","2: Fractional_wavelet_transform","2: Chirplet_transform","1: Wave","1: Oscillation","1: Amplitude","1: Seismograph","1: Heart_monitor","1: Convolution","1: Middle_C","1: 32nd_note","1: Square-integrable_function","1: Complete_space","1: Orthonormal","1: Basis_function","1: Completeness","1: Hilbert_space","1: French_language","1: Time-frequency_representation","1: Continuous-time","1: Discrete-time","1: Filterbank","1: Infinite_impulse_response","1: Fourier_uncertainty_principle","1: Function_space","1: Sinc_function","1: Affine","1: Frame_of_a_vector_space#Tight_frames","1: Daubechies_wavelets","1: Sampling_theorem","1: Refinable_function","1: Wavelet_set","1: Lebesgue_integration","1: Integrable_function","1: Frequency","1: Complexity","1: Big_O_notation","1: Compact_support","1: Biorthogonal_system","1: Quadrature_mirror_filter","1: Data_compression","1: Signal_analysis","1: Fourier_Transform","1: Molecular_dynamics","1: Ab_initio","1: Astrophysics","1: Density_matrix","1: Seismology","1: Optics","1: Turbulence","1: Quantum_mechanics","1: ECG","1: Neural_oscillation","1: DNA","1: Protein","1: Climatology","1: Speech_recognition","1: Computer_graphics","1: Multifractal_analysis","1: Computer_vision","1: Wavelet_compression","1: OFDM","1: Power_line_communication","1: Panasonic","1: IEEE_1901","1: Dennis_Gabor","1: Gabor_atom","1: Stephane_Mallat","1: Binomial_QMF","1: Harmonic_wavelet_transform","1: Yves_Meyer","1: Ronald_Coifman","1: Victor_Wickerhauser","1: Continuous_signal","1: Periodic_function","1: Stationary_process","1: List_of_wavelet-related_transforms","1: Lifting_scheme","1: Generalized_lifting","1: Heisenberg_group","1: Darkfield_microscope","1: Reciprocal_space","1: Crystal","1: Crystal_defect","1: Transmission_electron_microscope","1: Nanostructure","1: Pattern_recognition","1: Metrology","1: Emmanuel_Candès","1: David_Donoho","1: Beylkin","1: BNC_wavelets","1: Coiflet","1: Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau_wavelet","1: Daubechies_wavelet","1: Binomial-QMF","1: Mathieu_wavelet","1: Legendre_wavelet","1: Villasenor_wavelet","1: Symlet","1: Beta_wavelet","1: Hermitian_wavelet","1: Hermitian_hat_wavelet","1: Meyer_wavelet","1: Complex_Mexican_hat_wavelet","1: Fbsp_wavelet","1: Morlet_wavelet","1: Modified_Morlet_wavelet","1: Curvelet","1: Digital_cinema","1: Filter_bank","1: Fractal_compression","1: Noiselet","1: Shearlet","1: Ultra_wideband","1: Wave_packet","1: Gabor_wavelet#Wavelet_space","1: Dimension_reduction","1: Fourier-related_transforms","1: Spectrogram","1: Institute_of_Physics","1: Tony_F._Chan","1: Framelet"]}
