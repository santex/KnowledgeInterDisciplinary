{"cursor":"2193","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Centre for Curating the Archive', at the University of Cape Town, began\nlife as LLAREC (The Lucy Lloyd Archive, Resource and Exhibition Centre) in the\nlate 1990s as a space in which material, both original and reproduced, created\nand found, was collected from a variety of archives, museums, collections,\nstorerooms, offices and junk heaps and used creatively to curate exhibitions by\nartist-staff at the Michaelis School of Fine Art. In 2008 it expanded its\nactivities to include a photographic unit, and it is now a centre which actively\nworks with many different kinds of collections, developing curatorship as a\ncreative site of knowledge. Projects, publications and courses aim, through\npractice, to open up novel combinations of the historically separated domains of\nthe creative arts and the truth-claiming discourses of history and the social\nand natural sciences.\n\nThe CCA is located in the Old Medical School Building on the Hiddingh Campus in\nthe city of Cape Town. It neighbours the Iziko South African Museum and South\nAfrican National Gallery, the Company Gardens of Cape Town, the Labia Cinema and\nthe Drama Department of UCT. The CCA includes spaces for conservation, digital\nworkstations, photographic reproduction, storage, documentation, the planning\nand constructing of exhibitions, research and teaching.\n\nFundamental to the work of the CCA is the recognised need to both conserve and\nmake collections accessible to artists, scholars and students. This is achieved\nthrough careful curatorship and high-quality digital documentation of\ncollections; developing web-access, publications and the staging of exhibitions\nand public events. At the heart of the Centre is the understanding of\ncollections and archives as important sites of knowledge, as products of\ntraditions of art, ideas and values, as well as of the social and political\ncircumstances of both their making and reception. The CCA works with several\ninstitutions in the realisation of its projects and curates exhibitions both in\nSouth Africa and abroad.\n","linknr":79,"url":"Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","recorded":1363540558,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/University_of_Cape_Town","/wiki/Iziko_South_African_Museum","/wiki/South_African_National_Gallery","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit&section=1","http://www.cca.uct.ac.za/","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&oldid=401520169","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:University_of_Cape_Town","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_December_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive","/wiki/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/wiki/Talk:Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","#","/wiki/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&oldid=401520169","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&id=401520169","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Centre+for+Curating+the+Archive&oldid=401520169&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Curating_the_Archive","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["University
