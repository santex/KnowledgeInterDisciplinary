{"cursor":"30126","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn the physical sciences, a 'partition'- or 'distribution-coefficient' is the\nratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible phases at\nequilibrium. These coefficients are a measure of the difference in solubility of\nthe compound in these two phases.\n\nIn the chemical and pharmaceutical sciences, the two phases are often restricted\nto mean two immiscible solvents. In this context, a partition coefficient is the\nratio of concentrations of a compound in the two phases of a mixture of two\nimmiscible liquids at equilibrium. Normally one of the\nsolvents chosen is water while the second is hydrophobic such as octanol. Hence both the partition and distribution coefficient are\nmeasures of how hydrophilic (\"water-loving\") or hydrophobic (\"water-fearing\") a\nchemical substance is. In medical practice, partition coefficients are useful\nfor example in estimating distribution of drugs within the body. Hydrophobic\ndrugs with high octanol/water partition coefficients are preferentially\ndistributed to hydrophobic compartments such as lipid bilayers of cells while\nhydrophilic drugs (low octanol/water partition coefficients) preferentially are\nfound in hydrophilic compartments such as blood serum.\n\nIf one of the solvents is a gas and the other a liquid, the \"gas/liquid\npartition coefficient\" is the same as the dimensionless form of the Henry's law\nconstant. For example, the blood/gas partition coefficient of a general\nanesthetic measures how easily the anesthetic passes from gas to blood.\nPartition coefficients can also be used when one or both solvents is a solid\n(see solid solution).\n\nThe phrase \"partition coefficient\" is now considered obsolete by IUPAC, and\n\"partition constant\", \"partition ratio\", or \"distribution ratio\" are all more\nappropriate terms that should be used.\n","linknr":523,"url":"Partition_coefficient","recorded":1362479215,"links":25,"instances":["biochemistry","matter","pharmacokinetics","pharmacology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Equilibrium chemistry","Medicinal chemistry","Solvents"],"headings":["Partition coefficient and log P","Distribution coefficient and log D","Applications","Measurement","Prediction","Some Octanol-Water partition coefficient data","Limitations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/b/d/dbdb5239096e1fed7d48156ab893bcfc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/6/5/f65b3faca7c35cb8d22655ffcee607d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Separatory_funnel.jpg/220px-Separatory_funnel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/d/2/1d271a15d9e5bfcea818b489906b44c7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/0/b/70b14db31996c707a40236716853f0c9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/1/d/71da315dde1e2d4e2fc318b695665751.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/4/7/a47ea05c42163f72a4fc840a8a4fcea2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/0/9809ed098a9874556ab39a8ce9a5bb4b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["distribution","pharmacology"],["absorption","pharmacokinetics"],["distribution","pharmacology"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","phase","absorption","distribution"],"related":["Physical_sciences","Concentration","Chemical_compound","Immiscible","Phase_(matter)","Partition_equilibrium","Solubility","Chemistry","Pharmaceutical_sciences","Solvent","Water","Hydrophobic","Octanol","Hydrophilic","Hydrophobic","Distribution_(pharmacology)","Lipid_bilayers","Blood_plasma","Henry's_law","Blood/gas_partition_coefficient","General_anesthetic","Solid","Solid_solution","IUPAC","Ionization","PH","Logarithm","Concentration","Solution","Lipophilicity","Buffer_solution","Medicinal_chemistry","Druglikeness","Lipophilic_efficiency","Lipophilic_efficiency","IC50","EC50","Pharmacokinetics","ADME","Absorption_(pharmacokinetics)","Distribution_(pharmacology)","Metabolism","Excretion","Druglikeness","Lipid_bilayer","Epithelium","Transcellular","Pharmacodynamics","Hydrophobic_effect","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Intracellular","Metallurgy","Zone_melting","Directional_solidification","Scheil_equation","Hydrogeology","UV/VIS_spectroscopy","UV/VIS_spectroscopy","Carrier_free","Radiotracer","Metals","Radioactive","Chemical_equilibrium","Germanium","ICP-MS","ICP-AES","Gamma_spectroscopy","Correlation","Retention_time","Chemical_structure","Linear_regression","Parameter","ITIES","Ecole_Polytechnique_Fédérale_de_Lausanne","Quantitative_structure-activity_relationship","Parametric_model","Least_squares","Estimation_theory","Training_set","Group_contribution_method","Hammett_equation","Inductive_effect","Steric_effects","Data_mining","Support_vector_machine","Decision_tree_learning","Neural_networks","Molecule_mining","Maximum_common_subgraph_isomorphism_problem","Molecule_mining","Hammett_equation","Dortmund_Data_Bank","Acetamide","Methanol","Formic_acid","Diethyl_ether","P-Dichlorobenzene","Hexamethylbenzene","2,2',4,4',5-Pentachlorobiphenyl","Lipophilicity","Ionization","Drug_discovery","Drug","PH","Distribution_coefficient","Cheminformatics","ADME","Lipinski_Rule_of_5","Druglikeness","Lipophilic_Efficiency","QSAR","Distribution_law","ITIES","Ionic_partition_diagram","Chemicalize.org","Chemistry_Development_Kit","JOELib","Simulations_Plus","ChemAxon","Rule_of_Five","Molinspiration"]}
