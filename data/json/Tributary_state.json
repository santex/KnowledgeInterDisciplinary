{"cursor":"6528","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, a form of tribute sent to the King of Siam from its vassal states in the Malay\nPeninsula ]]\n\nThe term 'tributary state' refers to one of the two main ways in which a pre-\nmodern state might be subordinate to a more powerful\nstate. [http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=20.] Asiatic, Tributary, or Absolutist\nInternational Socialism, Nov. 2004 The heart of the relationship was that\nthe tributary would send a regular token of submission ('[[tribute]]') to the\nsuperior power. This token often took the form of a substantial transfer of\nwealth, such as the delivery of gold, produce, or slaves, so that tribute might\nbest be seen as the payment of protection money. Or it might be more symbolic:\nsometimes it amounted to no more than the delivery of a mark of submission such\nas the bunga mas (golden flower) that rulers in the Malay peninsula used to send\nto the kings of Siam. It might also involve attendance by the subordinate ruler\nat the court of the hegemon in order to make a public show of submission.\n\nTributary relations involve no element of administrative control or interference\nby the hegemon. At most, the hegemonic power might intervene in succession\nissues and might ratify the accession of a monarch. For this reason, the\nextrapolation from pre-modern inter-state relations to the modern international\nsystem is problematic. The modern-day heirs of tribute hegemons tend to claim\nthat the tributary relationship should be understood as an acknowledgement of\nthe hegemon's sovereignty in the modern world, whereas former tributary states\ndeny that there was any transfer of sovereignty. For instance, Tributaries of\nImperial China implies Chinese sovereign claim over territories not now regarded\nas Chinese.\n\nAn unusually elaborate and formalized tribute system developed in East Asia.\nHistorically, the Emperor of China saw himself as the emperor of the entire\ncivilized world. It was not possible for such an emperor to have equal\ndiplomatic relations with any other power, and so all diplomatic relations in\nthe region were construed by the Chinese as tributary. The disdain of the state\nideology of Confucianism for trade, and the conceit that Chinese civilization\nhad no need of products or technology from outside meant that trade, when it was\npermitted, was also construed as tributary. Diplomatic missions and trading\nparties from non-Chinese regions were interpreted in Chinese records as being\ntributary, regardless of the intention of those regions. Under this\nconstruction, the goods received by China constituted a tributary offering,\nwhile those that the visitors received were interpreted as gifts that the\nemperor in his kindness had bestowed upon his distant tributaries.\n\nIn Al Andalus, the last remaining Moorish Nasrid Dynasty in the Emirate of\nGranada paid tribute to the Christian Kingdom of Castile (present day Spain). In\nthe Western colonial system, non-Western states were sometimes incorporated into\na European empire as protectorates.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Datus of the Barangays became vassals of the Spanish\nEmpire, from the late 1500s until the Archipelago fell under the power of the\nUnited States of America in 1898. Their right to rule was recognized by King\nPhilip II of Spain, on 11 June 1594, under the condition of paying tributes due\nto the Spanish Crown. The King further ordered that the natives should pay\nto these nobles the same respect that the inhabitants accorded to their local\nLords before the conquest, without prejudice to the things that pertain to the\nking himself or to the encomenderos (trusteeship leaders). The royal decree\nsays: âIt is not right that the Indian Principales of the Philippines be in a\nworse condition after conversion; rather they should have such treatment that\nwould gain their affection and keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual\nblessings that God has communicated to them by calling them to his true\nknowledge, the temporal blessings may be added, and they may live contentedly\nand comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands to show them\ngood treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the government of the\nIndians, of whom they were formerly Lords. In all else the governors shall see\nthat the Principales are benefited justly, and the Indians shall pay them\nsomething as a recognition, as they did during the period of their paganism,\nprovided it be without prejudice to the tributes that are to be paid us, or\nprejudicial to that which pertains to their Encomenderos.â Felipe II, Ley de\nJunio 11, 1594 in RecapilaciÃ³n de leyes, lib. vi, tit. VII, ley xvi. The English\ntranslation of the law by Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson can be\nfound in The Philippine Islands (1493-1898), Cleveland: The A.H. Clark Company,\n1903, Vol. XVI, pp. 155-156. The original text in Spanish (RecapilaciÃ³n de\nleyes) says: No es justo, que los Indios Principales de Filipinas sean de peor\ncondiciÃ³n, despuÃ©s de haberse convertido, Ã¡ntes de les debe hacer tratamiento,\nque los aficione, y mantenga en felicidad, para que con los bienes espirituales,\nque Dios les ha comunicado llamÃ¡ndolos a su verdadero conocimiento, se junten\nlos temporales, y vivan con gusto y conveniencia. Por lo qua mandamos a los\nGobernadores de aquellas Islas, que les hagan buen tratamiento, y encomienden en\nnuestro nombre el gobierno de los Indios, de que eran SeÃ±ores, y en todo lo\ndemÃ¡s procuren, que justamente se aprovechen haciÃ©ndoles los Indios algÃºn\nreconocimiento en la forma que corrÃ­a el tiempo de su Gentilidad, con que esto\nsin perjuicio de los tributos, que Ã¡ Nos han de pagar, ni de lo que Ã¡ sus\nEncomenderos. Juan de Ariztia, ed., RecapilaciÃ³n de leyes, Madrid (1723), lib.\nvi, tit. VII, ley xvi. This reference can be found at the library of the Estudio\nTeologico Agustiniano de Valladolid in Spain.\n\nFor modern forms of state subordination, see puppet state, satellite state and\nclient
