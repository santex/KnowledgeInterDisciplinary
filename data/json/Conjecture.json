Karl Popper pioneered the use\nof the term \"conjecture\" in scientific philosophy. Conjecture is\ncontrasted by hypothesis (hence [[theory]], [[axiom]], [[principle]]), which is\na testable statement based on accepted grounds. In mathematics, a conjecture is\nan unproven proposition that appears correct. Schwartz JL (1995).
