{"cursor":"80969","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":447,"url":"Confirmation_bias","article":"'Confirmation bias' (also called 'confirmatory bias' or 'myside bias') is a\ntendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or\nhypotheses. David Perkins, a geneticist, coined the term\n\"myside bias\" referring to a preference for \"my\" side of an issue.  People display this bias when they gather or remember\ninformation selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect\nis stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.\nFor example, in reading about current political issues, people usually prefer\nsources that affirm their existing attitudes. They also tend to interpret\nambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search,\ninterpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization\n(when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are\nexposed to the same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after\nthe evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a\ngreater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and illusory\ncorrelation (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or\nsituations).\n\nA series of experiments in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward\nconfirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a\ntendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and\nignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people's\nconclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and\nthe limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that\npeople show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being\nwrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.\n\nConfirmation biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can\nmaintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor\ndecisions due to these biases have been found in military, political, and\norganizational contexts.\n","recorded":1362123837,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"448","instances":["geneticist","epidemiology","fallacy","mood","statistics","emotion","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.stats.org.uk/statistical-inference/KlaymanHa1987.pdf","http://www.stats.org.uk/statistical-inference/KlaymanHa1987.pdf","http://psychsystems.net/lab/06_Westen_fmri.pdf","http://psychsystems.net/lab/06_Westen_fmri.pdf","http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/nyhan-reifler.pdf","http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/nyhan-reifler.pdf","http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Dawson.Gilo.Regan.pdf","http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Dawson.Gilo.Regan.pdf","http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/MacCoun_AnnualReview98.pdf","http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/MacCoun_AnnualReview98.pdf","http://web.mac.com/kstanovich/Site/YUP_Reviews_files/TICS_review.pdf"],"categories":["Bias","Cognitive
