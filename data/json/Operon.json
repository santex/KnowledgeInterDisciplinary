{"cursor":"14340","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn genetics, an 'operon' is a functioning unit of genomic DNA containing a\ncluster of genes under the control of a single regulatory signal or\npromoter. The genes are transcribed\ntogether into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or\nundergo trans-splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated\nseparately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product.\nThe result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either\nexpressed together or not at all. Several genes must be both co-transcribed and\nco-regulated to define an operon. {{cite book | last1=Lodish | first1=Harvey\n| last2=Zipursky | first2=Lawrence | last3=Matsudaira | first3=Paul |\nlast4=Baltimore | first4=David | last5=Darnel | first5=James | title=Molecular\nCell Biology | publisher=W.

In general, expression of prokaryotic\noperons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons\nlead to monocistronic mRNAs. Operons have also been found in viruses such as\nbacteriophages. For example, T7 phages have two\noperonsâthe first one codes for various products including a special T7 RNA\npolymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operonâwhich includes a\nlysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.\n","linknr":466,"url":"Operon","recorded":1362373900,"links":54,"instances":["genetics","biology","genetics","genetics","biology","genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/courses/landmark/JacobMonod1960.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/courses/landmark/JacobMonod1960.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/courses/landmark/JacobMonod1960.pdf","http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/courses/landmark/JacobMonod1960.pdf"],"categories":["Gene expression"],"headings":["History","Overview","As a unit of transcription","General structure of an operon","Regulation","The ''lac'' operon","The ''trp'' operon","Predicting the number and organization of operons","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Operon_1.png/350px-Operon_1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Lac_Operon.svg/300px-Lac_Operon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["operator","biology"],["corepressor","genetics"],["activator","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["operator","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["terminator","genetics"],["operator","biology"],["attenuator","genetics"],["corepressor","genetics"]],"members":["transcription","operator","terminator","activator","promoter","translation","attenuator","corepressor"],"related":["Genetics","Gene","Promoter_(biology)","Transcription_(genetics)","MRNA","Translation_(genetics)","Trans-splicing","Monocistronic","Gene_expression","Prokaryotes","Eukaryotes","Bacteriophages","T7_phages","T7_RNA_polymerase","Lysis","French_Academy_of_Science","Repressor","Lac_operon","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_and_Medicine","François_Jacob","André_Michel_Lwoff","Jacques_Monod","Prokaryote","Eukaryote","Nematode","Caenorhabditis_elegans","Drosophila","Chordate","Structural_gene","Promoter_(biology)","Operator_(biology)","Repressor","Corepressor_(genetics)","Activator_(genetics)","Regulon","Stimulon","Modulon","Structural_gene","Polycistronic","MRNA","Protein","Promoter_(biology)","RNA_polymerase","Promoter_(biology)","Nucleotide","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase","Operator_(biology)","DNA","Lac_operon","Structural_gene","Regulatory_gene","Repressor_proteins","Gene_regulation","Repressor","Inducer","Regulator_gene","Activator_protein","Inducer","Reaction_inhibitor","Model_organism","Structural_gene","Promoter_(biology)","Terminator_(genetics)","Operator_(biology)","Glucose","Lactose","Derepression","Jacques_Monod","Allolactose","Tryptophan_synthetase","Attenuator_(genetics)","Corepressor_(genetics)","Pascale_Cossart","Gene_regulatory_network","TATA_box","L-arabinose_operon","Protein_biosynthesis","Genetic_code"]}
