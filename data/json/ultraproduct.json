An\nultraproduct is a quotient of the direct product of a family of structures. All\nfactors need to have the same signature. The 'ultrapower' is the special case of\nthis construction in which all factors are equal.\n\nFor example, ultrapowers can be used to construct new fields from given\nones. The hyperreal numbers, an ultrapower of the real numbers, are a\nspecial case of this.\n\nSome striking applications of ultraproducts include very elegant proofs of the\ncompactness theorem and the completeness theorem, Keisler's ultrapower theorem,\nwhich gives an algebraic characterization of the semantic notion of elementary\nequivalence, and the Robinson-Zakon presentation of the use of superstructures\nand their monomorphisms to construct nonstandard models of analysis, leading to\nthe growth of the area of non-standard analysis, which was pioneered (as an\napplication of the compactness theorem) by Abraham Robinson.\n","title":"ultraproduct","headings":["Definition","Examples","Łoś's theorem","Ultralimit","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Model_theory","2: Hyperreal_numbers","2: Real_numbers","1: Mathematics","1: Abstract_algebra","1: Mathematical_logic","1: Compactness_theorem","1: Completeness_theorem","1: H._Jerome_Keisler","1: Non-standard_analysis","1: Abraham_Robinson","1: Ultrafilter","1: Cofinite","1: Principal_ultrafilter","1: Cartesian_product","1: Equivalence_relation","1: Quotient_set","1: Almost_everywhere","1: Ordered_field","1: Nonstandard_integer","1: Nonstandard_complex_numbers","1: Large_cardinal","1: Measurable_cardinal","1: Jerzy_ÅoÅ","1: First-order_predicate_calculus","1: A^1],_\\ldots,_[a^n","1: Axiom_of_choice","1: Transfer_principle","1: Hyperreal_number","1: Archimedean_property","1: Set_theory","1: Direct_limit"]}
