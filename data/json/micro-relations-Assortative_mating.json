{"cursor":"7894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Assortative mating' is a nonrandom mating pattern where individuals with\nsimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than\nwhat would be expected under a random mating pattern. For example, it is common\nfor individuals of similar body size to mate with one another. MacDougall\nA.K., Montgomerie, R. (2003). Assortative mating by carotenoid-based plumage\ncolour: a quality indicator in American goldfinches, Carduelis tristis.\nNaturwissenschafte, (90): 464. Less commonly, in negative assortative\nmating, individuals with diverse traits mate more frequently than what would be\nexpected in random mating. Both cases cause the frequency of certain genotypes\nto differ greatly from the frequencies predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg\nPrinciple, which states that allele and genotype frequencies should remain\nconstant under a random mating system. Assortative mating does not change the\nfrequency of individual alleles, but increases the proportion of homozygous\nindividuals. By contrast, disassortative mating results in a greater number of\nheterozygotes. Raven,P., Johnson, G.B., Mason, K.A., Losos, J.B., Singer,\nS.S. (Eds.) (2011). Biology (9th ed.).
