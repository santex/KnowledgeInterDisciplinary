{"cursor":"3291","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Prasanna Jayakody' (born 1968) is a budding Sri Lankan film\ndirector. His debut film Sankara (Introspection), won The Special\nJury Prize The Silver Pyramid at the Cairo International Film Festival 2006 and\nthe Best Debut Director Award at the International Film Festival of Kerala\n2006.\n\nPrasanna Jayakody was born in 1968 to an artistic family which was strongly\nrooted in traditional Sinhala values and grew up in a Buddhist environment. He\ndebuted at the age of 21, with Seveneli saha Minissu (Shadows and Men) a stage\ndrama thematically woven around a thoughtful discussion on the reality of life\nand was a major critical success. He was immediately catapulted into the\nlimelight, projected as the most promising among new entrants. His Teledramas\nwhich have won unprecedented number of National Television Awards are a result\nof work which is loved by the masses of Sri Lanka and honored by the\nintelligentsia. Visual allure has been his aesthetic trademark. But his great\nability to articulate the Sinhala Buddhist ethos is the hallmark of his\nremarkable career. In this he remains unparalleled among his contemporaries. His\nmaiden cinematic creation Sankara (Introspection) is a deep analytical study of\nmans inner soul. Just as all his other artistic works, Sankara too is inspired\nby and deeply entrenched in Buddhist philosophy. Text: Satyajit Maitipe\n\n'Sankara' ':A poem that moves'\n\nA young Buddhist monk, arrives at a temple in order to restore its paintings.\nThese paintings depict the Thelapaththa Jathakaya, a moral story where Lord\nBuddha said that a man with a big target in life must not be swayed by passion\n(keles), the five senses and especially beautiful women. One day, Ananda picks\nup a hair pin belonging to a young woman. While attempting to return this object\nto its owner, his repressed, inner feelings are awoken as Ananda develops\nsensual feelings towards this woman. Hence, the young monks inner spiritual\nworld is plunged into turmoil.Then one night, the paintings are destroyed. While\nrestoring them for the second time Ananda begins to realize that he is trapped\nin a web of his worldly desires and attachments like that depicted in the\npaintings. At the end of the film, Ananda accepts that it is his own desire\nwhich has led to the defilement of his soul. In order to rid himself of his\nattachments, Ananda takes his astral being away from physical existence.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Prasanna_Jayakody","recorded":1375086190,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Sri_Lanka","/wiki/Film_director","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Sankara_(Introspection)","/wiki/Cairo_International_Film_Festival","/wiki/International_Film_Festival_of_Kerala","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://www.sankarafilm.com/","#cite_ref-2","http://www.keralafilm.com/awards_11iffk.htm/","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=edit&section=2","http://www.sankarafilm.com/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg/30px-Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=edit","/wiki/Template:SriLanka-bio-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:SriLanka-bio-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:SriLanka-bio-stub&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&oldid=545607870","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Sri_Lankan_film_directors","/wiki/Category:1968_births","/wiki/Category:Sri_Lankan_people_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Prasanna+Jayakody&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Prasanna+Jayakody","/wiki/Prasanna_Jayakody","/wiki/Talk:Prasanna_Jayakody","#","/wiki/Prasanna_Jayakody","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Prasanna_Jayakody","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Prasanna_Jayakody","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&oldid=545607870","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7238460","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Prasanna_Jayakody&id=545607870","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Prasanna+Jayakody","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Prasanna+Jayakody&oldid=545607870&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Prasanna_Jayakody&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7238460#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasanna_Jayakody","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["introspection"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Living
