{"cursor":"29827","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n was the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit for the cycle.]]\n In baseball, 'hitting for the cycle' is the accomplishment of one batter\n hitting a single, a double, a triple, and a home run in the same\n game. Collecting the hits in that order is known as a \"natural\n cycle\". Cycles are uncommon in Major League Baseball (MLB), and have\n occurred 294 times since the first by Curry Foley in 1882. The cycle is roughly as common as a no-hitter (279\n occurrences in MLB history); it has been called \"one of\n the rarest\" and \"most difficult feats\" in baseball. Based\n on 2009 offensive levels, the probability of an average MLB player hitting for\n a cycle against an average team in a game is approximately 0.00590%; this\n corresponds to about 2.5 cycles in a 162-game season with 30 teams. {{Cite web\n  | last = Sackmann first = Jeff title = The odds of a cycle publisher = The\n  | Hardball Times date = 2010-07-01 url = http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-odds-of-a-\n  | cycle/ format = HTML accessdate = 2011-10-07 }}\n\nIn other baseball leagues, the cycle is achieved less frequently. Through\nSeptember 4, 2008, 62 players in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the top-\nlevel baseball organization in Japan, have hit for the\ncycle, the most recent being Michihiro\nOgasawara. Two players have hit for the cycle on the same day once in\nNPB history; this has occurred twice in MLB history. One NPB player has also hit\nfor the cycle in an NPB All-Star game. No player has ever hit for the cycle in\nthe MLB All-Star Game or the postseason.\n","linknr":709,"url":"Hitting_for_the_cycle","recorded":1362477318,"links":32,"instances":["baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","baseball","1900s_first_baseman","baseball","baseball","sports","baseball","1960s_outfielder","baseball","baseball","baseball","outfielder","baseball","left_fielder","baseball","baseball","baseball","outfielder","outfielder"],"pdf":["http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2011/Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf","http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2011/Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf"],"categories":["Baseball
