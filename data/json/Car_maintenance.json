{"cursor":"3512","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Auto maintenance' describes the act of inspecting or testing the condition of\ncar subsystems (e.g., engine) and servicing or replacing parts and fluids.\nRegular maintenance is critical to ensure the safety, reliability, drivability,\ncomfort and longevity of a car. During preventive maintenance, a number of parts\nare replaced to avoid major damage or for safety reasons, e.g. timing belt\nreplacement.\n\nThe actual schedule of car maintenance varies depending on the year, make, and\nmodel of a car, its driving conditions and driver behavior. Car makers\nrecommend the so-called extreme or the ideal service schedule based on impact\nparameters such as\n* number of trips and distance traveled per trip per day\n* extreme hot or cold climate conditions\n* mountainous, dusty or de-iced roads\n* heavy stop-and-go vs. long-distance cruising\n* towing a trailer or other heavy load\n\nExperienced service advisors in dealerships and independent shops recommend\nschedule intervals, which are often in between the ideal or extreme service\nschedule. They base it on the driving conditions and behavior of the car owner\nor driver.\n\nCommon car maintenance tasks include:\n* Car wash\n* check/replace the engine oil and replace oil filters\n* check/replace fuel filters\n* inspect or replace windshield wipers\n* check or refill windshield washer fluid\n* inspect tires for pressure and wear\n* Tire balancing\n* Tire rotation\n* Wheel alignment\n* check, clean or replace battery terminals and top up battery fluid\n* inspect or replace brake pads\n* check or flush brake fluid\n* check or flush transmission fluid\n* check or flush power steering fluid\n* check and flush engine coolant\n* inspect or replace spark plugs\n* inspect or replace air filter\n* inspect or replace timing belt and other belts\n* lubricate locks, latches, hinges\n* check all lights\n* tighten chassis nuts and bolts\n* check if rubber boots are cracked and need replacement\n* test electronics, e.g., Anti-lock braking system or ABS\n* read fault codes from the Engine control unit\n\nSome tasks that have equivalent service intervals are combined into one single\nservice known as a tune-up. In modern cars, where electronics control most of\nthe car's functions, the traditional tune-up doesn't apply anymore. Maintenance\njobs like a tune-up used to mean getting the engine's performance back on track.\nToday embedded software takes care of it by constantly checking thousands of\nsensor signals, compensating for worn-out spark plugs, clogged filters, etc. The\nso-called limp-home function allows driving on limited power when the engine is\nin trouble. In the old days this might have meant a breakdown.\n\nIn some countries, the completed services are recorded in a service book which\nis rubber-stamped by the service center upon completion of each service. A\ncomplete service history usually adds to the resale value of a vehicle.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Car_maintenance","recorded":1362667643,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Automobile maintenance"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Oil_Change_oil_pan_2005_gmc_suv.JPG/220px-Oil_Change_oil_pan_2005_gmc_suv.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf6/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf6/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Car","Automobile_safety","Reliability_engineering","Car_handling","Car_seat","Reliability_engineering","Timing_belt","Car_wash","Engine_oil","Oil_filter","Fuel_filter","Windshield_wiper","Tire","Tire_balance","Tire_rotation","Wheel_alignment","Starter_battery","Brake_pad","Brake_fluid","Transmission_fluid","Power_steering_fluid","Antifreeze","Spark_plug","Air_filter","Timing_belt","Anti-lock_braking_system","Engine_control_unit","Tune-up","Engine_control_unit","Auto_mechanic","Automobile_repair_shop","Italian_tuneup","Mechanical_engineering"]}
