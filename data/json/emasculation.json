Removal of the testicles alone is termed castration.\nEmasculation was a form of punishment in Medieval Europe and sometimes formed\npart of the process of being hanged, drawn and quartered.\n\nBy extension, the word has also come to mean to render a male less of a man, or\nto make a male feel less of a man by humiliation. This metaphorical usage of the\nword is much more common than the application of its literal meaning. It can\nalso mean the reduction or removal of force behind a statute or legislation, for\nexample, \"the Triennial Act was emasculated by the Cavalier Parliament\".\n\nThe removal of male (pollen) parts of a plant, largely for controlled\npollination and breeding purposes, is also called emasculation.\n",
