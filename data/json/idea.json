      "text" : "\n, one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims\nthat many of Plato's ideas were Pythagorean in origin.]] In philosophy, the term\n'idea' has been used to cover a range of concepts. Ideas are often construed as\nmental representational images; i.e., images of some object. In other contexts,\nideas are taken to be concepts, although abstract concepts do not necessarily\nappear as images.<ref name=\"Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy\">Cambridge\nDictionary of Philosophy</ref> Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a\nfundamental ontological category of being. The capacity to create and understand\nthe meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of\nhuman beings. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflex, spontaneous\nmanner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, when we talk\nabout the idea of a person or a place.\n",
