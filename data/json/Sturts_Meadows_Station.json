The Wallaces travelled to the station from Mingarie in\nSouth Australia with 25 horses and 1,400 sheep via the Barrier Range in 1864,\nsquatting at different water holes. Lack of water drove\nthem further north and they didn't return to the area until 1868 only to find\nthat Joseph Panton had moved onto the property and named it Sturts Meadows. In\n1869 the property was transferred to Abraham Wallace, but a continued lack of\nwater meant the Wallaces stayed on the move. By 1876 a well on the creek near\ntheir original camp was providing permanent water and the station was in size.\n\nWallace embarked on a trek from Sturts Meadow in January 1880 heading north to\nthe properties he had acquired leases to in the Northern Territory along the\nRoper River in 1879. On arriving in Longreach, some from Sturts, he bought 2,728\nhead of cattle and continued his journey eventually arriving in July 1881 after\ncovering a distance of about . The property was later named Elsey Station and\nWallace left the next day to return to Sturts Meadows.\n\nBy 1882 the station shore 32,000 sheep.\n\nWallace retired in 1884 and appointed a manager to run the property.\n\nSackville Kidman, the brother and business partner of Sidney Kidman, once worked\nat Sturts Meadow as the station manager until silver was discovered at the\nBarrier Range and he started a butchering business in Silverton.\nKidman acquired the property some time prior to 1924 and was making plans to\nbuild up a flock of 100,000 sheep across his properties in the area including\nSturts, Morden, Lngawirra and corona Stations.\n\nThe property was on the market again in 1928 when the trustees of the late W.H.\nWilliams put the property up for auction. The property now occupied an area of\nand was divided in 14 paddocks. A stone house with seven rooms, mens quarters\nand a ten stand shearing shed were among the improvements. The homestead well\nhad 16 tanks and could water 7,000 sheep and the land was described as being\nmade up of grasslands and salt bush country.\n\nBijerkerno Gorge, where Eight Mile Creek breaks through the Barrier Ranges, is\nsituated on the property. In 2004 the owner, Peter Beven, fenced off a section\naround the gorge as part of an effort to protect the environmentally sensitive\narea. The property has a total area of and carried 12,000 merino sheep and 400\nhead of cattle.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Sturts_Meadows_Station","recorded":1375083310,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sturts_Meadows_Station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sturts_Meadows_Station&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Australia_New_South_Wales_location_map_blank.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Australia_New_South_Wales_location_map_blank.svg/240px-Australia_New_South_Wales_location_map_blank.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/8px-Red_pog.svg.png","/wiki/Pastoral_lease","/wiki/Cattle_station","/wiki/Sheep_station","/wiki/New_South_Wales","/wiki/Broken_Hill,_New_South_Wales","/wiki/White_Cliffs,_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Charles_Sturt","#cite_note-R1-1","/wiki/Water_well","/wiki/Roper_River","/wiki/Longreach,_Queensland","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Sidney_Kidman","/wiki/Silver","/wiki/Barrier_Range","/wiki/Silverton,_New_South_Wales","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","/wiki/Trustee","/wiki/Auction","/wiki/Salt_bush","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Barrier_Range","/wiki/Merino","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Sturts_Meadows_Station&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/List_of_ranches_and_stations","/w/index.php?title=Sturts_Meadows_Station&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-R1_1-0","http://outbacknsw.com.au/UA%20Heritage%205%20Pastoral%20Oct06.pdf","#cite_ref-2","http://www.mtwilson.com.au/images/stories/PDF/Elsey_Station__the_Wallace_Collection_-_June_2003.pdf","#cite_ref-3","http://artsandmuseums.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/114963/occpaper18.pdf","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/ISBN_0_7245_0589_X","#cite_ref-4","http://ehive.com/account/3492/object/77344/Abraham_WALLACE_b_1828_Offaly_Ireland_d_27th_September_1884_Reynella_SA","#cite_ref-5","http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/kidman-sackville-15216","/wiki/Australian_National_University","#cite_ref-6","http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article102230988","/wiki/The_Recorder_(Port_Pirie)","#cite_ref-7","http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46034558","/wiki/Barrier_Miner","#cite_ref-8","http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/02/1080544687565.html","/wiki/Fairfax_Media","/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system","//tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Sturts_Meadows_Station&params=31.294_S_141.71_E_type:landmark_region:AU-NSW","/wiki/Template:Stations_of_Sidney_Kidman","/wiki/Template_talk:Stations_of_Sidney_Kidman","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Stations_of_Sidney_Kidman&action=edit","/wiki/Station_(Australian_agriculture)","/wiki/Sidney_Kidman","/wiki/Anna_Creek","/wiki/Durham_Downs_Station","/wiki/Durrie_Station","/wiki/Glengyle_Station","/wiki/Helen_Springs_Station","/wiki/Innamincka_Station","/wiki/Macumba_Station","/wiki/Morney_Plains_Station","/wiki/Nappa_Merrie","/wiki/Ruby_Plains_Station","/wiki/Alton_Downs_Station","/wiki/Arcoona","/wiki/Annandale_Station_(pastoral_lease)","/wiki/Boorara_Station","/wiki/Bulloo_Downs_Station","/wiki/Carandotta_Station","/wiki/Carlton_Hill_Station","/wiki/Caryapundy_Station","/wiki/Cowarie_Station","/wiki/Diamantina_Lakes_Station","/wiki/Fossil_Downs_Station","/wiki/Headingly_Station","/wiki/Mornington_Station","/wiki/Mundowdna_Station","/wiki/Pandie_Pandie_Station","/wiki/Quinyambie","/wiki/Tickalara","/wiki/Victoria_River_Downs_Station","/wiki/Yancannia_Station","/wiki/Yeeda_Station","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sturts_Meadows_Station&oldid=563326711","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Station_(Australian_agriculture)","/wiki/Category:Pastoral_leases_in_New_South_Wales","/wiki/Category:Use_Australian_English_from_June_2013","/wiki/Category:All_Wikipedia_articles_written_in_Australian_English","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_June_2013","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sturts+Meadows+Station&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sturts+Meadows+Station","/wiki/Sturts_Meadows_Station","/wiki/Talk:Sturts_Meadows_Station","#","/wiki/Sturts_Meadows_Station","/w/index.php?title=Sturts_Meadows_Station&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sturts_Meadows_Station&action=history","#","/w/index.
