Almost any\nbiological sample containing a full copy of the DNAâeven a very small amount of\nDNA or ancient DNAâcan provide the genetic material necessary for full genome\nsequencing. Such samples may include saliva, epithelial cells, bone marrow, hair\n(as long as the hair contains a hair follicle), seeds, plant leaves, or anything\nelse that has DNA-containing cells. Because the sequence data that is produced\ncan be quite large (for example, there are approximately six billion base pairs\nin each human diploid genome), genomic data is stored electronically and\nrequires a large amount of computing power and storage capacity. Full genome\nsequencing would have been nearly impossible before the advent of the\nmicroprocessor, computers, and the Information Age.\n\nUnlike full genome sequencing, DNA profiling only determines the likelihood that\ngenetic material came from a particular individual or group; it does not contain\nadditional information on genetic relationships, origin or susceptibility to\nspecific diseases. Kijk magazine, 01 January 2009 Also unlike full\ngenome sequencing, SNP genotyping covers less than 0.1% of the genome. Almost\nall truly complete genomes are of microbes; the term \"full genome\" is thus\nsometimes used loosely to mean \"greater than 95%\". The remainder of this article\nfocuses on nearly complete human genomes.\n\nIn general, knowing the complete DNA sequence of an individual's genome does\nnot, on its own, provide useful clinical information, but this may change over\ntime as a large number of scientific studies continue to be published detailing\nclear associations between specific genetic variants and disease.\n\nThe first nearly complete human genomes sequenced were J. Craig Venter's\n(Caucasian at 7.5-fold average coverage), James Watson's (Caucasian male at 7.4-\nfold), a Han Chinese (YH at 36-\nfold), a Yoruban from Nigeria (at 30-fold), a female\nleukemia patient (at 33 and 14-fold coverage for tumor and normal\ntissues), and Seong-Jin Kim (Korean at 29-fold). , there\nare 69 nearly complete human genomes publicly available. http://www.completegenomics.com/news-events/press-\nreleases/archive/Complete-Genomics-Adds-29-High-Coverage-Complete-Human-Genome-\nSequencing-Datasets-to-its-Public-Genomic-Repository--119298369.html Steve\nJobs also had his genome sequenced for $100,000.
