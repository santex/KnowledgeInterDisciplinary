{"cursor":"9854","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Swarming motility' is a rapid (2â10 Î¼m/s) and coordinated translocation of a\nbacterial population across solid or semi-solid surfaces. This type of motility\nis an example of an emerging concept in microbiology : bacterial\nmulticellularity. Swarming motility was first reported by Jorgen\nHenrichsen and has been mostly studied in genus\n[[Serratia]], [[Salmonella]],\n[[Aeromonas]], [[Bacillus]], Yersinia,\n[[Pseudomonas]], [[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]],\n[[Vibrio]] and [[Escherichia]].\n\nThis multicellular behavior has been mostly observed in controlled laboratory\nconditions and relies on two critical elements: 1) the nutrient composition and\n2) viscosity of culture medium (i.e. % agar). One\nparticular feature of this type of motility is the formation of dendritic fractal-\nlike patterns formed by migrating swarms moving away from an initial location.\nAlthough the majority of species can produce tendrils when swarming, some\nspecies like [[Proteus mirabilis]] do form concentric circles motif instead of\ndendritic patterns.
