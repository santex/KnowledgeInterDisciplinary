In the universe of\nThe Runelords, there exists a unique magical system which relies on the\nexistence of distinct bodily attributes, such as brawn, grace, and wit. These\nattributes can be transferred from one individual (or animal) to another in a\nprocess known as \"giving an endowment\". Lords who have taken many endowments\nbecome extremely powerful, almost superhuman, and are known as Runelords.\n","linknr":216,"url":"Spring_(Runelords)","recorded":1362575285,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fantasy books by series","Novel series","Runelords series"],"headings":["Novels of The Runelords","Legends and history","Races and groups","Countries","Characters","Magic","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/The_Sum_of_All_Men.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Wizardborn.jpg/200px-Wizardborn.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3c/The_Runelands_Brotherhood_of_the_Wolf_Cover.jpg/200px-The_Runelands_Brotherhood_of_the_Wolf_Cover.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/The_Lair_of_Bones.jpg/200px-The_Lair_of_Bones.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["magic","runelords"],["magic","runelords#endowments"]],"members":["magic"],"related":["Fantasy","Author","David_Farland","Magic_(Runelords)","Humans","Afterlife","Angel","Spirit","Spiritual_possession","Middle_Ages","History_of_the_Middle_East"]}
