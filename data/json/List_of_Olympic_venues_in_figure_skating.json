This is one of two sports in the Winter Olympics to\ndebut in the Summer Olympics with ice hockey being the other.\nThe first venue for the event took place during the 1908 Games was held\nindoors.

Accessed 21 March 2011.\nTwelve years later, the venue joined ice hockey as another Winter Olympic sport\nin the Summer Olympics. For the first two\nWinter Olympics, figure skating was held outdoors. With figure skating being held outdoors,\nthere were weather concerns with thawing for the first two Winter Games. A suggestion by International Olympic Committee President Count\nHenri de Baillet-Latour to 1932 Olympic Organizing Committee President Godfrey\nDewey in September 1930 led Dewey to create the first indoor arena for the\nWinter Olympics. For the 1936 Games, the venue was covered\npartially. Following World War II, the 1948 venue became the\nfirst venue to be used twice at the Winter Olympics since it had been used\ntwenty years earlier. Figure skating's final competition\nthat took place outdoors was in 1956 though that venue has since had a roof\nadded to it. Since 1960, all figure skating competitions\nhave taken place indoors. Three National Hockey League (NHL)\nvenues have hosted Olympic figure skating competitions: the 1988 (both venues)\nand the 2010 though the NHL Vancouver Canucks moved out of the 2010 venue\nfollowing the 1994-95 season.
