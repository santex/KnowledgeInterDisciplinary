{"cursor":"10104","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Automated reasoning' is an area of computer science and mathematical logic\ndedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. The study in\nautomated reasoning helps produce software which allows computers to reason\ncompletely, or nearly completely, automatically. Although automated reasoning is\nconsidered a sub-field of artificial intelligence it also has connections with\ntheoretical computer science and even philosophy.\n\nThe most developed subareas of automated reasoning are automated theorem proving\n(and the less automated but more pragmatic subfield of interactive theorem\nproving) and automated proof checking (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning\nunder fixed assumptions). Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by\nanalogy induction and abduction. Other important topics are reasoning under\nuncertainty and non-monotonic reasoning. An important part of the uncertainty\nfield is that of argumentation, where further constraints of minimality and\nconsistency are applied on top of the more standard automated deduction. John\nPollock's Oscar system is an example of an automated argumentation system that\nis more specific than being just an automated theorem prover.\n\nTools and techniques of automated reasoning include the classical logics and\ncalculi, fuzzy logic, Bayesian inference, reasoning with maximal entropy and a\nlarge number of less formal ad-hoc techniques.\n","linknr":260,"url":"Automated_reasoning","recorded":1362485194,"links":21,"instances":["philosophy","computer_science","programming_language"],"pdf":["http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101370p.pdf","http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/slides/tphols-18aug09/slides.pdf"],"categories":["Theoretical computer science","Automated theorem proving","Artificial intelligence","Logic in computer science","Reasoning"],"headings":["Early years","Significant contributions","Proof systems","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["induction","philosophy"],["haskell","programming_language"],["program_analysis","computer_science"]],"members":["induction","program_analysis","haskell"],"related":["Computer_science","Mathematical_logic","Reasoning","Artificial_intelligence","Theoretical_computer_science","Philosophy","Automated_theorem_proving","Interactive_theorem_proving","Automated_proof_checking","Analogy","Induction_(philosophy)","Abductive_reasoning","Uncertainty","Non-monotonic_logic","Fuzzy_logic","Bayesian_inference","Principle_of_maximum_entropy","Formal_logic","Artificial_Intelligence","Formal_proof","Axioms","Automated_deduction","Logic_Theorist","Presburger_arithmetic","AI_winter","Microsoft","Software_verification","Visual_C","Formal_logic","Alfred_North_Whitehead","Bertrand_Russell","Principles_of_Mathematics","Mathematical_expression","Symbolic_logic","Stanford_University","Allen_Newell","Cliff_Shaw","Herbert_A._Simon","Lisp","Objective_CAML","HOL_Light","Coq","Haskell_(programming_language)","Logic_Theorist","Principia_Mathematica","Circuit_design","Automated_theorem_proving","Conference_on_Automated_Deduction","Stanford_Encyclopedia","Applications_of_artificial_intelligence","Automated_theorem_proving","List_of_emerging_technologies","Outline_of_artificial_intelligence","Program_analysis_(computer_science)","International_Joint_Conference_on_Automated_Reasoning","Conference_on_Automated_Deduction","International_Conference_on_Automated_Reasoning_with_Analytic_Tableaux_and_Related_Methods","Journal_of_Automated_Reasoning","Association_for_Automated_Reasoning"]}
