{"cursor":"16892","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Apollo_15_launch.ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":" on a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft.]] 'Aeronautics' (from Greek á½°Î®Ï ÄÄr which means\n \"air\" and Î½Î±ÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® nautikÄ which means \"navigation, Airmanship\", i.e.\n \"navigation of the air\") is the science involved with the study, design, and\n manufacturing of airflight-capable machines, or the techniques of operating\n aircraft and rocketry within the atmosphere. While the termâliterally meaning\n \"sailing the air\"âoriginally referred solely to the science of operating the\n aircraft,it has since been expanded to include technology, business and other\n aspects related to aircraft. {{cite encyclopedia\n | title = Aeronautics encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana volume = 1 pages =\n | 226 year = 1986 publisher = Grolier }}\n\nOne of the significant parts in aeronautics is a branch of physical science\ncalled aerodynamics, which deals with the motion of air and the way that it\ninteracts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft. The term \"aviation\" is\nsometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although \"aeronautics\" includes\nlighter-than-air craft such as airships, and includes ballistic vehicles while\n\"aviation\" does not.\n","linknr":376,"url":"Aeronautics","recorded":1362267767,"links":75,"instances":["force","airship","aviation_inventor","physics","aircraft","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aeronautics|"],"headings":["Early aeronautics","Early aviation research","Early aviation","Modern aviation","Rocketry","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Atlantis_on_Shuttle_Carrier_Aircraft.jpg/220px-Atlantis_on_Shuttle_Carrier_Aircraft.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Flying_boat.png/100px-Flying_boat.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/First_flight2.jpg/220px-First_flight2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Hindenburg_at_lakehurst.jpg/220px-Hindenburg_at_lakehurst.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Helios_cthomas.jpg/220px-Helios_cthomas.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Typhoon_f2_zj910_arp.jpg/220px-Typhoon_f2_zj910_arp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/An-225_Mriya.jpg/220px-An-225_Mriya.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lift","force"],["drag","physics"],["david_schwarz","aviation_inventor"],["hindenburg","airship"],["reaction","physics"],["flap","aircraft"]],"members":["lift","hindenburg","david_schwarz","drag","flap","reaction"],"related":["Shuttle_Carrier_Aircraft","Greek_language","Science","Flight","Aircraft","Rocketry","Physical_science","Aerodynamics","Air","Aviation","Airship","Icarus","Daedalus","Ibn_Firnas","Córdoba,_Spain","Al-Andalus","Roger_Bacon","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Ornithopter","Sir_George_Cayley","Aeronautical_engineering","Lift_(force)","Drag_(physics)","Francesco_Lana_de_Terzi","Jesuit","Brescia","Lombardy","Vacuum_airship","Archimedes","Euclid","Robert_Boyle","Otto_von_Guericke","Boomerang","Australia","Kongming_lantern","Kite","Icarus","Jamshid","Archytas","Taranto","Abbas_Ibn_Firnas","Eilmer_of_Malmesbury","Passarola","Bartholomeu_Lourenço_de_Gusmão","Hot_air_balloon","Montgolfier_brothers","Airship","Jean-Pierre_Blanchard","Sir_George_Cayley","Henri_Giffard","David_Schwarz_(aviation_inventor)","Alberto_Santos-Dumont","Early_flying_machines","Aileron","World_War_I","Non-rigid_airship","Rigid_airship","Zeppelin","Lakehurst_Naval_Air_Station","LZ_127_Graf_Zeppelin","Hindenburg_(airship)","Charles_Lindbergh","Charles_Kingsford_Smith","Douglas_DC-3","Airliner","World_War_II","Turbojet","Rocket","Helios_Prototype","Solar_power","World_War_II","North_America","General_aviation","Cessna","The_New_Piper_Aircraft","Beechcraft","De_Havilland_Comet","Boeing_707","Gas_turbine","Composite_material","Concorde","Transistor","Global_Positioning_System","Communications_satellite","Computer","Light-emitting_diode","Airliner","Synthetic_vision","Scaled_Composites_SpaceShipOne","Spaceflight","Ethanol","Electricity","Solar_energy","Rocket","Missile","Aircraft","Vehicle","Thrust","Rocket_engine","Propellant","Reaction_(physics)","China","Space_Age","Apollo_11","Fireworks","Ejection_seat","Launch_vehicle","Artificial_satellite","Human_spaceflight","Space_exploration","Escape_velocity","Chemical_rocket","Rocket_propellant","Aeronautical_abbreviations","Aerospace_engineering","Aerostat","Aileron","Air_safety","Aircraft_design","Aircraft_flight_control_system","Aircraft_flight_mechanics","American_Institute_of_Aeronautics_and_Astronautics","Astronautics","Avionics","Center_of_gravity_of_an_aircraft","Flap_(aircraft)","Flight_control_surfaces","Flight_dynamics","Kite_types","Longitudinal_static_stability","Metaplane","Spacecraft","The_Royal_Aeronautical_Society"]}
