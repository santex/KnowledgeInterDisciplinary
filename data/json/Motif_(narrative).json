Through its repetition, a motif can help produce other narrative (or\nliterary) aspects such as theme or mood. James H.

The flute in Arthur Miller's\nplay [[Death of a Salesman]] is a recurrent sound motif that conveys rural and\nidyllic notions. Another example from modern American literature is the green\nlight found in the novel [[The Great Gatsby]] by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nNarratives may include multiple motifs of varying types. In Shakespeare's play\n[[Macbeth]], he uses a variety of narrative elements to create many different\nmotifs. Imagistic references to blood and water are continually repeated. The\nphrase \"fair is foul, and foul is fair\" is echoed at many points in the play, a\ncombination that mixes the concepts of good and evil. The play also features the\ncentral motif of the washing of hands, one that combines both verbal images and\nthe movement of the actors.\n\nIn a narrative, a motif establishes a pattern of ideas that may serve different\nconceptual purposes in different works. Kurt Vonnegut, for example, in his non-\nlinear narratives such as [[Slaughterhouse-Five]] and [[Cat's Cradle]] makes\nfrequent use of motif to connect different moments that might seem otherwise\nseparated by time and space. \"Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\" Encyclopedia of World\nBiography. Thomson Gale. 2004. HighBeam Research. 26 Aug. 2010\n In the American science fiction cult classic\n[[Blade Runner]], director Ridley Scott uses motifs to not only establish a dark\nand shadowy film noir\natmosphere, [http://www.aboutfilm.com/movies/b/bladerunner.htm Blade]\nbut also to weave together the thematic complexities of the plot. Throughout the\nfilm, the recurring motif of âeyesâ is connected to a constantly changing flow\nof images, and sometimes violent manipulations, in order to call into question\nour ability, and the narrator's own, to accurately perceive and understand\nreality. Bukatman, pp. 9â11.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Motif_(narrative)","recorded":1362566378,"links":29,"instances":["literature","visual_arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Literary concepts"],"headings":["Usage","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["motif","music"],["motif","visual_arts"],["trope","literature"]],"members":["trope","motif"],"related":["Narrative","New_York_City","Abingdon,_Oxfordshire","Routledge","Arthur_Miller","F._Scott_Fitzgerald","Kurt_Vonnegut","Nonlinear_narrative","Ridley_Scott","Film_noir","Thematic_patterning","Motif_(music)","Motif_(visual_arts)","Trope_(literature)"]}
