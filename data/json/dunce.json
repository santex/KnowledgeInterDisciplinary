      "text" : "A 'dunce' is a person considered to be incapable of learning.\n\nThe word is derived from the name of the Scholastic theologian and philosopher\nJohn Duns Scotus, also referred to as Doctor Subtillis, or \"Subtle Doctor\",\nwhose works on logic, theology and philosophy were accepted textbooks in the\nuniversities from the 14th century.\n\nDuns or Dunsman was a name applied by early opponents to the followers of Duns\nScotus, who were less disparagingly called the Scotists. When, in the 16th\ncentury, the Scotists obstinately opposed the new learning (i.e., the King James\nBible), the term duns or dunce became, in the mouths of the Protestants a term\nof abuse, a synonym for one incapable of scholarship. Dunces are often\ncomedically shown wearing paper cone hats, known as dunce caps, with the word\n\"dunce\" or \"dumb\", or simply a capitalized \"D\" on them. Schoolchildren were\nsometimes compelled to wear a dunce cap and to sit on a stool in the corner as a\nform of humiliating punishment for misbehaving or for failing to demonstrate\nthat they had properly performed their studies.\n",
