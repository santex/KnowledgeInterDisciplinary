{"cursor":"2305","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'orbital plane' of an object orbiting another is the geometrical plane in\nwhich the orbit lies. The orbital plane is defined by two parameters,\nInclination (i) and Longitude of the ascending node (Î©). Three non-collinear\npoints in space suffice to determine the orbital plane. A common example would\nbe: the center of the heavier object, the center of the orbiting object and the\ncenter of the orbiting object at some later time.\n\nAll of the planets, comets, and asteroids in the Solar System are in orbit\naround the Sun. The orbital planes of all those orbits nearly line up with each\nother, making a semi-flat disk called the invariable plane of the Solar System.\n\n\nBy definition the inclination of a planet in the solar system is the angle\nbetween its orbital plane and the orbital plane of the Earth (the ecliptic). In\nother cases, for instance a moon orbiting another planet, it is convenient to\ndefine the inclination of the moon's orbit as the angle between its orbital\nplane and the planet's equator.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Orbital_plane_(astronomy)","recorded":1362268717,"links":30,"instances":["mathematics","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Orbits"],"headings":["Artificial satellites around the Earth","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Crab_Nebula.jpg/30px-Crab_Nebula.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plane","mathematics"],["line","geometry"]],"members":["plane","line"],"related":["Plane_(mathematics)","Inclination","Longitude_of_the_ascending_node","Line_(geometry)","Solar_System","Invariable_plane","Inclination","Solar_system","Angle","Earth","Ecliptic","Moon","Propellant","Orbital_period","Orbital_eccentricity","Earth's_gravity","Sun","Sun-synchronous_orbit","Launch_window","Orbital_elements"]}
