On average,\nseawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, or 599 mM).\nThis means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has\napproximately of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium () and chloride () ions).\nAverage density at the surface is 1.025 g/ml. Seawater is denser than both fresh\nwater and pure water (density 1.0 g/ml @ ) because the dissolved salts add mass\nwithout contributing significantly to the volume. The freezing point of seawater\ndecreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity it freezes at\nabout . The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in\n2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured .\n","linknr":607,"url":"Seawater","recorded":1362481556,"links":67,"instances":["element","kitchen","shipboard","traveller","meteorology","marine"],"pdf":["http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/Thermophysical_properties_of_seawater-DWT-16-354-2010.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/Thermophysical_properties_of_seawater-DWT-16-354-2010.pdf","http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_4/issue_2/0128.pdf","http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ftp/cdiac74/chapter5.pdf","http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ftp/cdiac74/chapter5.pdf","http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/harshEnv2/HE2ch29.pdf","http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/harshEnv2/HE2ch29.pdf"],"categories":["Aquatic ecology","Chemical oceanography","Liquid water","Physical oceanography"],"headings":["Geochemistry","Compositional differences from freshwater","Microbial components","Origin","Human consumption","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Sea_water_Virgo.jpg/220px-Sea_water_Virgo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png/220px-WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Water_salinity_diagram.png/250px-Water_salinity_diagram.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Sea_salt-e-dp_hg.svg/220px-Sea_salt-e-dp_hg.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Upwelling.svg/140px-Upwelling.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png/140px-Antarctic_bottom_water_hg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["mercury","element"],["lifeboat","shipboard"],["william_willis","traveller"],["evaporator","marine"],["galley","kitchen"]],"members":["mercury","galley","lifeboat","william_willis","precipitation","evaporator"],"related":["Water","Sea","Ocean","Salinity","Molar_concentration","Sea_salt","Sodium","Chloride","Ions","Gram","Litre","Density","Fresh_water","Melting_point","Antarctic","World_Ocean_Atlas","Red_Sea","Evaporation","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Dead_Sea","Density","PH","Speed_of_sound","Oxygen","Sulfur","Hydrogen","Calcium","Chloride","Potassium","Sodium","Bromine","Magnesium","Carbon","Climate_change","Carbon_dioxide","Ocean_acidification","Mercury_(element)","Ion","Bicarbonate","Molar_concentration","Percentage","Ion","Residence_time","Sodium","Chlorine","Calcium","Carbonate","Magnesium","Sulfate","Scripps_Institution_of_Oceanography","Pelagic","Neritic","Thermocline","Spirilli","DNA","Census_of_Marine_Life","Marine_Biological_Laboratory","Water_column","Symbionts","Cyanobacteria","Stromatolites","Diatoms","Hydrogen_sulphide","Benguela_Current","Archaea","Hydrothermal_vents","PH","Biomass","Methane","Greenhouse","Dinoflagellates","Red_tides","Metabolites","Aberdeen_University","Atacama_Trench","New_Zealand","Antarctica","Cholera","Hepatitis_A","Hepatitis_E","Polio","Giardiasis","Cryptosporidiosis","Scientific_theory","Edmond_Halley","Water_cycle","Dead_Sea","Caspian_Sea","Endorheic_basin","Outgassing","Hydrochloric_acid","Volcano","Hydrothermal_vent","Plate_tectonics","Evaporite","Basalt","Plate_tectonics","Urine","Renal_system","Kidney","Nerve","Seizure","Heart_arrhythmia","Survival_skills","Lifeboat_(shipboard)","Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge","Alain_Bombard","Kon-Tiki","Thor_Heyerdahl","William_Willis_(traveller)","Desalination","Drinking_water","Vacuum_distillation","Multi-stage_flash_distillation","Evaporator_(marine)","Reverse_osmosis","Age_of_Sail","Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson","Galley_(kitchen)","Fish","Whale","Sea_turtle","Penguin","Gerbil","Artificial_seawater","Brine","Freshwater","Saline_water","Salinity","Sea_ice","Sea_salt","Thermohaline_circulation","CORA_dataset"]}
