{"cursor":"92449","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn cell biology, a 'mitochondrion' (plural 'mitochondria') is a membrane-\nenclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells.\nThese organelles range from 0.5 to 1.0 micrometer (Î¼m) in diameter.\nMitochondria are sometimes described as \"cellular power plants\" because they\ngenerate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a\nsource of chemical energy. In addition to supplying cellular energy,\nmitochondria are involved in other tasks such as signaling, cellular\ndifferentiation, cell death, as well as the control of the cell cycle and cell\ngrowth. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases,\nincluding mitochondrial disorders and cardiac dysfunction,\nand may play a role in the aging process. The word mitochondrion comes from the\nGreek Î¼Î¯ÏÎ¿Ï mitos, thread, + ÏÎ¿Î½Î´ÏÎ¯Î¿Î½ chondrion, granule.\n\nSeveral characteristics make mitochondria unique. The number of mitochondria in\na cell varies widely by organism and tissue type. Many cells have only a single\nmitochondrion, whereas others can contain several thousand mitochondria. The organelle is composed of\ncompartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions\ninclude the outer membrane, the intermembrane space, the inner membrane, and the\ncristae and matrix. Mitochondrial proteins vary depending on the tissue and the\nspecies. In humans, 615 distinct types of proteins have been identified from\ncardiac mitochondria, whereas in Murinae (rats), 940 proteins encoded\nby distinct genes have been reported. The mitochondrial proteome is\nthought to be dynamically regulated. Although most of a cell's DNA is\ncontained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own independent genome.\nFurther, its DNA shows substantial similarity to bacterial genomes.\n","linknr":1787,"url":"Mitochondria","recorded":1362512554,"links":106,"instances":["ubiquinone","biology","genetics","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.mbl.ku.dk/MKuhl/pages/PDF/Thar&Kuhl2004.pdf","http://www.mbl.ku.dk/MKuhl/pages/PDF/Thar&Kuhl2004.pdf","http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/110614/srep00013/pdf/srep00013.pdf","http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/110614/srep00013/pdf/srep00013.pdf","http://www.mprize.com/files/sens/polg-PP.pdf"],"categories":["Cellular
