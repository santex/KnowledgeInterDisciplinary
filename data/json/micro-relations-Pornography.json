Pornography\nmay use a variety of media, including books, magazines, postcards, photos,\nsculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, film, video, and video\ngames. The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself,\nand so does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. A\npornographic [[model (person)|model]] poses for still photographs. A\n[[pornographic film actor|pornographic actor]] or porn star performs in\npornographic films. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in porn\nfilms may be also be called a model.\n\nPornography is often distinguished from erotica, which consists of the portrayal\nof sexuality with high-art aspirations, focusing also on feelings and emotions,\nwhile pornography involves the depiction of acts in a sensational manner, with\nthe entire focus on the physical act, so as to arouse quick intense\nreactions. {{cite web |url =\nhttp://tech.mit.edu/V116/N65/erotica.65l.html |title = Erotica is Not\nPornography |author = William J.

Softcore pornography can generally be\ndescribed as focusing on nude modeling and suggestive, but not explicit,\nsimulations of sexual intercourse, whereas hardcore pornography explicitly\nshowcases penetrative intercourse.\n\nPornography has often been subject to censorship and legal restraints to\npublication on grounds of obscenity. Such grounds and even the definition of\npornography have differed in various historical, cultural, and national\ncontexts. H. Mongomery Hyde (1964) A History of Pornography: 1â26.\nWith the emergence of social attitudes more tolerant of sexuality and more\nspecific legal definitions of obscenity, an industry for the production and\nconsumption of pornography arose in the latter half of the 20th century. The\nintroduction of home video and the Internet saw booms in a worldwide porn\nindustry that generates billions of dollars annually.\n","linknr":1084,"url":"Pornography","recorded":1362486203,"links":117,"instances":["economics","manet","2003_book","economics","film_critic","business"],"pdf":["http://people.hbs.edu/bedelman/papers/redlightstates.pdf","http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jmuniz/religion_annurev_sherkat%20and%20ellison%201999.pdf","http://www.shelleylubben.com/sites/default/files/SecondaryNegativeEffectsPorn.pdf"],"categories":["Pornography|"],"headings":["Sub-genres","Economics","Technology","Production
