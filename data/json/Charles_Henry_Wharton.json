At the close of the American Revolution he resided at\nWorcester, England, as chaplain to the Roman Catholics in that city. There he\naddressed a poetical epistle to George Washington, with a sketch of his life,\nwhich was published for the benefit of American prisoners in England (Annapolis,\n1779; London, 1780).\n\nHe returned to what had become the United States in 1783 in the first vessel\nthat sailed after the peace. In May, 1784, having adopted the views of the\nChurch of England, he published his celebrated \"Letter to the Roman Catholics\nof Worcester\" (Philadelphia, 1784), and became rector of Immanuel Church, New\nCastle, Delaware. At the general convention of 1785 he was on the committee to\n\"draft an ecclesiastical constitution for the Protestant Episcopal church in\nthe United States\", also on the committee \"to prepare a form of prayer and\nthanksgiving for the Fourth of July\", and that to Americanize the [[Book of\nCommon Prayer]]. In 1786 he was elected a mere-bet of the American\nphilosophical society.\n\nAfter ten years' further residence in Delaware, he became, in 1798, rector of\nSt. Mary's Church, Burlington, New Jersey. In 1801 he accepted the presidency of\nColumbia College, New York, and was to assume the position at the August\ncommencement ceremonies, but he did not appear for them, and resigned in the\nfall.
