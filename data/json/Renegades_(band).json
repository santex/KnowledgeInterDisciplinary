{"cursor":"10132","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name =Renegades image = Renegades Camden.JPG caption = Renegades playing a\n| live gig at the Electric Ballroom in Camden; background = group_or_band origin\n| = London, United Kingdom genre = Alternative rock, new prog years_active = 2009-\n| 2010 label = Big Teeth Music website = http://www.feederweb.com\n| associated_acts = Feeder Ben's Brother past_members = Grant\n| Nicholas Taka Hirose Karl Brazil\n}} 'Renegades' were a British rock band, which started out as a side-project\nfrom two members of the band Feeder, featuring guitarist Grant Nicholas and\nbassist Taka Hirose, before becoming a pseudonym name for Feeder themselves.\nNicholas formed Renegades alongside Hirose with Karl Brazil from Ben's Brother,\nwho completed the group and a 4-track EP was then recorded. Soon later,\nRenegades became an alternative name for Feeder at various concerts where they\nwould play an entire show pretending not to be Feeder, but a different band with\nthe same members. If Feeder songs released before the [[Renegades (Feeder\nalbum)|Renegades]] album were to be played, the band would announce that they're\ncovering Feeder songs. Grant Nicholas once introduced \"Tangerine\" as \"A cover of\na song from a band we know\".\n\nThe idea was created when Feeder parted company with drummer Mark Richardson who\nreturned to his previous band Skunk Anansie. Brazil was initially contracted\nwith the band to assist them on their June dates playing various university\nevents, before then playing the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival. He was\nhowever recording with the band alongside Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter, before\nthe idea came about to use a selection of the tracks for the 'Renegades'\nproject. The tracks originally intended for the side-project were soon used for\nthe seventh Feeder album Renegades. The side-project was a result used as a\nmethod to promote the Renegades album at live shows where they would mainly play\nthe new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as\nFeeder.\n\nOn the first of January 2010, a four-day countdown timer was added to the band's\nofficial website. As the countdown was completed on 6 January 2010, the title-\ntrack for the EP, \"Renegades\" was released as a free download as well as a\npackage containing the limited edition EP, Renegades shirt, badge set and an e-\nticket for one of the six shows available. The Renegades\nEP was the first release on the band's own record label, before being followed-\nup by a second EP. Feeder also used the Renegades name for their Sonisphere 2010\nappearance, which was their last show using this name and also their tour of\nJapan in July of the same year. The track \"Renegades\" was re-released, but this\ntime as a Feeder single instead of Renegades and was also on vinyl and download\nonly. As Renegades was technically a separate band from Feeder, Renegades became\nthe first ever British band in history to sell out at least one gig without\nreleasing any material commercially.\n","linknr":230,"url":"Renegades_(band)","recorded":1374549323,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/File:Renegades_Camden.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Renegades_Camden.JPG/220px-Renegades_Camden.JPG","/wiki/Electric_Ballroom","/wiki/Camden_Town","/wiki/London","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Alternative_rock","/wiki/New_prog","/wiki/Record_label","/wiki/Feeder","/wiki/Ben%27s_Brother","http://www.feederweb.com","/wiki/Grant_Nicholas","/wiki/Taka_Hirose","/wiki/Karl_Brazil","/wiki/Feeder","/wiki/Grant_Nicholas","/wiki/Taka_Hirose","/wiki/Pseudonym","/wiki/Karl_Brazil","/wiki/Ben%27s_Brother","/wiki/Renegades_(Feeder_album)","/wiki/Cover_version","/wiki/Mark_Richardson_(musician)","/wiki/Skunk_Anansie","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Sonisphere_Festival","/wiki/Mexicolas","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-XFM-2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","#Band_members","#Live_sets","#Business_practice","#Grant_Nicholas_on_Renegades","#Discography","#Extended_plays","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Grant_Nicholas","/wiki/Lead_vocals","/wiki/Guitar","/wiki/Taka_Hirose","/wiki/Bassist","/wiki/Drummer","/wiki/Dean_Tidey","/wiki/Casino_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Tangerine_(Feeder_song)","/wiki/Swim_(EP)","/wiki/Polythene_(album)","/wiki/XFM","/wiki/Nirvana_(band)","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Simple_living","/wiki/E-ticket","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-culturedeluxe-4","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=6","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Feeder","/wiki/Ben%27s_Brother","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-1","http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music-features/renegades-make-good-their-escape-1.1020456","#cite_ref-XFM_2-0","http://www.xfm.co.uk/news/2009/feeder-return","#cite_ref-3","http://www.nme.com/news/feeder/39234","#cite_ref-culturedeluxe_4-0","http://www.culturedeluxe.com/music/interview/interview-feeder/","/w/index.php?title=Renegades_(band)&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Template:Feeder","/wiki/Template_talk:Feeder","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Feeder&action=edit","/wiki/Feeder","/wiki/Grant_Nicholas","/wiki/Taka_Hirose","/wiki/Karl_Brazil","/wiki/Jon_Lee_(drummer)","/wiki/Mark_Richardson_(musician)","/wiki/Album","/wiki/Polythene_(album)","/wiki/Yesterday_Went_Too_Soon","/wiki/Echo_Park_(album)","/wiki/Comfort_in_Sound","/wiki/Pushing_the_Senses","/wiki/Silent_Cry","/wiki/Renegades_(Feeder_album)","/wiki/Generation_Freakshow_(album)","/wiki/Extended_play","/wiki/Two_Colours_EP","/wiki/Swim_(EP)","/wiki/ITunes_Live:_London_Festival_%2708_(Feeder)","/wiki/Seven_Sleepers_(Feeder_EP)","/wiki/Compilation_album","/wiki/Another_Yesterday","/wiki/Swim_(EP)","/wiki/Best_Days_in_the_Sun","/wiki/Picture_of_Perfect_Youth","/wiki/The_Singles_(Feeder)","/wiki/Single_(music)","/wiki/Stereo_World","/wiki/Tangerine_(Feeder_song)","/wiki/Cement_(song)","/wiki/Crash_(Feeder_song)","/wiki/High_(Feeder_song)","/wiki/Suffocate_(Feeder_song)","/wiki/Day_in_Day_Out","/wiki/Insomnia_(Feeder_song)","/wiki/Yesterday_Went_Too_Soon_(song)","/wiki/Paperfaces","/wiki/Buck_Rogers_(song)","/wiki/Seven_Days_in_the_Sun","/wiki/Turn_(Feeder_song)","/wiki/Piece_by_Piece_(song)","/wiki/Just_a_Day","/wiki/Come_Back_Around","/wiki/Just_the_Way_I%27m_Feeling","/wiki/Forget_About_Tomorrow","/wiki/Find_the_Colour","/wiki/Comfort_in_Sound_(song)","/wiki/Tumble_and_Fall","/wiki/Feeling_a_Moment","/wiki/Pushing_the_Senses_(song)","/wiki/Shatter_(song)","/wiki/L
