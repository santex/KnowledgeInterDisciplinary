There is only one 0-tuple, an empty sequence. An <math>n</math>-tuple\nis defined inductively using the construction of an ordered pair. Tuples are\nusually written by listing the elements within parentheses \"<math>(\\text{\n})</math>\" and separated by commas; for example, <math>(2, 7, 4, 1, 7)</math>\ndenotes a 5-tuple. Sometimes other delimiters are used, such as square brackets\n\"<math>[\\text{ }]</math>\" or angle brackets \"<math>\\langle\\text{\n}\\rangle</math>\". Braces \"<math>\\{\\}</math>\" are almost never used for tuples,\nas they are the standard notation for sets.\n\nTuples are often used to describe other mathematical objects, such as vectors.\nIn computer science, tuples are directly implemented as product types in most\nfunctional programming languages. More commonly, they are implemented as\nrecord types, where the components are labeled instead of being identified by\nposition alone. This approach is also used in relational algebra. Tuples are\nalso used in relation to programming the semantic web with Resource\nDescription Framework or RDF.\n","title":"Tuple","headings":["Etymology","Properties","Definitions","Relational model","Type theory","See also","Notes","References"]},"micro-relation":["2: Set_theory","2: Ordered_pair","2: Product_type","2: Relational_algebra","1: Mathematics","1: Computer_science","1: Sequence","1: Recursive_definition","1: Functional_programming","1: Semantic_web","1: Resource_Description_Framework","1: Latin","1: Complex_number","1: Quaternion","1: Octonion","1: Sedenion","1: If_and_only_if","1: Ordered_pair#Kuratowski_definition","1: Database_theory","1: Relational_model","1: User-friendly","1: Serge_Abiteboul","1: Victor_Vianu","1: Total_order","1: Database_table","1: Type_theory","1: Programming_language","1: Record_type","1: Simply_typed_lambda_calculus","1: Model_theory","1: Preprint","1: Unit_type","1: Arity","1: Exponential_object","1: Formal_language","1: Prime_k-tuple","1: Tuplespace","1: Abraham_Adolf_Fraenkel","1: Yehoshua_Bar-Hillel","1: Azriel_Lévy","1: Gaisi_Takeuti","1: Graduate_texts_in_mathematics","1: Keith_Devlin"]}
