A pallet is the structural foundation of a unit load which allows\nhandling and storage efficiencies. Goods or shipping containers are often placed\non a pallet secured with strapping, stretch wrap or shrink wrap and shipped.\n\nWhile most pallets are wooden, pallets also are made of plastic, metal, and\npaper. Each material has advantages and disadvantages relative to the others.\n(See the sections \"Phytosanitary compliance\" and \"Materials used\" below.)\n","linknr":564,"url":"Pallet","recorded":1362675378,"links":53,"instances":["deformation","mechanical","woodworking","container","equipment","machine"],"pdf":["http://www.ista.org/Knowledge/Pallets_101-Clarke_2004.pdf","http://www.ispm15.com/Methyl_bromide_Decision_2008_753_EC.pdf"],"categories":["Commercial item transport and distribution","Packaging"],"headings":["Overview","Standardization and regulation","Pallet construction","History","Alternative uses","Fire hazards","Food safety risks","See also","Notes and references","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Wooden_pallet_with_glove.jpg/220px-Wooden_pallet_with_glove.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Plastic_pallet.jpg/220px-Plastic_pallet.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/MetalPalets.jpg/220px-MetalPalets.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg/220px-Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Steel_Pallet.JPG/220px-Steel_Pallet.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Plan_palette-europe.svg/220px-Plan_palette-europe.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/IPPC_standard.png/220px-IPPC_standard.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Warehouse_md17.jpg/250px-Warehouse_md17.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Crowbar_%28PSF%29.jpg/150px-Crowbar_%28PSF%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Tidy_Stacks_of_Pallets.jpg/220px-Tidy_Stacks_of_Pallets.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["loader","equipment"],["jack","mechanical"],["race","container"],["stringer","woodworking"],["creep","deformation"],["crane","machine"]],"members":["creep","jack","stringer","race","loader","crane"],"related":["KUKA","Forklift","Pallet_jack","Loader_(equipment)","Jack_(mechanical)","Unit_load","Shipping_container","Strapping","Stretch_wrap","Shrink_wrap","Wood","Plastic","Metal","Paper","Containerization","Intermodal_container","United_States","Forklift","Pallet_jack","Costume_jewelry","Warehouse","Warehouse","Forklift","Pallet_jack","Warehouse","Intermodal_container","International_Organization_for_Standardization","ISO_container","RACE_(container)","ISO_container","WWII","ISPM_15","Unit_load","European_Committee_for_Standardization","International_Plant_Protection_Convention","Invasive_species","Insects","Plant_disease","ISPM_15","Fumigation","Methyl_bromide","Steel","Aluminum","Plastic","Engineered_wood","Plywood","Oriented_strand_board","Corrugated_fiberboard","Stringer_(woodworking)","Softwood","Hardwood","Paper_Pallet","Paper","Plastic_pallets","HDPE","Polyethylene_terphthalate","Creep_(deformation)","Dolly","Steel","Aluminum","Forklift","Pallet_crafts","Skateboarding","Manual_pad","Paintball","Taylor_Guitars","Architecture_for_humanity","University_of_Vienna","National_Fire_Protection_Association","Fire_sprinkler_system","Listeria","National_Consumers_League","CBS_News","463L_master_pallet","US_Air_Force","Bulk_box","CHEP","Concrete_block","Crane_(machine)","Forklift_truck","International_Plant_Protection_Convention","ISPM_15","Molded_pulp","Packaging_and_labeling","Pallet_inverters","Palletizer","Plastic_pallet","Slip_sheet","Stillage","Stretch_wrap","Unit_Load_Device","Unit_Load","ASTM","ASTM"]}
