{"cursor":"3799","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In drilling technology, 'casing string' is a long section of connected oilfield\npipe that is lowered into a wellbore and cemented. The pipe segments (called\n\"joints\") are typically about in length, male threaded on each end and connected\nwith short lengths of double-female threaded pipe called couplings. (Some\nspecialty casing is manufactured in one piece with a female thread machined\ndirectly into one end.)\n\nSpecification 5C3 of the American Petroleum Institute standardizes 14 casing\nsizes from to outside diameter (\"OD\"). Technical Report on Equations and\nCalculations for Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe used as Casing or Tubing; and\nPerformance Properties Tables for Casing and Tubing: 7th Edition, 2008, American\nPetroleum Institute, 1220 L Street NW, Washington DC 20005-4070 USA This\nand related API documents also promulgate standards for the threaded end finish,\nthe wall thickness (several are available in each size to satisfy various design\nparameters, and in fact are indirectly specified by standardized nominal weights\nper linear foot; thicker pipe obviously being heavier), and the strength and\ncertain chemical characteristics of the steel material. Several material\nstrengthsâtermed \"Grades\" and ranging from to minimum yield strengthâare\navailable for most combinations of OD and wall thickness to meet various design\nneeds. Finally, the API publications provide performance minimums for\nlongitudinal strength (\"joint strength\") as well as resistance to internal\n(bursting) and external (collapsing) pressure differentials.\n\nA typical piece of casing might be described as 9-5/8\" 53.5# P-110 LT&C Rg 3:\nspecifying OD, weight per foot (53.5 lbm/ft thus 0.545-inch wall thickness and\n8.535-inch inside diameter), steel strength (110,000 psi yield strength), end\nfinish (\"Long Threaded and Coupled\"), and approximate length (\"Range 3\" usually\nruns between 40 and 42 feet).\n\nCasing is run to protect or isolate formations adjacent to the wellbore. It is\ngenerally not possible to drill a well through all of the formations from\nsurface (or the seabed) to the target depth in one whole section. For example,\nfresh-water-bearing zones (usually found only near the surface) must be\nprotected soon after being penetrated. The well is therefore drilled in\nsections, with each section of the well being sealed off by lining the inside of\nthe borehole with steel pipe, known as casing, and filling the annular space (or\nat least the lower portion) between this casing string and the borehole with\ncement. Then drilling commences on the subsequent hole section, necessarily with\na smaller bit diameter that will pass through the newly installed casing.\n\nA liner is a casing string that does not extend to the surface, being hung\ninstead from a liner hanger set inside of the previous casing string but usually\nwithin about of its bottom. Other than the obvious cost savings, the liner\ninstallation allows larger drill pipe or production tubing to be used in the\nupper portions of the well. (A disadvantage is the occasional difficulty in\neffecting a pressure seal by squeeze cementing the casing-liner overlap zone.)\n\nDepending on the conditions encountered (e.g., zones of differing formation\npressure gradients), three or four casing strings may be required to reach the\ntarget depth. The cost of the casing can constitute 20-30% of the total cost of\nthe well. Great care must therefore be taken when designing a casing programme\nthat will meet the requirements of the well.\n","linknr":80,"url":"Casing_string","recorded":1364049721,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Oil_well","/wiki/American_Petroleum_Institute","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Drill_pipe","/wiki/Production_tubing","/wiki/Squeeze_job","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&oldid=544553063","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Drilling_technology","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_May_2009","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Casing+string&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Casing+string","/wiki/Casing_string","/wiki/Talk:Casing_string","#","/wiki/Casing_string","/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Casing_string","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Casing_string","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&oldid=544553063","/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Casing_string&id=544553063","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Casing+string","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Casing+string&oldid=544553063&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Casing_string&printable=yes","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rura_ok%C5%82adzinowa","//uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Casing string","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casing_string","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Drilling technology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Oil_well","American_Petroleum_Institute","Drill_pipe","Production_tubing","Squeeze_job"]}
