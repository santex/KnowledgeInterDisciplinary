{"cursor":"6110","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Order}}\n\n\nIn scientific classification used in biology, the 'order' () is\n# a taxonomic rank used in the classification of organisms. Other well-known\n# ranks are life, domain, kingdom, phylum, class, family, genus, and species,\n# with order fitting in between class and family. An immediately higher rank,\n# 'superorder', may be added directly above order, while 'suborder' would be a\n# lower rank. a taxonomic unit, a taxon, in that rank. In that case the plural\n# is orders (Latin ordines).\n\n::Example: Walnuts and hickories belong to the family Juglandaceae (or walnut\n:family), which is placed in the order Fagales.\n\nWhat does and does not belong to each order is determined by a taxonomist.\nSimilarly for the question if a particular order should be recognized at all.\nOften there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists each taking a\ndifferent position. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in\ndescribing or recognizing an order. Some taxa are accepted almost universally,\nwhile others are recognised only rarely.\n\nFor some groups of organisms, consistent suffixes are used to denote that the\nrank is an order. The Latin suffix -(i)formes meaning \"having the form of\" is\nused for the scientific name of orders of birds and fishes, but not for those of\nmammals and invertebrates. The suffix -ales is for the name of orders of\nvascular plants.\n","linknr":324,"url":"Order_(biology)","recorded":1362559487,"links":98,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","zoology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific classification|rank08","Botanical nomenclature|Order","Plant taxonomy|1rank08","Zoological nomenclature|rank08","Orders (biology)|"],"headings":["Hierarchy of ranks","History of the concept","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg/150px-Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Issoria_lathonia.jpg/32px-Issoria_lathonia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain","biology"],["kingdom","biology"],["class","biology"],["family","biology"],["kingdom","biology"],["class","biology"],["rank","botany"],["rank","zoology"]],"members":["domain","kingdom","class","rank","family"],"related":["Biological_classification","Biology","Taxonomic_rank","Life","Domain_(biology)","Kingdom_(biology)","Phylum","Class_(biology)","Family_(biology)","Genus","Species","Taxon","Plural","Walnut","Hickory","Juglandaceae","Fagales","Taxonomist","Suffix","Scientific_name","Birds","Fishes","Mammal","Invertebrate","Vascular_plant","Clade","Prefix","Magnorder","Epitheria","Superorder","Euarchontoglires","Grandorder","Euarchonta","Mirorder","Primatomorpha","Primates","Suborder","Haplorrhini","Infraorder","Simiiformes","Parvorder","Catarrhini","Botanist","Augustus_Quirinus_Rivinus","Carolus_Linnaeus","Kingdom_(biology)","Mineral","Plant","Animal","Class_(biology)","Taxa","Michel_Adanson","Plural","Alphonse_Louis_Pierre_Pyrame_de_Candolle","Botanical_nomenclature","Descriptive_botanical_names","Zoology","Lepidoptera","Moth","Butterfly","Diptera","Fly","Mosquito","Midge","Gnat","Cladistics","Phylogenetics","Rank_(botany)","Rank_(zoology)","Biological_classification","Systematics","Taxonomy","Virus_classification"]}
