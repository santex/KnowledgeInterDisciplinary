{"cursor":"6752","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAfter the end of the American Civil War, as part of the on-going process of\nReconstruction, the United States Congress passed four statutes known as\n'Reconstruction Acts'. (March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 428-430, c.153; March 23, 1867,\n15 Stat. 2-5, c.6, July 19, 1867, 15 Stat. 14-16, c.30; and March 11, 1868, 15\nStat. 41, c.25) The actual title of [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-\nbin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=014/llsl014.db&recNum=459 the initial\nlegislation] was \"An act to provide for the more efficient government of the\nRebel States\" and it was passed on March 2, 1867. Fulfillment of the\nrequirements of the Acts were necessary for the former Confederate States to be\nreadmitted to the Union. The Acts excluded [http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/reconstruction/timeline-\nterms/tennessee-re-admitted-union Tennessee], which had already ratified the\n14th Amendment and had been readmitted to the Union.\n\nA key feature of the Acts included the creation of five military districts in\nthe South, each commanded by a general, which would serve as the acting\ngovernment for the region. National Archives, War Department Records,\n[http://research.archives.gov/organization/1140554 Second Military District\n3/11/1867 - 7/28/1868, Administrative History Note]: The\nestablishment of military government in the Southern states as a feature of the\nsystem imposed under the Reconstruction Acts was due primarily to the fact that\nthe introduction of Negro suffrage was thought to be possible only through a\nshow of strength. In May and June of 1865 President Andrew Johnson had appointed\nProvisional Governors for the Southern states and had ordered the enforcement of\nFederal laws in those states. These measures were intended to have the result,\nwhen a state's constitution should have been amended, of restoring the state \"to\nits constitutional relations to the Federal Government,\" but Congress, by an act\nof March 2, 1867 (14 Stat. 428), divided the ten Southern states into five\nmilitary districts, each to be commanded by an officer not below the rank of\nbrigadier general. Under the act the primary duties of these commanders were \"to\nprotect all persons in their rights of person and property, to suppress\ninsurrection, disorder, and violence, and to punish, or cause to be punished,\nall disturbers of the public peace and criminals.\" Their duties in the\nreorganization of the state governments, as set forth in an act of March 23,\n1867 (15 Stat. 2), were extended to include the registration of qualified voters\nwho had taken the oath of allegiance to the United States, the supervision of\nthe election of delegates to state constitutional conventions, and the\ntransmittal to the President of certified copies of the constitutions adopted.\nThe War Department, in conformity with the act of March 2, issued AGO General\nOrder 10, March 12, 1867. which assigned commanders and announced locations of\nthe several headquarters. The powers of these commanders were both civil and\nmilitary; and the civil powers exercised were usually referred to as \"military\ngovernment.\" So far as their military duties were concerned, district commanders\nwere subordinate to the General of the Army and the Secretary of War just as\nwere department commanders. In their civil capacity, however, district\ncommanders were entirely independent of the War Department except in matters of\nremoval, appointment, and detail. An act of July 19, 1867 (12 Stat. 14) defined\nthe powers of the district commander to suspend or remove from office persons\noccupying positions in the civil government of the state concerned; the\nprovisional governments established by the President were thus made subject to\nthe military commanders. A joint resolution of February 18, 1869 (15 Stat. 344),\nprovided for the removal from office of persons holding civil offices in the\n\"provisional governments\" of Virginia, Texas, and Mississippi who could not take\nthe oath of allegiance and directed the district commanders to fill the\nresulting vacancies by the appointment of persons who could take the oath. Major\nGeneral Daniel E. Sickles assumed command of the Second Military District on\nMarch 21, 1867. The military subdistricts of North and South Carolina were\ndiscontinued in April 1867, and the territory embraced in the command was\ndivided into posts. This organization was found to facilitate the transaction of\nbusiness and the prompt administration of justice. Post commanders were\nimmediately responsible for seeing that people within their jurisdiction obeyed\nall existing laws and orders. To bring about more efficient administration of\njustice and to give greater security to life and property, the sheriffs and\nother officers of municipal organizations with the District were put under the\nimmediate control of a military officer--the provost marshal general. Sheriffs,\nchiefs of police, city marshals, chiefs of detectives, and town marshals in\nNorth and South Carolina were ordered to report to him.\n\nIn addition, Congress required that each state draft a new state constitution,\nwhich would have to be approved by Congress. The states also were required to\nratify the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and grant\nvoting rights to black men.\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson's vetoes of these measures were overridden by Congress.\nAfter [[Ex Parte McCardle]] (1867) came before the Supreme Court, Congress\nfeared that the Court might strike the Reconstruction Acts down as\nunconstitutional. To prevent this, Congress repealed the Habeas Corpus Act 1867,\nrevoking to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the case.\n\nGovernor of Georgia Charles J. Jenkins, elected in 1865 as the only candidate to\nsucceed James Johnson (appointed by President Andrew Johnson), was replaced by\nGeneral George Meade (of the Third Military District) with Brig. General Thomas\nH. Ruger.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Reconstruction_Acts","recorded":1374858300,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Wikisource","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Special:Search/Reconstruction_Acts","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States","/wiki/United_States_Congress","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=014/llsl014.db&recNum=459","/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America","http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/reconstruction/timeline-terms/tennessee-re-admitted-union","/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","http://research.archives.gov/organization/1140554","/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","/wiki/Andrew_Johnson","/wiki/Vetoes","/wiki/Ex_Parte_McCardle","/wiki/Habeas_Corpus_Act_1867","/wiki/Governor_of_Georgia","/wiki/Charles_J._Jenkins","/wiki/James_Johnson_(Georgia)","/wiki/George_Meade","/wiki/Third_Military_District","/wiki/Thomas_H._Ruger","#cite_note-1","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://books.google.com/books?id=CmETAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA830","/wiki/OCLC","//www.worldcat.org/oclc/1855247","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Reconstruction_Amendments","/wiki/First_Military_District","/wiki/Second_Military_District","/wiki/Third_Military_District","/wiki/Fourth_Military_District","/wiki/Fifth_Military_District","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&oldid=560132596","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Reconstruction_Era","/wiki/Category:United_States_federal_legislation","/wiki/Category:United_States_federal_civil_rights_legislation","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_September_2011","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reconstruction+Acts&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reconstruction+Acts","/wiki/Reconstruction_Acts","/wiki/Talk:Reconstruction_Acts","#","/wiki/Reconstruction_Acts","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Reconstruction_Acts","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Reconstruction_Acts","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&oldid=560132596","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7302779","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Reconstruction_Acts&id=560132596","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Reconstruction+Acts","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Reconstruction+Acts&oldid=560132596&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Reconstruction_Acts&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Acts","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7302779#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/
