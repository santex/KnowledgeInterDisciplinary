{"cursor":"26789","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Paper' is a thin material mainly used for writing upon, printing upon, drawing\nor for packaging. It is produced by pressing together moist fibers, typically\ncellulose pulp derived from wood, rags or grasses, and drying them into\nflexible sheets.\n\nPaper is a versatile material with many uses. Whilst the most common is for\nwriting and printing upon, it is also widely used as a packaging material, in\nmany cleaning products, in a number of industrial and construction processes,\nand even as a food ingredient â particularly in Asian cultures.\n\nPaper, and the pulp papermaking process, was said to be developed in China\nduring the early 2nd century AD by the Han court eunuch Cai Lun, although the\nearliest archaeological fragments of paper derive from the 2nd century BC in\nChina.\n","linknr":605,"url":"Paper","recorded":1362506931,"links":141,"instances":["disambiguation","message","paper","material","admission"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Paper|","Printing
