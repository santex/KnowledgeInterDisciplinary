Many works within the\ngenre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are\ncommon. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction\nand horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre\nthemes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three,\nall of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.\n\nIn popular culture, the fantasy genre is predominantly of the medievalist form,\nespecially since the worldwide success of [[The Lord of the Rings]] and related\nbooks by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense, however, fantasy comprises\nworks by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths\nand legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.\n\nFantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English,\ncultural studies, comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in\nthis area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which\nemphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections\n(political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular\nculture.<ref>Jane Tolmie, \"Medievalism and the Fantasy Heroine\", [[Journal of\nGender Studies]], Vol. 15, No. 2 (July 2006), pp. 145â€“158.
