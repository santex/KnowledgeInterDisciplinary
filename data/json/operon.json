Several genes must be both co-transcribed and\nco-regulated to define an operon.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Lodish | first1=Harvey\n| last2=Zipursky | first2=Lawrence | last3=Matsudaira | first3=Paul |\nlast4=Baltimore | first4=David | last5=Darnel | first5=James | title=Molecular\nCell Biology | publisher=W.
