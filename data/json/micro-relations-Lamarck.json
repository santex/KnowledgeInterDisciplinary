He\nwas a soldier, biologist, academic, and an early proponent of the idea that\nevolution occurred and proceeded in accordance with natural laws.\n\nLamarck fought in the Pomeranian War with Prussia, and was awarded a commission\nfor bravery on the battlefield. Damkaer (2002), p. 117. At his post\nin Monaco, Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study\nmedicine. Packard (1901), p. 15. He retired from the army\nafter being injured in 1766, and returned to his medical studies.\n\nLamarck developed a particular interest in botany, and later, after he published\na three-volume work Flore franÃ§aise, he gained membership of the French Academy\nof Sciences in 1779. Lamarck became involved in the Jardin des Plantes and was\nappointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788. When the MusÃ©um national d'Histoire\nnaturelle was founded in 1793, Lamarck was appointed as a professor of zoology.\n\nIn 1801, he published SystÃ¨me des animaux sans vertÃ¨bres, a major work on the\nclassification of invertebrates, a term he coined. In an 1802 publication, he\nbecame one of the first to use the term [[biology]] in its modern sense. Coleman (1977), pp. 1â2. Lamarck continued his work as a\npremier authority on invertebrate zoology. He is remembered, at least in\nmalacology, as a taxonomist of considerable stature.\n\nIn the modern era, Lamarck is widely remembered for a theory of inheritance of\nacquired characteristics, called soft inheritance, Lamarckism or use/disuse\ntheory. Jurmain ''et al.'' (2011), pp. 27â39. However, his idea of\nsoft inheritance was, perhaps, a reflection of the folk wisdom of the time,\naccepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary\ntheory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of evolution, Ed.\nPhillip Appleman. Darwin: A Norton Critical Edition. 3rd Edition. New York City:\nW.W. Norton & Company, 2001. 44. in which an alchemical complexifying\nforce drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental\nforce adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of\ncharacteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. Gould (2002), p. 187.\n","linknr":723,"url":"Lamarck","recorded":1362483122,"links":88,"instances":["botany","science","1747","biology","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Articles with inconsistent
