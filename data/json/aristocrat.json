Specifically, in\nmonarchies, the aristocracy are a class of people (aristocrats) who either\npossess hereditary titles granted by a monarch or are related to such people. In\nsome societies—such as Ancient Greece, Rome, and India—aristocratic status may\nderive from membership of a military caste. Aristocratic status can involve\nfeudal or legal privileges.<ref>The aristocrats: a portrait of Britain's\nnobility and their way of life today, by Roy Perrott, (London 1968), page5-\n10</ref> They are usually below only the monarch of a country or nation in its\nsocial hierarchy.\n\nThe term aristocracy derives from the Greek ἀριστοκρατία\n([[aristocracy|aristokratia]]), ἄριστος (aristos) \"excellent,\" and κράτος\n(kratos) \"power\".<ref>The Oxford Companion to British History, John Cannon\n(Editor), Oxford University Press, 1997, ISBN 978-0-19-866176-4</ref> In most\ncases, aristocratic titles were and are hereditary, passing on death to another\nfamily member, typically the eldest son or eldest child.\n",
