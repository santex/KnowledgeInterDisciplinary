He is a half brother to Guillotine, winner of the 2008\nMVRC Dato Tan Chin Nam Stakes.\n\nIn his first campaign in the spring of 2006 he put together five consecutive\nwins including the Group 2 Aami Vase at Moonee Valley and ending with a win in\nthe VRC Derby by 2Â½ lengths. Following his Derby win Efficient was entered into\nthe Melbourne Cup field, run three days later. However, he did not pull up well\nenough and so was scratched from the race and spelled instead.\n\nReturning in the autumn Efficient had a very light campaign of just two starts.\nIn the 1,400 metre Group 3 Schweppervescence Cup he finished fourth behind\nHaradasun and fifth behind Miss Finland in the Group One Australian Guineas over\n1,600 metres.\n\nAs a four year old in the Spring of 2007 Efficient resumed in the Memsie Stakes\nat Caulfield and ran 10th beaten 7 lengths. At his next start he ran fourth in\nthe Group 2 Dato Tan Chin Nam Stakes behind El Segundo and Haradasun. He then\nran unplaced in the 2,000 metre Group 1 Turnbull Stakes. Three weeks later\nEfficient lined up in the Weight for Age Group 1 Cox Plate over 2,040 metres at\nMoonee Valley where he finished 9th beaten 6Â½ lengths by the winner El Segundo.\nEfficient's next start was the Melbourne Cup, his first start in a handicap race\nsince his first campaign. He dropped 3 kg from the Cox Plate run to carry\n54.5 kg. Due to his poor recent form he was sent out a 16-1 chance.\nReunited with jockey Michael Rodd for the first time since their 2006 Victoria\nDerby win, Efficient settled back in the field and travelled well. He was pulled\nto the outside to make a run and in the closing stages Efficient went on to\ndefeat Purple Moon by half a length.\n\nHis win dividend of $22.70 was the biggest for a Melbourne Cup winner in over\nten years. He became the first grey to win the Melbourne Cup since Subzero in\n1992 and the first horse since Phar Lap to win the Melbourne Cup the year after\nwinning the Victoria Derby.\n\nEfficient was trained by expatriate New Zealand trainer Graeme Rogerson to win\nthe cup, but switched to John Sadler soon after Rogerson decided to part company\nwith the horse's owners, a syndicate headed by Lloyd and Suzy Williams.\n\nEfficient has had an injury-plagued career since his Melbourne Cup win, and was\nwithdrawn from both the 2008 and 2009 Melbourne Cups in the fortnight leading up\nto the race. However, he did gain a third Group One success in the 2009 Turnbull\nStakes. After this success Efficient did not race for almost two years.\n\nHe returned to racing in September 2011 but did not show any form until he ran\nsecond to Niwot in the 3200 metre Sydney Cup at Randwick in April 2012. On 4\nOctober 2012, Efficient's owner Lloyd Williams, announced that the horse had\nsuffered a recurrence of an old injury and had been retired. {{cite news|\nurl =
