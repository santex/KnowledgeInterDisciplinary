      "text" : "\n\n and American Union]] An 'organisation' is a social entity that has a collective\n goal and is linked to an external environment. The word is derived from the\n Greek word organon, itself derived from the better-known word ergon which means\n \"organ\"&nbsp;– a compartment for a particular task. There are a variety of\n legal types of organizations, including corporations, governments, non-\n governmental organizations, international organizations, armed forces,\n charities, not-for-profit corporations, partnerships, cooperatives, and\n universities. A hybrid organization is a body that operates in both the public\n sector and the private sector simultaneously, fulfilling public duties and\n developing commercial market activities.\n\nIn the social sciences, organizations are the object of analysis for a number\nof disciplines, such as sociology, economics,<ref name=\"Sytse Douma\n2013\"></ref> political science, psychology, management, and organizational\ncommunication. The broader analysis of organizations is commonly referred to as\norganizational structure, organizational studies, organizational behavior, or\norganization analysis. A number of different perspectives exist, some of which\nare compatible: *From a process-related perspective, an organization is viewed\nas an entity is being (re-)organized, and the focus is on the organization as a\nset of tasks or actions. *From a functional perspective, the focus is on how\nentities like businesses or state authorities are used. *From an institutional\nperspective, an organization is viewed as a purposeful structure within a\nsocial context.\n\nSociology can be defined as the science of the institutions of modernity;\nspecific institutions serve a function, akin to the individual organs of a\ncoherent body. In the social and political sciences in general, an\n\"organization\" may be more loosely understood as the planned, coordinated and\npurposeful action of human beings working through collective action to reach a\ncommon goal or construct a tangible product. This action is usually framed by\nformal membership and form (institutional rules). Sociology distinguishes the\nterm organization into planned formal and unplanned informal (i.e. spontaneously\nformed) organizations. Sociology analyzes organizations in the first line from\nan institutional perspective. In this sense, organization is a permanent\narrangement of elements. These elements and their actions are determined by\nrules so that a certain task can be fulfilled through a system of coordinated\ndivision of labor.\n\nEconomic approaches to organizations also take the division of labor as a\nstarting point. The division of labor allows for (economies of) specialization.\nIncreasing specialization necessitates coordination. From an economic point of\nview, markets and organizations are alternative coordination mechanisms for the\nexecution of transactions.<ref name=\"Sytse Douma 2013\"/>\n\nAn organization is defined by the elements that are part of it (who belongs to\nthe organization and who does not?), its communication (which elements\ncommunicate and how do they communicate?), its autonomy (which changes are\nexecuted autonomously by the organization or its elements?), and its rules of\naction compared to outside events (what causes an organization to act as a\ncollective actor?).\n\nBy coordinated and planned cooperation of the elements, the organization is able\nto solve tasks that lie beyond the abilities of the single elements. The price\npaid by the elements is the limitation of the degrees of freedom of the\nelements. Advantages of organizations are enhancement (more of the same),\naddition (combination of different features) and extension. Disadvantages can be\ninertness (through co-ordination) and loss of interaction.\n",
