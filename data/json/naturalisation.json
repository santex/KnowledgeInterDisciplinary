      "text" : "\n\n\n\n\n'Naturalization' (or 'naturalisation') is the acquisition of citizenship and\nnationality by somebody who was not a citizen of that country (foreign).\n\nIn general, basic requirements for naturalization are that the applicant hold a\nlegal status as a full-time resident for a minimum period of time and that the\napplicant promise to obey and uphold that country's laws, to which an oath or\npledge of allegiance is sometimes added. Some countries also require that a\nnaturalized national must renounce any other citizenship that they currently\nhold, forbidding dual citizenship, but whether this renunciation actually causes\nloss of the person's original citizenship will again depend on the laws of the\ncountries involved.\n\nNationality is traditionally based either on [[jus soli]] (\"right of the\nterritory\") or on [[jus sanguinis]] (\"right of blood\"), although it now usually\nmixes both. Whatever the case, the massive increase in population flux due to\nglobalization and the sharp increase in the numbers of refugees following World\nWar I created an important class of non-citizens called stateless persons. In\nsome rare cases, procedures of mass naturalization were passed. As\nnaturalization laws were created to deal with the rare case of people separated\nfrom their nation state because they lived abroad (expatriates), western\ndemocracies were not ready to naturalize the massive influx of stateless people\nwhich followed massive denationalizations and the expulsion of ethnic minorities\nfrom newly created nation states in the first part of the 20th century, but they\nalso counted the (mostly aristocratic) Russians who had escaped the 1917 October\nRevolution and the war communism period, and then the Spanish refugees. As\nHannah Arendt pointed out, internment camps became the \"only nation\" of such\nstateless people, since they were often considered \"undesirable\" and were stuck\nin an illegal situation (their country had expelled them or deprived them of\ntheir nationality, while they hadn't been naturalized, thus living in a judicial\nno man's land).\n\nAfter World War II, the increase in international migrations created a new\ncategory of refugees, most of them economic refugees. For economic, political,\nhumanitarian and pragmatic reasons, many states passed laws allowing a person to\nacquire their citizenship after birth (such as by marriage to a national – 'jus\nmatrimonii' – or by having ancestors who are nationals of that country), in\norder to reduce the scope of this category. However, in some countries this\nsystem still maintains a large part of the immigrated population in an illegal\nstatus, albeit some massive regularizations (in Spain by José Luis Zapatero's\ngovernment and in Italy by Berlusconi's government).\n",
