[http://ww-\nw.secsports.com/index.php?s=&change_well_id=2&url_article_id=6216 SEC All-Time\nNational Champions] During the 2011â12 academic year, SEC members won a\ntotal of nine national championships, including football (Alabama), men's\nbasketball (Kentucky), gymnastics (Alabama), men's indoor track and field\n(Florida), equestrian (Texas A&M), women's golf (Alabama), softball (Alabama),\nwomen's tennis (Florida), and men's outdoor track and field (Florida). The SEC\nhas averaged almost seven national championships per year since 1990.\n\nListed below are all championship teams of NCAA-sponsored events, as well as the\ntitles won in football and equestrian, which are not official NCAA-sanctioned\nchampionships. Conference members have won at least one title in every sponsored\nsport in which the SEC participates except for women's volleyball. Between 1979\nand 1982, teams representing current member universities also claimed four AIAW\nChampionships.
