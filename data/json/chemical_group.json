Other divisions can be made.]] In\n organic chemistry, 'functional groups' are lexicon-specific groups of atoms or\n bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical\n reactions of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same\n or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a\n part of.<ref>Compendium of Chemical Terminology (IUPAC \"Gold Book\")\n http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02555.html</ref><ref></ref> However, its relative\n reactivity can be modified by nearby functional groups.\n\nThe word '[[wiktionary:moiety|moiety]]' is often used synonymously with\n\"functional group\" but, according to the IUPAC definition,<ref>IUPAC. Compendium\nof Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the \"Gold Book\"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught\nand A. Wilkinson. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1997). XML on-line\ncorrected version: http://goldbook.iupac.org (2006-) created by M. Nic, J.\nJirat, B. Kosata; updates compiled by A. Jenkins. ISBN 0-9678550-9-8\nhttp://goldbook.iupac.org/M03968.html</ref> a moiety is a part of a molecule\nthat may include either whole functional groups or parts of functional groups as\nsubstructures. For example, an ester (RCOOR') has an ester functional group\n(COOR) and is composed of an alkoxy moiety (-OR') and an acyl moiety (RCO-), or,\nequivalently, it may be divided into carboxylate (RCOO-) and alkyl (-R')\nmoieties. This definition allows for a recursive nature, where moieties may\ncontain functional groups which may contain moieties, etc. almost without limit\n(by definition, a functional group or moiety must have more than one atom, and\nthe combination and structure must be of interest in itself). For example,\nmethyl para-hydroxybenzoate contains a phenol functional group within the acyl\nmoiety, which in turn is part of the paraben moiety.\n\nCombining the names of functional groups with the names of the parent alkanes\ngenerates a powerful systematic nomenclature for naming organic compounds.\n\nThe atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the\nmolecule by covalent bonds. When the group of covalently bound atoms bears a net\ncharge, the group is referred to more properly as a polyatomic ion or a complex\nion. Any subgroup of atoms of a compound also may be called a 'radical', and if\na covalent bond is broken homolytically, the resulting fragment radicals are\nreferred as free radicals.\n\nThe first carbon atom after the carbon that attaches to the functional group is\ncalled the alpha carbon; the second, beta carbon, the third, gamma carbon, etc.\nIf there is another functional group at a carbon, it may be named with the Greek\nletter, e.g., the gamma-amine in gamma-aminobutanoic acid is on the third carbon\nof the carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid group.\n",
