{"cursor":"4650","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, 'chemical synthesis' is a purposeful execution of chemical\nreactions to get a product, or several products. This happens by physical and\nchemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern\nlaboratory usage, this tends to imply that the process is reproducible,\nreliable, and established to work in multiple laboratories.\n\nA chemical synthesis begins by selection of compounds that are known as reagents\nor reactants. Various reaction types can be applied to these to synthesize the\nproduct, or an intermediate product. This requires mixing the compounds in a\nreaction vessel such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask. Many\nreactions require some form of work-up procedure before the final product is\nisolated. Vogel, A.I., Tatchell, A.R., Furnis, B.S., Hannaford,\nA.J. and P.W.G. Smith. Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, 5th\nEdition. Prentice Hall, 1996. ISBN 0-582-46236-3. The amount of product in\na chemical synthesis is the reaction yield. Typically, chemical yields are\nexpressed as a weight in grams or as a percentage of the total theoretical\nquantity of product that could be produced. A 'side reaction' is an unwanted\nchemical reaction taking place that diminishes the yield of the desired product.\n\nThe word synthesis in the present day meaning was first used by the chemist\nHermann Kolbe.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Chemical_synthesis","recorded":1362500819,"links":40,"instances":["chemistry","iii_oxide","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical synthesis|","Chemistry"],"headings":["Strategies","Organic synthesis","Other meanings","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","chemistry"],["work-up","chemistry"],["yield","chemistry"],["iron","iii_oxide"]],"members":["iron","product","yield"],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_reaction","Product_(chemistry)","Physics","Laboratory","Chemical_compound","Reagent","List_of_reactions","Chemical_reactor","Round-bottom_flask","Work-up_(chemistry)","Yield_(chemistry)","Chemical_yield","Gram","Hermann_Kolbe","Reactant","Cascade_reaction","Multi-component_reaction","Telescopic_synthesis","Organic_synthesis","Organic_compound","Total_synthesis","Synthesize","Organic_synthesis","Robert_Burns_Woodward","Nobel_Prize_for_Chemistry","Semisynthetic","Chemical_element","Chemical_compound","Sodium","Chloride","Sodium_chloride","Sulfur","Oxygen","Sulfur_dioxide","Iron","Oxygen","Iron_(III)_oxide","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Carbonic_acid","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Carbonic_acid","Chemical_engineering","Organic_synthesis","Total_synthesis","Peptide_synthesis","Methods_in_Organic_Synthesis","Beilstein_database","Chemical_engineering","Organic_synthesis","Total_synthesis","Peptide_synthesis","Methods_in_Organic_Synthesis","Beilstein_database"]}
