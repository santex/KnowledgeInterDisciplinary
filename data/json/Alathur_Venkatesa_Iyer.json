Venkatesa\nIyer practised Carnatic music in the style of the composer Tyagaraja. Venkatesa\nIyer later developed a unique style that is known as the \"Alathur style\" of\nrendering [[kriti]]s. Venkatesa Iyer was also accomplished in playing the\nharmonium.\n\nIyer gave the world of Carnatic music its star duo of the 20th century, the\nAlathur Brothers. This duo consisted of his son, Sivasubramania Iyer, and\nanother student, Srinivasa Iyer of Aangarai near Tanjore. Following the grand\ntradition set by their guru, the duo excelled in the authentic version of\nCarnatic music bringing together its technicalities to develop a taste for this\npatantara in the audience, both the experts and the laymen, alike. Venkatesa\nIyer accompanied the Alathur Brothers on the harmonium in their first concert,\nwhich was held in 1928 at the Tyagaraja Aradhana at Tiruvaiyaru. Veteran\nmridangam exponent Pudukottai Dakshinamurthy Pillai accompanied them on the\nmridangam on that occasion.\n\nVenkatesa Iyer was a Baktha of Saint Tyagaraja and popularized his krithis in\nlarge numbers.\n\nVenkatesa Iyer was also a great admirer of Muthuswamy Dikshitar's compositions\nand he constructed a memorial for the great composer in Tiruvarur where\nDikshitar's house had stood.\n\nVenkatesa Iyer was instrumental in bringing out a large number of krithis of\nMaharaja Swathi Thirunal of Travancore. He shined and polished rare compositions\nof great composers like Meesu Krishna Iyer of the preceding century. He brought\nsuch compositions out on the concert platform through the Alathur Brothers.\n\nIyer's name is associated with acts such as Kancheepuram Naina Pillai,\nKonerirajapuram Vaidyantha Iyer, Pudukottai Dakshinamurthy Pillai and Pazhani\nMuthiah Pillai, all giants of an earlier era in Carnatic music. He sought out\nthe nuances of their music and taught them to his students. The effect of such a\ntraining is evident in the music of the Alathur Brothers. A strict\ndisciplinarian and an unflinching traditionalist, he taught students such\nSarojini Sundaresan, Trichy J. Venkatraman, Chengelput Ranganathan, Clarinet A.\nK. C. Natarajan, who though numbering few, have in good stead been the torch\nbearers of the Alathur style.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","recorded":1375065534,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Carnatic_music","/wiki/Composer","/wiki/Pump_organ","/wiki/Alathur_Brothers","/wiki/Carnatic_music","/wiki/Tyagaraja","/wiki/Kriti","/wiki/Pump_organ","/wiki/Alathur_Brothers","/wiki/Tanjore","/wiki/Mridangam","/wiki/Dakshinamurthy_Pillai","/wiki/Muthuswamy_Dikshitar","/wiki/Tiruvarur","/wiki/Swathi_Thirunal","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&action=edit&section=1","http://www.raagalaya.org/AlathurStyle.html","http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2008/09/19/stories/2008091950480300.htm","http://tamilelibrary.org/teli/tnmusic2.html","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&oldid=536032209","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Carnatic_singers","/wiki/Category:1895_births","/wiki/Category:1958_deaths","/wiki/Category:Carnatic_composers","/wiki/Category:Carnatic_instrumentalists","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alathur+Venkatesa+Iyer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Alathur+Venkatesa+Iyer","/wiki/Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","/wiki/Talk:Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","#","/wiki/Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&oldid=536032209","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&action=info","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4708821","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&id=536032209","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Alathur+Venkatesa+Iyer","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Alathur+Venkatesa+Iyer&oldid=536032209&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer&printable=yes","#","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4708821#sitelinks-wikipedia","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alathur_Venkatesa_Iyer","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Carnatic
