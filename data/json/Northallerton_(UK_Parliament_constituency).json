{"cursor":"11342","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{UK former constituency infobox|\n | Name = Northallerton Type = Borough Year = 1640 Abolition = 1885\n}}\n\n'Northallerton' was a parliamentary borough in the North Riding of Yorkshire,\nrepresented by two Members of Parliament in the House of Commons briefly in\nthe 13th century and again from 1640 to 1832, and by one member from 1832\nuntil 1885.\n\nThe constituency consisted of the market town of Northallerton, the county\ntown of the North Riding. In 1831 it encompassed only 622 houses and a\npopulation of 3,004. The right to vote was vested in the holders of the\nburgage tenements, of which there were roughly 200 â most of which were ruined\nor consisted only of stables or cowhouses, and had no value except for the\nvote which was attached to them. As in most other burgage boroughs, the\nownership of the burgages had early become concentrated in the hands of a\nsingle family, who in effect had a free hand to nominate both MPs. At the time\nof the Great Reform Act in 1832, the patrons were the Earl of Harewood and\nHenry Peirse, who was the Earl's brother-in-law.\n\nUnder the Reform Act, the boundaries were extended to include neighbouring\nRomanby and Brompton, increasing the population to 4,839, and its representation\nwas reduced to a single member. The Act also, of course, extended the franchise.\n\nAt the 1885 election, the constituency was abolished, being absorbed into the\nnew Richmond division of the North Riding.\n","linknr":202,"url":"Northallerton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","recorded":1375076248,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Northallerton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Northallerton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Borough_constituency","/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1885","/wiki/Parliamentary_borough","/wiki/North_Riding_of_Yorkshire","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","/wiki/Great_Reform_Act","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1885","/wiki/Northallerton","/wiki/Burgage","/wiki/Great_Reform_Act","/wiki/Henry_Lascelles,_2nd_Earl_of_Harewood","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Peirse&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Romanby","/wiki/Brompton,_Hambleton","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1885","/wiki/Richmond_(Yorks)_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","#Members_of_Parliament","#MPs_1640.E2.80.931832","#MPs_1832.E2.80.931885","#References","/w/index.php?title=Northallerton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Northallerton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Long_Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Darley&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Roundheads","/wiki/John_Wastell","/wiki/Roundheads","/wiki/Barebones_Parliament","/wiki/First_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/Second_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/Third_Protectorate_Parliament","/wiki/James_Danby","/w/index.php?title=George_Smithson&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Rump_Parliament","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Darley&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Thomas_Lascelles_(1624%E2%80%931697)","/wiki/Francis_Lascelles","/w/index.php?title=Sir_George_Marwood,_1st_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Sir_Gilbert_Gerard,_1st_Baronet_of_Fiskerton","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=Roger_Talbot&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Henry_Calverley&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sir_David_Foulis,_3rd_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Henry_Marwood,_2nd_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Thomas_Lascelles_(1624%E2%80%931697)","/wiki/Sir_William_Robinson,_1st_Baronet","/wiki/Sir_William_Hustler","/w/index.php?title=Ralph_Milbancke&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Dormer_(MP)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Daniel_Lascelles_(1655%E2%80%931734)","/wiki/John_Aislabie","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Dormer_(MP)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Sir_William_Hustler","/wiki/Roger_Gale_(antiquary)","/w/index.php?title=Robert_Raikes_(1683-1753)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Leonard_Smelt&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Peirse&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Cholmley_Turner&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Peirse&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=William_Smelt&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Henry_Lascelles_(1690-1753)","/wiki/Daniel_Lascelles_(1714-1784)","/wiki/Edwin_Lascelles,_1st_Baron_Harewood","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/wiki/Edward_Lascelles,_1st_Earl_of_Harewood","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Peirse_(younger)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Whig_(British_political_party)","/wiki/Edwin_Lascelles,_1st_Baron_Harewood","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/wiki/Edward_Lascelles,_1st_Earl_of_Harewood","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/w/index.php?title=Edward_Lascelles,_Viscount_Lascelles&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/wiki/John_Bacon_Sawrey_Morritt","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/wiki/Henry_Lascelles,_2nd_Earl_of_Harewood","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/wiki/William_Saunders_Sebright_Lascelles","/wiki/Whig_(British_political_party)","/wiki/Marcus_Beresford_(1800%E2%80%931876)","/wiki/Whig_(British_political_party)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1826","/wiki/Sir_John_Beresford,_1st_Baronet","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/wiki/Henry_Lascelles,_3rd_Earl_of_Harewood","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1831","/wiki/William_Saunders_Sebright_Lascelles","/wiki/British_Tory_Party","/w/index.php?title=Northallerton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1832","/wiki/United_Kingdom_g
