{"cursor":"15779","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Context awareness' is defined complementary to location awareness. Whereas\nlocation may serve as a determinant for resident processes, context may be\napplied more flexibly with mobile computing with any moving entities, especially\nwith bearers of smart communicators. Context awareness originated as a term from\nubiquitous computing or as so-called pervasive computing which sought to deal\nwith linking changes in the environment with computer systems, which are\notherwise static. The term has also been applied to business theory in relation\nto business process management issues. {{cite conference\n| author = Rosemann, M., & Recker, J. year = 2006 title = Context-aware process\n| design: Exploring the extrinsic drivers for process flexibility booktitle =\n| 18th international conference on advanced information systems\nengineering. proceedings of workshops and doctoral consortium\n| pages = 149â158 location = Luxembourg publisher = Namur University Press\n| editor = T.
