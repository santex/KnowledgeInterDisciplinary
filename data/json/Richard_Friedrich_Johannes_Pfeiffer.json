In 1894 he found\nthat live cholera bacteria could be injected without ill effects into guinea\npigs previously immunised against cholera, and that blood plasma from these\nanimals added to live cholera bacteria caused them to become motionless and to\nlyse. This could be inhibited by previously heating the blood plasma. He called\nthis bacteriolysis and it became known as the Pfeiffer Phenomenon, or Isayev-\nPfeiffer phenomenon.\n\nWorking with Robert Koch in Berlin he intellectually and experimentally\nconceived the concept of endotoxin as a heat-stable bacterial poison responsible\nfor the pathophysiological consequences of certain infectious diseases.\nEndotoxin and anti-endotoxin antibodies have since then fascinated researchers\nof many disciplines, particularly in the fields of diagnosis, prevention, and\ntherapy of severe Gram-negative infections.\n\nPfeiffer was a pioneer in typhoid vaccination. He discovered the specific bacteria-\ndissolving immune bodies in cholera and typhus. The British pathologist Almroth\nWright is generally credited with the initiation of typhoid vaccination in 1896.\nHis claims of priority were challenged as early as 1907 in favour of Richard\nPfeiffer. A review of the original literature of the 1890s and the early 1900s\nrevealed that several groups were working on typhoid vaccine at the same time\nand that the credit for the initiation of typhoid vaccine studies should be\nshared by these two great researchers.\n\nIn 1892 he isolated what he thought was the causative agent of influenza. The\nculprit, according to Pfeiffer, was a small rod-shaped bacterium that he\nisolated from the noses of flu-infected patients . He dubbed it Bacillus\ninfluenzae (or Pfeiffer's bacillus), which was later called Haemophilus\ninfluenzae. Few doubted the validity of this discovery, in large part because\nbacteria had been shown to cause other human diseases, including anthrax,\ncholera, and plague.\n\nWhen history's deadliest influenza pandemic began in 1918, most scientists\nbelieved that Pfeiffer's bacillus caused influenza. With the lethality of this\noutbreak (which killed an estimated 20 to 100 million worldwide) came\nurgencyâresearchers around the world began to search for Pfeiffer's bacillus in\npatients, hoping to develop antisera and vaccines that would protect against\ninfection. In many patients, but not all, the bacteria were found. Failures to\nisolate B. influenzae (now known as Haemophilus influenzae) were largely chalked\nup to inadequate technique, as the bacteria were notoriously difficult to\nculture. Barry, J.M. 2004. The Great Influenza. Penguin Books, London,\nEngland. p. 412.\n\nThe first blow to Pfeiffer's theory came from Peter Olitsky and Frederick Gates\nat The Rockefeller Institute. Olitsky and Gates took nasal secretions from\npatients infected with the 1918 flu and passed them through Berkefeld filters,\nwhich exclude bacteria. The infectious agent â which caused lung disease in\nrabbits â passed through the filter, suggesting that it was not a bacterium.

Although the duo had\nperhaps isolated the influenza virus (which they nevertheless referred to as an\natypical bacterium called Bacterium pneumosintes), other researchers could not\nreproduce their results.\n\nIn 1896 he isolated micrococcus catarrhalis that is the cause of laryngitis. M\ncatarrhalis also causes bronchitis, and pneumonia in children and adults with\nunderlying chronic lung disease. It is occasionally a cause of meningitis.\n\nRichard Pfeiffer also invented a universal staining for histological\npreparations.\n\nPfeiffer studied at the Kaiser-Wilhelms-Akademie in Berlin from 1875 to 1879.\nAfter completing his studies he was conferred doctor of medicine in 1880 and\nsubsequently served as an army physician and bacteriologist until 1889. He was a\nstudent of Robert Koch (1843â1910), and from 1887 to 1891 worked as Koch's\nassistant in the Institute of Hygiene in Berlin. In 1891 he was entrusted with\nthe leadership of the scientific department of the Institute of Infectious\nDiseases in Berlin.\n\nIn 1897 Pfeiffer joined the German expedition under Robert Koch to India to\ninvestigate the plague. The following year he went to Italy with Koch to do\nresearch on Malaria. He moved to KÃ¶nigsberg to enter the chair of hygiene in\n1899, succeeding Erwin von Esmarch (1855â1915). He remained in that city until\n1909, when he moved on to the same chair in Breslau. Pfeiffer retired there as\nemeritus in 1925.\n\n Image:LÄdek_ZdrÃ³j,_Richard_Pfeiffer_house.jpg|R.Pfeiffer\"s House\n\"Haimat Sonne\" in LÄdek Zdroj (Bad Landeck), Konopnickiej 5
