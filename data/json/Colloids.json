{"cursor":"30374","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n is an emulsified colloid of liquid butterfat globules dispersed within a water-\n based solution.]] A 'colloid' is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly\n throughout another substance. {{Cite web |publisher = Britannica Online\n Encyclopedia|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125898/colloid\n |title=Colloid|accessdate =31 August 2009}}\n\nA colloidal system consists of two separate phases: a dispersed phase (or\ninternal phase) and a continuous phase (or dispersion medium) in which the\ncolloid is dispersed. A colloidal system may be solid, liquid, or gas.\n\nThe dispersed-phase particles have a diameter of between approximately 1 and\n1000 nanometers. , p. 955 Such particles are normally invisible in an\noptical microscope, though their presence can be confirmed with the use of an\nultramicroscope or an electron microscope. Homogeneous mixtures with a dispersed\nphase in this size range may be called colloidal aerosols, colloidal emulsions,\ncolloidal foams, colloidal dispersions, or hydrosols. The dispersed-phase\nparticles or droplets are affected largely by the surface chemistry present in\nthe colloid.\n\nSome colloids are translucent because of the Tyndall effect, which is the\nscattering of light by particles in the colloid. Other colloids may be opaque or\nhave a slight color.\n\nColloidal solutions (also called colloidal suspensions) are the subject of\ninterface and colloid science. This field of study was introduced in 1861 by\nScottish scientist Thomas Graham.\n","linknr":567,"url":"Colloids","recorded":1362506240,"links":62,"instances":["chemistry","colloid","chemistry","chemistry","botany","physical","crystal_lattice","chemistry","medical","chemistry","chemist","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.nagra.ch/documents/database/dokumente/%24default/Default%20Folder/Publikationen/e%5Fntb02%2D14.pdf","http://www.nagra.ch/documents/database/dokumente/%24default/Default%20Folder/Publikationen/e%5Fntb02%2D14.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical
