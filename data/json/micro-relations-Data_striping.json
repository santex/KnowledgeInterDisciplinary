{"cursor":"4388","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computer data storage, 'data striping' is the technique of segmenting\nlogically sequential data, such as a file, so that consecutive segments are\nstored on different physical storage devices. Striping is useful when a\nprocessing device requests access to data more quickly than a single storage\ndevice can provide. By spreading segments across multiple devices, multiple\nsegments can be accessed concurrently. This provides greater data throughput,\nwhich avoids the processor having to wait for data. Striping is used across disk\ndrives in RAID storage, network interfaces in Grid-oriented Storage, and RAM in\nsome systems.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Data_striping","recorded":1362677572,"links":13,"instances":["information_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data partitioning","RAID"],"headings":["Method","Advantages and disadvantages","Wide Striping and Narrow Striping","Other Applications","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["redundancy","information_theory"]],"members":["redundancy"],"related":["Computer_data_storage","Disk_drive","Redundant_array_of_independent_disks","Network_interface_controller","Grid-oriented_Storage","Random-access_memory","Round-robin","Error_detection_and_correction","Mean_time_between_failures","Parity_bit","Database","Sybase","IBM","IBM_9394_RAMAC_Array","Computer_cluster","Oracle_Corporation","Automatic_Storage_Management","Logical_Volume_Management","Disk_mirroring","Logical_volume","Redundancy_(information_theory)"]}
