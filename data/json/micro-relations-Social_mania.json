{"cursor":"1585","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Social manias' are mass movements which periodically sweep through society,\nsometimes on a world-wide basis. They are characterized by an outpouring of\nenthusiasm, mass involvement and millennialist goals. Social manias are\ncontagious social epidemics, and as such they should be differentiated from\nmania in individuals.\n\nSocial manias come in different sizes and strengths. Some social manias fail to\n'catch fire', while others persist for hundreds of years (although sometimes in\nseverely attenuated form). Common to all is a vision of salvation, a new way of\nlife, which if realized would radically change everyday life, ushering in a new\nworld of freedom and justice.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Social_mania","recorded":1362480274,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Social movements"],"headings":["Examples","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg/40px-Vista_Login_Manager_Cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Society","Enthusiasm","Millennialism","Epidemic","Mania","Salvation","Taiping_Rebellion","Ghost_dance","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","The_Crusades","Moral_panic","Wikinfo"]}
