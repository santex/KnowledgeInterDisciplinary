Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific\nperson, publication, period, or event. 'ÎÎµÎ¿Î»ÎµÎ¾Î¯Î±' (Greek: a \"new word\", or the\nact of creating a new word) is a synonym for it. The term neologism is first\nattested in English in 1772, borrowed from French nÃ©ologisme\n(1734). [[Oxford English Dictionary]], draft revision Dec. 2009,\n[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00322941 s.v.]\n\nIn psychiatry, the term neologism is used to describe the use of words that have\nmeaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common\nmeaning. G E Berrios (2009) Neologisms. History of Psychiatry 20: 480-\n496 This tendency is considered normal in children, but in adults can be a\nsymptom of psychopathy \"Most of us are able to combine ideas so that they\nare consistent with some underlying theme, but psychopaths seem to have\ndifficulty doing so. This helps to explain the wild inconsistencies and\ncontradictions that frequently characterize their speech. It may also account\nfor their use of neologisms (combining the basic components of words --\nsyllables -- in ways that seem logical to them but inappropriate to others).\"\nRobert D.

Additionally, use of neologisms may be related to aphasia acquired\nafter brain damage resulting from a stroke or head injury.

Brain Lang, 1979\n\nIn theology, a neologism is a relatively new doctrine (for example,\nTranscendentalism). In this sense, a neologist is one who proposes either a new\ndoctrine or a new interpretation of source material such as religious\ntexts.
