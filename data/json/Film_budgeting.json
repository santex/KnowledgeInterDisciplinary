This\ndocument, which could be over 150 pages long, is used to secure financing for\nthe film and lead to pre-production and production of the film. Multiple drafts\nof the budget may be required to whittle down costs. A budget is typically\ndivided into four sections: [[above the line (filmmaking)|above the line]]\n(creative talent), [[below the line (filmmaking)|below the line]] (direct\nproduction costs), [[post-production]] (editing, visual effects, etc.), and\nother (insurance, completion bond, etc.). Film financing can be acquired from a\nprivate investor, sponsor, product placement, a film studio or entertainment\ncompany, or out of pocket funds.\n","linknr":297,"url":"Film_budgeting","recorded":1362477587,"links":18,"instances":["commercial"],"pdf":["http://www.demetrimusic.com/filmbudget.pdf"],"categories":["Budgets","Film production"],"headings":["Elements","Tactics for cutting costs","The budget as an advertising tool","Going over budget","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sponsor","commercial"]],"members":["sponsor"],"related":["Budget","Film_production","Insurance","Sponsor_(commercial)","Product_placement","Film_studio","Video_game","Writers_Guild_of_America","Quentin_Tarantino","M._Night_Shyamalan","Screenwriter","Script_doctor","Columbia_Pictures","Film_producer","Executive_producer","Laura_Ziskin","Directors_Guild_of_America","Film_director","Cinematographer","Computer-generated_imagery","Post-production","Industrial_Light_and_Magic","Avatar","The_Lord_of_the_Rings","Film_score","Christina_Aguilera","Kanye_West","David_Bowie","The_Beatles","Led_Zeppelin","Whole_Lotta_Love","Day_for_night","Golden_Gate_Bridge","San_Francisco,_California","San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge","Close-up","Car_chase","Hollywood_accounting","Audit","Litigation","Peter_Jackson","New_Line_Cinema","The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy","United_States_dollar","Directors_Guild_of_America","Writers_Guild_of_America","Screen_Actors_Guild","Hollywood_North","Exchange_rate","Subsidy","Television_production","U.S._state","Movie_production_incentives_in_the_United_States","Czech_Republic","Germany","Australia","New_Zealand","Robert_Latham_Brown","The_Smoking_Gun","Public_domain","List_of_highest-grossing_films","List_of_most_expensive_films","List_of_least_expensive_films","Box_office_bomb","Hollywood_accounting","Film_finance"]}
