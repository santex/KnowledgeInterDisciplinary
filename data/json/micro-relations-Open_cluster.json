{"cursor":"47307","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/En-Open_cluster-article.ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":", an open star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud]]\n\nAn 'open cluster' is a group of up to a few thousand stars that were formed from\nthe same giant molecular cloud and have roughly the same age. More than 1,100\nopen clusters have been discovered within the Milky Way Galaxy, and many more\nare thought to exist. They are loosely bound to each other by\nmutual gravitational attraction and become disrupted by close encounters with\nother clusters and clouds of gas as they orbit the galactic center, resulting in\na migration to the main body of the galaxy as well as a loss of cluster members\nthrough internal close encounters. Open clusters\ngenerally survive for a few hundred million years. In contrast, the more massive\nglobular clusters of stars exert a stronger gravitational attraction on their\nmembers, and can survive for many billions of years. Open clusters have been\nfound only in spiral and irregular galaxies, in which active star formation is\noccurring.\n\nYoung open clusters may still be contained within the molecular cloud from which\nthey formed, illuminating it to create an H II region. Over\ntime, radiation pressure from the cluster will disperse the molecular cloud.\nTypically, about 10% of the mass of a gas cloud will coalesce into stars before\nradiation pressure drives the rest of the gas away.\n\nOpen clusters are key objects in the study of stellar evolution. Because the\ncluster members are of similar age and chemical composition, the effects of\nother stellar properties are more easily determined than they are for isolated\nstars. A number of open clusters, such as the Pleiades, Hyades\nor the Alpha Persei Cluster are visible with the naked eye. Some others, such as\nthe Double Cluster, are barely perceptible without instruments, while many more\ncan be seen using binoculars or telescopes. The Wild Duck Cluster, M11, is an\nexample.\n","linknr":733,"url":"Open_cluster","recorded":1362567006,"links":70,"instances":["star_cluster","constellation","constellation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Star clusters","Open
