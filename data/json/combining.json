descriptively from an affix by its ability to occur as one immediate constituent of a form whose only other immediate constituent is an affix (as '''cephal-''' in '''cephalic''') or by its being derived from an independent word (as '''electro'''- representing '''electric''' in '''electromagnet''' or '''para-''' representing '''parachute''' in '''paratrooper''') or can be distinguished historically from an affix by the fact that it is borrowed from another language in which it is descriptively a word or a combining form (as French '''mal''' giving English '''mal-''' in '''malodorous''').","\n<a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com/Food_combining\">Food combining</a>, in nutrition","\n<a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com/underline\">Combining low line</a>, underline, in
