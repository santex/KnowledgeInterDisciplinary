The name is a corruption of \"Sooth Was\",\nwhich means the \"southern voes\" - as with Kirkwall, it was assumed that it was a\nmispronunciation of \"walls\".\n\nSouth Walls forms the southern side of the harbour of Longhope. It was a tidal\nisland until a narrow causeway, was constructed over the sandbank, which was\nknown as the Ayre, although this name has become transferred to the causeway\nitself. Although sometimes considered to be a peninsula, it is\nan island in all but name.\n\nSouth Walls is a popular stopping off place for Barnacle Geese.\n","linknr":539,"url":"South_Walls","recorded":1362890322,"links":33,"instances":["engineer"],"pdf":["http://www.argyll-yachtcharters.co.uk/Scottish%20Islands.pdf"],"categories":["Islands of the Orkney Islands"],"headings":["Geography and geology","History","Nature reserve","See also","References","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Orkney_Islands_UK_relief_location_map.jpg/240px-Orkney_Islands_UK_relief_location_map.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/6px-Red_pog.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Flag_of_Scotland.svg/42px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Lymphad3.svg/25px-Lymphad3.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Scapa_Flow%28RLH%29.gif/220px-Scapa_Flow%28RLH%29.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Vikings02.jpg/220px-Vikings02.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Hacknessmartello.jpg/220px-Hacknessmartello.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Southwallsradar.jpg/220px-Southwallsradar.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Southwallswireless.jpg/220px-Southwallswireless.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Boreray_and_the_Stacs.jpg/80px-Boreray_and_the_Stacs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["david_stevenson","engineer"]],"members":["david_stevenson"],"related":["Longhope,_Orkney","Mainland_Orkney","Orkney","Hoy","Orkney","Scotland","Kirkwall","Longhope,_Orkney","Barnacle_goose","Old_red_sandstone","Rousay","Longhope,_Orkney","Caithness","Sutherland","Olaf_I_of_Norway","Norway","Sigurd_Hloðvisson","Shaman","Hackness_Martello_Tower_and_Battery","Napoleonic_Wars","World_War_I","Historic_Scotland","David_Stevenson_(engineer)","Thomas_Stevenson","Northern_Lighthouse_Board","Scapa_Flow","Royal_Navy","Hill_farm","Scottish_Wildlife_Trust","Geology_of_Orkney","Gugh"]}
