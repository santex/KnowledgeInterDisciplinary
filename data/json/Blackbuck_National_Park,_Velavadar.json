Hugging the coasts\nof the Gulf of Khambhat on the south, it is spread over an area of\n34.08 kmÂ², which was primarily a \"vidi\" (grassland) of the Maharaja of the\nprincely state of Bhavnagar. On the northern side, it is surrounded by\nwastelands and agriculture fields. The National park has been classified as 4B\nGujarat-Rajwada biotic province of semi-arid bio-geographical zone.\n\nFlat land, dry grasses and herds of antelopes have always attracted visitors to\nthis park which has a unique grassland ecosystem.
