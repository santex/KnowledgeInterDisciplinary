It entails sampling of the chorionic villus\n(placental tissue) and testing it for chromosomal abnormalities, usually with\nFISH or PCR. CVS usually takes place at 10â12 weeks' gestation, earlier than\namniocentesis or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling. It is the preferred\ntechnique before 15 weeks.\n\nCVS was performed for the first time by Italian biologist Giuseppe Simoni,\nscientific director of Biocell Center, in 1983.
