In its most common variant (known as infantile\nTayâSachs disease), it causes a progressive deterioration of nerve cells and of\nmental and physical abilities that commences around six months of age and\nusually results in death by the age of four. The disease occurs when harmful\nquantities of cell membrane components known as gangliosides accumulate in the\nbrain's nerve cells, eventually leading to the premature death of the cells. A\nganglioside is a form of sphingolipid, which makes TayâSachs disease a member of\nthe sphingolipidoses. There is no known cure or treatment.\n\nThe disease is named after the British ophthalmologist Waren Tay, who in 1881\nfirst described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye, and after the\nAmerican neurologist Bernard Sachs of Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, who\ndescribed in 1887 the cellular changes of TayâSachs disease and noted an\nincreased disease prevalence in the Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish\npopulation.\n\nResearch in the late 20th century demonstrated that TayâSachs disease is caused\nby a genetic mutation in the [[HEXA]] gene on (human) chromosome 15. A large\nnumber of HEXA mutations have been discovered, and new ones are still being\nreported. These mutations reach significant frequencies in specific populations.\nFrench Canadians of southeastern Quebec have a carrier frequency similar to that\nseen in Ashkenazi Jews, but carry a different mutation. Cajuns of southern\nLouisiana carry the same mutation that is seen most commonly in Ashkenazi Jews.\nHEXA mutations are rare and are most seen in genetically isolated populations.\nTayâSachs can occur from the inheritance of either two similar, or two\nunrelated, causative mutations in the HEXA gene.\n","linknr":845,"url":"Tay-Sachs_disease","recorded":1362484004,"links":43,"instances":["genetics","biochemistry","epidemiology","biology","genetics","sheep","medication","journal","politics","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/263/34/18563.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/263/34/18563.pdf"],"categories":["Autosomal
