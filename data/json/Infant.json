{"cursor":"25776","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'infant' (from the Latin word infans, meaning \"unable to speak\" or\n\"speechless\") is the very young offspring of a human. When applied to humans,\nthe term is usually considered synonymous with 'baby', but the latter is\ncommonly applied to the young of any animal. When a human child learns to walk,\nthe term [[toddler]] may be used instead.\n\nThe term infant is typically applied to young children between the ages of 1\nmonth and 12 months; however, definitions may vary between birth and 3 years of\nage. A 'newborn' is an infant who is only hours, days, or up to a few weeks old.\nIn medical contexts, newborn or 'neonate' (from Latin, neonatus, newborn) refers\nto an infant in the first 28 days after birth; the term\napplies to premature infants, postmature infants, and full term infants. Before\nbirth, the term [[fetus]] is used.\n","linknr":445,"url":"Infant","recorded":1362485077,"links":91,"instances":["protein","organism"],"pdf":["http://hr.uclahealth.org/workfiles/AgeSpecificSLM-Peds.pdf","http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/4729276218002062427.pdf","http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/4729276218002062427.pdf"],"categories":["Infancy"],"headings":["Physical characteristics","Care and feeding","Infants and the benefits of touch","Infant mortality","Emotional development","Baby and plane travel","Common care issues","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Happiness.jpg/220px-Happiness.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Newborn_baby-1_hour_after.jpg/250px-Newborn_baby-1_hour_after.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Umbilical-newborn.jpg/250px-Umbilical-newborn.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/HumanNewborn.JPG/250px-HumanNewborn.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Breastfeeding01.jpg/150px-Breastfeeding01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Babyimmunization.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["juvenile","organism"],["noggin","protein"]],"members":["noggin","juvenile"],"related":["Latin","Offspring","Human","Juvenile_(organism)","Premature_birth","Full_term","Apgar_score","Uterus","Birth_weight","Breastfeeding","Human_cranium","Fontanel","Noggin_(protein)","Childbirth","Birth_canal","Physician","Lanugo","White_people","Scalp","Bruise","Vernix_caseosa","Antibacterial","Mongolian_spot","Birthmark","Genitals","Witch's_milk","Umbilical_cord","Hospital","Infection","Newborn","Uterus","Pacifier","Vital_parameter","Blood_Pressure","MmHg","Beats_per_minute","Respiratory_rate","Areola","Breastfeeding","Depth_perception","Heart_sounds","Catarrh","Motherese","Meconium","Breastfeeding","Infant_formula","Nipple","Baby_bottle","Wet_nurse","Baby_food","Milk","Diaper","Child_safety_seat","Moro_reflex","Dehydration","Infection","Congenital_disorder","Sudden_infant_death_syndrome","Epidemiology","Health","Public_health","Adaptation","Ethology","Behavior","Attachment_in_children","Social_interaction","Attachment_in_children","Airlines","Asiana_Airlines","Garuda_Indonesia","Delta_Air_Lines","Baby_colic","Bassinet","Infant_bed","Bathing","Cradle_cap","Day_care","Diaper_rash","Infant_formula","Infant_massage","Immunization","Pacifier","Paternal_bond","Teething","Umbilical_cord","Adult_interaction_with_infants","Attachment_in_children","Baby_monitor","Babysitting","Child_development","Child_development_stages","Cord_blood","Cord_blood_bank","Elimination_communication","Infant_vision","Infanticide","Neonatal_jaundice","Maternal_bond","Maternal_health","Neonatology","Organic_baby_products","Parental_leave","Pediatrics","Pregnancy","Prenatal_nutrition_and_birth_weight","Safe-haven_law","Shock_of_birth","University_of_Illinois"]}
