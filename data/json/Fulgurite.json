They are formed when\nlightning with a temperature of at least instantaneously melts silica on a\nconductive surface and fuses grains together; the fulgurite tube is the cooled\nproduct. This process occurs over a period of around one second, and leaves evidence of the lightning path and its dispersion\nover the surface. Fulgurites can also be produced when a high voltage\nelectrical distribution network breaks and the lines fall onto a conductive\nsurface with sand beneath. They are sometimes referred to as petrified\nlightning. The glass formed is called lechatelierite which may also be formed by\nmeteorite impact and volcanic explosions. Because it is amorphous, fulgurite is\nclassified as a mineraloid. Fulgurites can have deep penetrations, sometimes\noccurring as far as below the surface that was struck.\n\nThe tubes can be up to several centimeters in diameter, and meters long. The\nlongest fulgurite to have been found is a little over in length, and was found\nin northern Florida, USA. Their color varies depending\non the composition of the sand they formed in, ranging from black or tan to\ngreen or a translucent white. The interior is normally very smooth or lined with\nfine bubbles; the exterior is generally coated with rough sand particles and is\nporous. They are rootlike in appearance and often show branching or small holes.\nFulgurites occasionally form as glazing on solid rocks (sometimes referred to as\nan exogenic fulgurite).
