This led to gigs at renaissance faires, science\nfiction conventions, and Celtic music festivals as well as parties and weddings\nfor the pair. The group headlined at the Oscar party for [[The Lord of the\nRings: The Return of the King]].\n\nWith the Bardsâ calendar busy, Gunn began producing the duoâs recordings. His\nfirst solo album, Soul of a Harper, appeared in 2004; he then embarked on work\nfor Irish Drinking Songs for Cat Lovers.\n\nThe Brobdingnagian Bards band broke up amicably on September 15, 2008, and Gunn\nplans to pursue a solo career.\n\nAfter the Brobdingnagian Bards disbanded, Gunn began releasing several albums a\nyear with four full-length studio albums released in 2008, three in 2009, and\ntwo in 2010.\n\nHe is also involved in an online resource called the Celtic MP3s Music Magazine.\nThe weekly publication reviews Celtic music of all varieties from Irish\ntraditional music to Celtic rock. Two free, full-length MP3s are offered for\ndownload every week on the site. Marc is one of the few professional podcasters\nproducing five different podcasts each month, the most-popular being the\n'[http://celticmusicpodcast.com/ Irish & Celtic Music Podcast].' Additionally,\nGunn publishes The Bards Crier's Music Marketing and Promotion Tips [[Ezine]], a\nnewsletter that teaches musicians about marketing and promotion, and handles\nwebmaster duties for a variety of sites including the Austin Celtic Association.\nDue to his hard work as a podcaster and promoter of independent Celtic music, he\nhas earned the nickname of \"The Celtfather\" from his fans.\n\nIt is claimed that more than five million MP3s have been downloaded from him;\nover one million of those were for \"Tolkien ([[The Hobbit]] and The Lord of the\nRings).\" The Brobdingnagian Bards were voted âBest Renaissance Menâ in the\nAustin Chronicleâs 2003 Best of Austin poll. In March 2005, The Bards collected\nan Austin Music Award for the Bards as Best Novelty Band, the first time any\nCeltic band has won. Gunnâs solo CD Soul of a Harper won the Best Cover Art\ncategory that year. In 2007, they continued that honor by winning Best None of\nthe Above Band, and in 2008, they won Best Folk Band.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Marc_Gunn","recorded":1375058762,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Marc-Gunn-New-Deal-Cafe-July-2011.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Marc-Gunn-New-Deal-Cafe-July-2011.jpg/220px-Marc-Gunn-New-Deal-Cafe-July-2011.jpg","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Celtic_music","/wiki/Music_of_Ireland","/wiki/Music_of_Scotland","/wiki/Folk_music","/wiki/Renaissance_music","/wiki/Comedy_music","/wiki/Novelty_song","/wiki/Podcaster","http://www.marcgunn.com/","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Podcaster","/wiki/Autoharp","/wiki/Brobdingnagian_Bards","/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin","/wiki/Renaissance_faire","/wiki/Science_fiction_conventions","/wiki/Academy_Awards","/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King","/wiki/Celtic_rock","/wiki/MP3","/wiki/Podcaster","/wiki/Podcasts","http://celticmusicpodcast.com/","/wiki/Ezine","/wiki/Austin_Celtic_Association","/wiki/Nickname","/wiki/Tolkien","/wiki/The_Hobbit","/wiki/Renaissance","/wiki/Austin_Chronicle","#Bibliography","#Discography","#Compilations_produced_and_featured_on","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Breastfed","/wiki/What_Color_Is_Your_Dragon%3F_Folk_Music_with_Delusions_of_Grandeur","/wiki/Heart%27s_Ease:_Instrumental_Autoharp_Music","/wiki/Live_at_the_Cactus_Cafe","/wiki/Worm_Quartet","/wiki/Brobdingnagian_Bards","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit&section=4","#cite_ref-1","http://www.marcgunn.com/jus_da_faq.shtml","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit&section=5","http://www.marcgunn.com/","http://thebardsdotnet.deviantart.com/","http://www.thebards.net/","http://www.celticmp3s.com/","http://www.celticmusicpodcast.com/","http://www.renaissancefestivalmusic.com/","http://www.marcgunn.com/marcsongs/","http://www.pubsong.com/","http://celticmp3s.com/2013/marc-gunn-this-is-your-life/","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&oldid=562587855","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1972_births","/wiki/Category:Living_people","/wiki/Category:Filkers","/wiki/Category:Renaissance_fair_performers","/wiki/Category:Celtic_music","/wiki/Category:American_podcasters","/wiki/Category:Musicians_from_Texas","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Marc+Gunn&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Marc+Gunn","/wiki/Marc_Gunn","/wiki/Talk:Marc_Gunn","#","/wiki/Marc_Gunn","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Marc_Gunn","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Marc_Gunn","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&oldid=562587855","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Marc_Gunn&id=562587855","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Marc+Gunn","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Marc+Gunn&oldid=562587855&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Marc_Gunn&printable=yes","#","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_
