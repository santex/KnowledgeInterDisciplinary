This fundamental invention creates a new type of cyber-\ninsurance, known as incremental data transmission insurance -or- CloudCover.\n\nCloudCover\n\nStephen is the founder of CloudCover, Ltd. (Minneapolis, MN) a cyber-risk\ninsurance management group focused on delivering the underwriting system and\nmethod for electronic privacy and security of data in-transit. Today as founder,\nStephen leads the team that has re-invented the underwriting of in-transit\ndata@risk within cloud computing. Mr Cardot and his team are completing the\ndevelopment on that which is appropriately being readied to real-time\nunderwrite, insure, mitigate risk and address the claims when transmitting\nglobal online data.\n\nCloudCover have developed in-transit data insurance and are entering the cyber-\ninsurance market with a fundamental real-time risk mitigation and risk transfer\nprocess at the elemental packet level. As CloudCover defines the online risk-\ngap and security vulnerabilities within cloud-computing, the ultimate goal is\nto become the standard for insurance when transmitting mobile data throughout\nthe Internet.\n\nTogether with strategic partners, CloudCover is building the infrastructure to\napply incremental underwriting, pricing, billing, and claims adjudication for\ncloud insurance of cyber-risky data assets and a host of public or private cloud-\ncomputing perils. As a result, CloudCover shall acquire the \"big data\" knowledge\nassociated with underwriting the online privacy and security vulnerabilities of\ntransit data. Thus the ultimate goal is to become the standard for insuring when\ntransmitting cloud data, also known as the CloudCover Protocol.\n\nCloudCover Protocol\n\nToday, the underwriting protocol for real-time (in-transit) data insurance is\nuniquely focused on the worldâs first cyber risk-transfer system and method to\ncomprehensively \"underwrite to insure\" real-time information, digital media,\nweb-based payment processing systems, security modernization of health care\nrecords, the safety of financial securities transactions, and other online\ncommerce that involve risks associated with valuable personal identifiable\ninformation (PII) assets.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1996, Mr. Cardot began to develop one of the worldâs first online bank\nprojects and further engaged secure online banking technology over the Internet.\nCardot produced and directed numerous web projects and online product\nintroductions over the Internet 90âs. He worked on numerous Fortune 500 projects\nand incorporated online security web-technologies to solve the very early stages\nof Internet security and privacy. With 30 years of experience in marketing and\ndesign, with an emphasis on web systems and integration, Cardot focused on data\ninsurance over the previous decade. With an extensive background working on some\nof the worldâs most complex online information issues, Cardot was inspired to\npromote effective responsible behavior concerning privacy and security online.\n\nWith so much attention to protect and secure e-commerce with encryption, Cardot\ninitiated U.S. process patents in 1998 to insure the transmission of data over\nthe Internet. This intellectual area was uncharted within the cyber-risk\ninsurance market. The first process patents were published and issued: 2005,\n2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011 respectively. Mr. Cardot has authored numerous\npatents and continues to pioneer real-time data insurance and supporting\ntechnology for in-transit risk to digital assets.\n\nIssued:\n\nSystems and methods for
