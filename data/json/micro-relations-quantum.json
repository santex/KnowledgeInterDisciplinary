Behind this, one finds the fundamental notion\nthat a physical property may be \"quantized,\" referred to as \"the hypothesis of\nquantization\". Wiener, N. (1966). Differential Space, Quantum Systems, and\nPrediction. Cambridge: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press\nThis means that the magnitude can take on only certain discrete values. There is\na related term of quantum number. An example of an entity that is quantized is\nthe energy transfer of elementary particles of matter (called fermions) through\nbosons and of photons.\n\nA photon is a single quantum of light, and is referred to as a \"light quantum\".\nThe energy of an electron bound to an atom orbital (at rest) is said to be\nquantized, which results in the stability of atoms, and of matter in general.\n\nAs incorporated into the theory of quantum mechanics, this is regarded by\nphysicists as part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing\nnature at the infinitesimal level.\n\nNormally quanta are considered to be discrete packets with energy stored in\nthem. Max Planck considered these quanta to be particles that can change\ntheir form (meaning that they can be absorbed and released). This phenomenon\ncan be observed in the case of black body radiation, when it is being heated\nand cooled.\n","linknr":240,"url":"quantum","recorded":1362892136,"links":55,"instances":["physics","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/helios/fachinfo/www/math/edd/helmholtz/R-Mayer.pdf","http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf","http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf"],"categories":["Quantum mechanics"],"headings":["Etymology and discovery","Beyond electromagnetic radiation","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["quantization","physics"],["mole","unit"],["quantization","physics"]],"members":["quantization","mole"],"related":["Physics","Physical_property","Quantization_(physics)","Quantum_number","Energy","Elementary_particles","Matter","Fermions","Bosons","Photons","Electron","Atom","Atomic_orbital","Quantum_mechanics","Max_Planck","Black-body_radiation","Latin","Philipp_Lenard","Hermann_von_Helmholtz","Physicians","Quantum_satis","Julius_von_Mayer","First_law_of_thermodynamics","Albert_Einstein","Radiation","Photons","Wikisource","Radiation","Black-body_radiation","Planck's_law_","German_Physical_Society","Planck_constant","Avogadro's_number","Mole_(unit)","Electrical_charge","Elementary_particle","Graviton","Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics","Magnetic_flux_quantum","Photon","Photon_polarization","Quantal_analysis","Quantization_(physics)","Quantum_cellular_automata","Quantum_channel","Quantum_coherence","Quantum_chromodynamics","Quantum_computer","Quantum_cryptography","Quantum_dot","Quantum_electronics","Quantum_entanglement","Quantum_immortality","Quantum_lithography","Quantum_mechanics","Quantum_number","Quantum_sensor","Quantum_state","Subatomic_particle"]}
