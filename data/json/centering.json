Once the arch is complete, it\nsupports itself, but until the keystone is inserted, it has no strength and\nneeds the centring to keep the voussoirs in their correct relative positions.\n\nThe centring is normally made of wood, which was a relatively straightforward\nstructure in a simple arch or vault, but with more complex shapes, involving\ndouble curvature, such as a small dome or the bottle-shaped flues of the\nkitchens of some Norman-period houses; clay or sand bound by a weak lime mortar\nmix could be used. The shaping of this sort of centring would probably be done\nby eye, perhaps with the help of a template and the stone or brick structure\nlaid against it. On bigger work, like a 19th-century commercial pottery kiln,\nthis was impractical. The structure would be built round a post acting as a\ndatum, and each course of stonework would be set at a distance from the datum as\nmeasured by a stick or string.\n\nOn completion of the intended structure, the centring of whichever sort is\nremoved, and work on pointing and other finishing continued.\n",
