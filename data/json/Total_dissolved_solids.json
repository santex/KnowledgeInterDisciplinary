{"cursor":"11407","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" usually contains higher TDS levels than tap water]]\n\n'Total Dissolved Solids' (often abbreviated 'TDS') is a measure of the combined\ncontent of all inorganic and organic substances contained in a liquid in:\nmolecular, ionized or micro-granular (colloidal sol) suspended form. Generally\nthe operational definition is that the solids must be small enough to survive\nfiltration through a sieve the size of two micrometer. Total dissolved solids\nare normally discussed only for freshwater systems, as salinity comprises some\nof the ions constituting the definition of TDS. The principal application of TDS\nis in the study of water quality for streams, rivers and lakes, although TDS is\nnot generally considered a primary pollutant (e.g. it is not deemed to be\nassociated with health effects) it is used as an indication of aesthetic\ncharacteristics of drinking water and as an aggregate indicator of the presence\nof a broad array of chemical contaminants.\n\nPrimary sources for TDS in receiving waters are agricultural and residential\nrunoff, leaching of soil contamination and point source water pollution\ndischarge from industrial or sewage treatment plants. The most common chemical\nconstituents are calcium, phosphates, nitrates, sodium, potassium and chloride,\nwhich are found in nutrient runoff, general stormwater runoff and runoff from\nsnowy climates where road de-icing salts are applied. The chemicals may be\ncations, anions, molecules or agglomerations on the order of one thousand or\nfewer molecules, so long as a soluble micro- is formed. More exotic and harmful\nelements of TDS are pesticides arising from surface runoff. Certain naturally\noccurring total dissolved solids arise from the weathering and dissolution of\nrocks and soils. The United States has established a secondary water quality\nstandard of 500Â mg/l to provide for palatability of drinking water.\n\nTotal dissolved solids are differentiated from total suspended solids ('TSS'),\nin that the latter cannot pass through a sieve of two micrometers and yet are\nindefinitely suspended in solution. The term \"settleable solids\" refers to\nmaterial of any size that will not remain suspended or dissolved in a holding\ntank not subject to motion, and excludes both TDS and TSS. Settleable\nsolids may include larger particulate matter or insoluble molecules.\n","linknr":299,"url":"Total_dissolved_solids","recorded":1362482269,"links":25,"instances":["colloid","water","pollution","meteorology","electrolytic","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/region03/mtntop/pdf/appendices/d/stream-chemistry/MTMVFChemistryPart1.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental chemistry","Homogeneous chemical mixtures","Rivers","Water pollution"],"headings":["Measurement","Hydrological simulation","Practical implications","Water classification","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Stilles_Mineralwasser.jpg/170px-Stilles_Mineralwasser.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Pyramid_Lake_sat.jpg/220px-Pyramid_Lake_sat.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Bristol.zoo.aquarium.arp.jpg/220px-Bristol.zoo.aquarium.arp.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Daphnia_magna01.jpg/220px-Daphnia_magna01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sol","colloid"],["point_source","pollution"],["conductivity","electrolytic"],["conductivity","electrolytic"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["filter","water"],["spawn","biology"]],"members":["sol","filter","point_source","precipitation","conductivity","spawn"],"related":["Tap_water","Inorganic","Organic_compound","Sol_(colloid)","Water_quality","Stream","River","Lake","Drinking_water","Agriculture","Soil_contamination","Point_source_(pollution)","Water_pollution","Sewage_treatment","Calcium","Phosphate","Nitrate","Sodium","Potassium","Chloride","Nutrient","Stormwater","De-icing","Cation","Anion","Molecule","Pesticide","Surface_runoff","United_States","Total_suspended_solids","Gravimetry","Conductivity_(electrolytic)","Solvent","Electrical_current","EC_meter","TDS_meter","Conductivity_(electrolytic)","Concentration","Nevada","Truckee_River","Land_use","Topography","Soil","Vegetation","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Fertilizer","Catchment_basin","DSSAM","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Total_Maximum_Daily_Load","England","Hard_water","Valve","Filter_(water)","Aquarium","Destination_spa","Swimming_pool","Reverse_osmosis","Water_treatment","Hydroponics","Aquaculture","Organism","Oyster","Trout","Seafood","PH","Species","Aesthetic","Odor","Color","Leuciscinae","Population","Food_chain","Plankton","Crustacean","Spawn_(biology)","Fish","Striped_bass","San_Francisco_Bay","Truckee_River","Lahontan_cutthroat_trout","Thermal_pollution","Stressor","Turbidity","Dissolved_oxygen","Fresh_water","Brackish_water","Saline_water","Acid_rain","Surface_runoff","TDS_meter"]}
