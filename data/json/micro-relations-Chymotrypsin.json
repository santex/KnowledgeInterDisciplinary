Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves\npeptide amide bonds where the carboxyl side of the amide bond (the P 1\nposition) is a tyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine. These amino acids contain\nan aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a 'hydrophobic pocket' (the\nS 1 position) of the enzyme. It is activated in the presence of\ntrypsin. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate\nP 1 sidechain and the enzyme S 1 binding cavity accounts for\nthe substrate specificity of this enzyme. Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in\npeptides at slower rates, particularly those containing leucine and methionine\nat the P 1 position.\n","linknr":400,"url":"Chymotrypsin","recorded":1362484420,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.4.21","Enzymes","Peptidase"],"headings":["Activating chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin","Action and kinetics of chymotrypsin","Isozymes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/ce/ChymotrypsinA1.jpg/220px-ChymotrypsinA1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Mechanismus.gif/450px-Mechanismus.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bos_taurus","Enzyme","Pancreatic_juice","Duodenum","Proteolysis","Tyrosine","Tryptophan","Phenylalanine","Amino_acid","Aromatic","Substituent","Hydrophobe","Enzyme_substrate","Leucine","Methionine","Pancreas","Protein_biosynthesis","Chymotrypsinogen","Trypsin","Peptide","Disulfide_bond","Hydrolysis","Tryptophan","Tyrosine","Phenylalanine","Leucine","Methionine","Sequence_of_proteases_-_chymotrypsin_A_-_trypsin_-_elastase","Histidine","Aspartic_acid","Catalytic_triad","4-Nitrophenol","Michaelis-Menten_kinetics","Chymotrypsin-C","Chymotrypsin-C","MEROPS"]}
