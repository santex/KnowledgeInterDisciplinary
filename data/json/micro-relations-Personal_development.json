The concept is not limited to self-help but includes formal and\ninformal activities for developing others in roles such as teacher, guide,\ncounselor, manager, life coach or mentor. When personal development takes place\nin the context of institutions, it refers to the methods, programs, tools,\ntechniques, and assessment systems that support human development at the\nindividual level in organizations. Bob Aubrey, Managing Your Aspirations:\nDeveloping Personal Enterprise in the Global Workplace McGraw-Hill 2010 ISBN 978-0-07-131178-\n6, page 9 \n\nAt the level of the individual, personal development includes the following\nactivities:\n\n* improving self-awareness\n* improving self-knowledge\n* building or renewing identity\n* developing strengths or talents\n* improving wealth\n* spiritual development\n* identifying or improving potential\n* building employability or human capital\n* enhancing lifestyle or the quality of life\n* improving health\n* fulfilling aspirations\n* initiating a life enterprise or personal autonomy\n* defining and executing personal development plans\n* improving social abilities\n\nThe concept covers a wider field than self-development or self-help: personal\ndevelopment also includes developing other people. This may take place through\nroles such as those of a teacher or mentor, either through a personal competency\n(such as the skill of certain managers in developing the potential of employees)\nor a professional service (such as providing training, assessment or coaching).\n\nBeyond improving oneself and developing others, personal development is a field\nof practice and research. As a field of practice it includes personal\ndevelopment methods, learning programs, assessment systems, tools and\ntechniques. As a field of research, personal development topics increasingly\nappear in scientific journals, higher education reviews, management journals and\nbusiness books.\n\nAny sort of development â whether economic, political, biological,\norganizational or personal â requires a framework if one wishes to know whether\nchange has actually occurred. In the case of personal development, an individual\noften functions as the primary judge of improvement, but validation of objective\nimprovement requires assessment using standard criteria. Personal development\nframeworks may include goals or benchmarks that define the end-points,\nstrategies or plans for reaching goals, measurement and assessment of progress,\nlevels or stages that define milestones along a development path, and a feedback\nsystem to provide information on changes.\n","linknr":463,"url":"Personal_development","recorded":1362477574,"links":27,"instances":["human_resources","sociology","psychology","disambiguation","philosophy","journal","psychology","social_science","sport"],"pdf":["http://www.livskvalitet.org/cms.ashx/Videnskabelige%20Artikler/~Quality%20of%20Life/qoltheo3.pdf","http://www.livskvalitet.org/cms.ashx/Videnskabelige%20Artikler/~Quality%20of%20Life/qoltheo3.pdf","http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/EQUIS/equis_standards_criteria.pdf"],"categories":["Personal development|"],"headings":["The personal development industry","Origins","Contexts","Criticism","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["self-knowledge","psychology"],["identity","social_science"],["lifestyle","sociology"],["human_relations","journal"],["workshop","disambiguation"],["wushu","sport"],["lifestyle","sociology"],["self","psychology"],["personal_identity","philosophy"],["competence","human_resources"]],"members":["competence","lifestyle","self","workshop","personal_identity","human_relations","identity","wushu"],"related":["Self-help","Individual","Self-awareness","Self-knowledge_(psychology)","Identity_(social_science)","Skill","Human_potential_movement","Human_capital","Lifestyle_(sociology)","Quality_of_life","Personal_development_planning","Social_cognition","Industry","Human_Relations_(journal)","British_Psychological_Society","Australian_Psychological_Society","Business-to-consumer","Business-to-business","Consumer-to-business","Consumer-to-consumer","Physical_fitness","Cosmetology","Weight_loss","Yoga","Martial_arts","Meditation","Tool","Motivational_speaker","E-Learning","Workshop_(disambiguation)","List_of_counseling_topics","Life_coaching","Effectiveness","Management","Work-life_balance","Business_school","Management_service","Training_and_development","Personal-development_tool","Self-assessment","Feedback","Mentoring","Management_consulting","FranklinCovey","Hewitt_Associates","Watson_Wyatt_Worldwide","Hay_Group","McKinsey_&_Company","Boston_Consulting_Group","Korn/Ferry","Executive_coaching","Abrahamic_religions","Indian_religions","New_Age","Prayer","Music","Dance","Singing","Chanting","Poetry","Writing","Sport","Martial_arts","Meaning_of_life","The_good_life","Philosophy","Michel_Foucault","India","Wushu_(sport)","T'ai_chi_ch'uan","Qi","Meditation","Martial_arts","Traditional_Chinese_medicine","Acupuncture","Prayer","Qur'an","Hajj","Sawm_of_ramadan","Tazkiah","The_ScientificWorldJournal","Aristotle","Phronesis","Economics_of_human_development","Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences","Positive_psychology","Confucius","Management","Psychology","Psychoanalysis","Alfred_Adler","Carl_Jung","Lifestyle_(sociology)","Self_image","Work-life_balance","Individuation","Self_(psychology)","Psychological_differentiation","Daniel_Levinson","Developmental_stage_theories","Personal_life","Biological_life_cycle","Albert_Bandura","Self-efficacy","Self-confidence","Martin_Seligman","American_Psychological_Association","Wilhelm_von_Humboldt","Humboldt_University_of_Berlin","Arthur_Chickering","Chickering's_theory_of_identity_development","Skill","Emotion","Autonomy","Interdependence","Interpersonal_relationship","Personal_identity_(philosophy)","Integrity","Dearing_Report","Business_school","Leadership","Career","European_Foundation_for_Management_Development","Business_school","Leadership","Entrepreneurship","Education","Psychology","Sociology","Economics","Philosophy","Abraham_Maslow","Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs","Self_actualization","Self-actualization","Moral_responsibility","Peter_Drucker","Knowledge_worker","Sumantra_Ghoshal","Career_development","Employment","Employee_benefit","Employee_benefit","Work-life_balance","Time_management","Stress_management","Health","Counseling","Neuro-linguistic_programming","Human_capital","Productivity","Talent_management","Leadership","Personal_effectiveness","Management","Personal_development_planning","Competence_(human_resources)","360-degree_feedback","Coaching","End-of-history_illusion","Holland_Codes","Know_thyself","Life_planning","Self-actualization","Self-help","Training_and_development","Human_Potential_Movement","Micropsychoanalysis"]}
