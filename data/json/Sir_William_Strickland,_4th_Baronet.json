{"cursor":"5756","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sir William Strickland' (c. 1686 â 1 September 1735) was an English Member of\nParliament (MP) and Government Minister in Sir Robert Walpole's administration.\n\nStrickland was the eldest son of Sir William Strickland of Boynton, a Yorkshire\nlandowner and Member of Parliament, and his wife Elizabeth Palmes.\n\nIn 1708 Strickland's father, who for some years had been MP for the local\nborough of Malton, was instead chosen as Member for Yorkshire â a much more\nprestigious constituency â and Strickland took his place representing Malton. He\nremained MP for Malton until 1715, then represented Carlisle from 1715 to 1722\nand finally Scarborough for the remaining thirteen years of his life. He\ninherited the baronetcy on his father's death in 1724. From the first he was a\nloyal Whig, recognised as a strong speaker and becoming a friend of Robert\nWalpole. He held a succession of junior posts. He was a Lord of the Treasury\nfrom 1725 to 1727, and also became Treasurer of the Household to the Queen. In\n1729 he chaired a Parliamentary Committee on reform of the legal profession.\n\nIn 1730, when Walpole reconstructed his government and promoted Henry Pelham to\nbe Paymaster-General, Strickland was chosen to take his place as Secretary at\nWar (arguably the most important ministerial post outside the cabinet), and was\nmade a Privy Counsellor. This post he held until forced to retire by ill health\nin May 1735; he died later the same year at Boynton.\n\nAway from Parliament, Sir William spent a considerable sum on ambitious\nalterations to his home, Boynton Hall, commissioning Lord Burlington to design a\nnew frontage and William Kent to design the interiors. However, when he returned\nfrom London to view the work he found to his fury that the local builders had\nfailed to follow Lord Burlington's instructions and the rebuilt hall bore little\nresemblance to the plans, in particular having an \"old-fashioned roof\" instead\nof the fashionable Palladian style he had been expecting!\n\nHe married Catherine Sambrooke, daughter of Sir Jeremy Sambrooke, and they had\none son â George, who succeeded him in the baronetcy â and one daughter. His\nwife outlived him by more than thirty years, dying on 9 February 1767.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet","recorded":1375067180,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/William_Strickland_(disambiguation)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Robert_Walpole","/wiki/Sir_William_Strickland,_3rd_Baronet","/wiki/Boynton,_East_Riding_of_Yorkshire","/wiki/Yorkshire","/wiki/Malton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Yorkshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Carlisle_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Scarborough_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/British_Whig_Party","/wiki/Lord_of_the_Treasury","/wiki/Treasurer_of_the_Household","/wiki/Henry_Pelham","/wiki/Paymaster-General","/wiki/Secretary_at_War","/wiki/Cabinet_(government)","/wiki/Privy_Counsellor","/wiki/Richard_Boyle,_3rd_Earl_of_Burlington","/wiki/William_Kent","/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Sambrooke&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sir_George_Strickland,_5th_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet&action=edit&section=1","http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage.htm","/wiki/Wikipedia:V#SELF","/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS","/wiki/Henry_Pelham","/wiki/Secretary_at_War","/wiki/William_Yonge","/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Sir_William_Strickland,_3rd_Baronet","/wiki/William_Palmes","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Malton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/William_Palmes","/wiki/Thomas_Watson-Wentworth","/wiki/Thomas_Watson-Wentworth","/wiki/Thomas_Watson-Wentworth,_1st_Marquess_of_Rockingham","/wiki/Thomas_Stanwix","/w/index.php?title=Sir_Christopher_Musgrave,_5th_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Carlisle_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Thomas_Stanwix","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Aglionby&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Henry_Aglionby&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=James_Bateman_(MP)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/John_Hungerford_(MP)","/w/index.php?title=William_Thompson_(died_1744)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Scarborough_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/John_Hungerford_(MP)","/w/index.php?title=William_Thompson_(died_1744)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Thomas_Hay,_9th_Earl_of_Kinnoull","/w/index.php?title=William_Thompson_(died_1744)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/List_of_extant_baronetcies","/wiki/Sir_William_Strickland,_3rd_Baronet","/wiki/Strickland_Baronets","/w/index.php?title=Sir_George_Strickland,_5th_Baronet&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet&oldid=528465213","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1680s_births","/wiki/Category:1735_deaths","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Privy_Council_of_Great_Britain","/wiki/Category:Baronets_in_the_Baronetage_of_England","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Parliament_of_Great_Britain_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Whig_(British_political_party)_MPs","/wiki/Category:People_from_Yorkshire","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1708%E2%80%931710","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1710%E2%80%931713","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1713%E2%80%931715","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1715%E2%80%931722","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1722%E2%80%931727","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1727%E2%80%931734","/wiki/Category:British_MPs_1734%E2%80%931741","/wiki/Category:Accuracy_disputes_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_factual_verification","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_factual_verification_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_incorporating_an_LRPP-Bt_template_without_an_unnamed_parameter","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_March_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sir+William+Strickland%2C+4th+Baronet&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Sir+William+Strickland%2C+4th+Baronet","/wiki/Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet","/wiki/Talk:Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet","#","/wiki/Sir_William_Strickland,_4th_Baronet","/w/index.php?title=Sir_William_Strickland,_4t
