Most of the areas below sea level are man-made, caused by\ncenturies of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction, lowering the\nsurface by several meters. Even in flooded areas peat extraction continued\nthrough turf dredging. From the late 16th century land reclamation started and\nlarge polder areas are now preserved through elaborate drainage systems with\ndikes, canals and pumping stations. Much of the Netherlands is formed by the\nestuary of three important European rivers, which together with their\ndistributaries form the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta. Most of the country is very\nflat, with the exception of foothills in the far southeast and several low hill\nranges in the central parts.\n\nThe Netherlands was one of the first countries to have an elected parliament,\nand the country is a founding member of the EU, NATO, OECD, WTO and a part of\nthe trilateral Benelux economic union. The Netherlands had the tenth-highest per\ncapita income in the world in 2011. The country is host to the Organization for\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and five international courts: the Permanent\nCourt of Arbitration, the International Court of Justice, the International\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Court\nand the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The first four are situated in The Hague,\nas is the EU's criminal intelligence agency Europol and judicial co-operation\nagency Eurojust. This has led to the city being dubbed \"the world's legal\ncapital\".<ref>, specifically, \"In the 1990s, during his term as United Nations\nSecretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali started calling The Hague the world's\nlegal capital.\"</ref> The Netherlands has a market-based mixed economy, ranking\n17th of 177 countries according to the Index of Economic Freedom.<ref>[http://w-\neb.archive.org/web/20130510115657/http://www.heritage.org/index/country/netherl-\nands Netherlands], Index of Economic Freedom. heritage.org</ref> In May 2011,\nthe
