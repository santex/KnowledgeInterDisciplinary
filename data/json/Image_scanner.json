Common examples found in offices are variations\nof the desktop (or flatbed) scanner where the document is placed on a glass\nwindow for scanning. Hand-held scanners, where the device is moved by hand, have\nevolved from text scanning \"wands\" to 3D scanners used for industrial design,\nreverse engineering, test and measurement, orthotics, gaming and other\napplications. Mechanically driven scanners that move the document are typically\nused for large-format documents, where a flatbed design would be impractical.\n\nModern scanners typically use a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a Contact Image\nSensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a\nphotomultiplier tube as the image sensor. A rotary scanner, used for high-speed\ndocument scanning, is another type of drum scanner, using a CCD array instead of\na photomultiplier. Other types of scanners are planetary scanners, which take\nphotographs of books and documents, and 3D scanners, for producing three-\ndimensional models of objects.\n\nAnother category of scanner is digital camera scanners, which are based on the\nconcept of reprographic cameras. Due to increasing resolution and new features\nsuch as anti-shake, digital cameras have become an attractive alternative to\nregular scanners. While still having disadvantages compared to traditional\nscanners (such as distortion, reflections, shadows, low contrast), digital\ncameras offer advantages such as speed, portability and gentle digitizing of\nthick documents without damaging the book spine. New scanning technologies are\ncombining 3D scanners with digital cameras to create full-color, photo-realistic\n3D models of objects.\n\nIn the biomedical research area, detection devices for DNA microarrays are\ncalled scanners as well. These scanners are high-resolution systems (up to\n1 Âµm/ pixel), similar to microscopes. The detection is done via CCD or a\nphotomultiplier tube (PMT).\n","linknr":471,"url":"Image_scanner","recorded":1362675476,"links":88,"instances":["photography"],"pdf":["http://www.photopia.co.kr/equipment/comparison.pdf","http://www.photopia.co.kr/equipment/comparison.pdf"],"categories":["Image
