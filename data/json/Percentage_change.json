{"cursor":"13963","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In any quantitative science, the terms 'relative change' and 'relative\ndifference' are used to compare two quantities while taking into account the\n\"sizes\" of the things being compared. The comparison is expressed as a ratio and\nis a unitless number. By multiplying these ratios by 100 they can be expressed\nas percentages so the terms 'percentage change', 'percent(age) difference', or\n'relative percentage difference' are also commonly used. The distinction between\n\"change\" and \"difference\" depends on whether or not one of the quantities being\ncompared is considered a standard or reference or starting value. When this\noccurs, the term relative change (with respect to the reference value) is used\nand otherwise the term relative difference is preferred. Relative difference is\noften used as a quantitative indicator of quality assurance and quality control\nfor repeated measurements where the outcomes are expected to be the same. A\nspecial case of percent change (relative change expressed as a percentage)\ncalled percent error occurs in measuring situations where the reference value is\nthe accepted or actual value (perhaps theoretically determined) and the value\nbeing compared to it is experimentally determined (by measurement).\n","linknr":172,"url":"Percentage_change","recorded":1362685199,"links":16,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.physics.ncsu.edu/courses/pylabs/205N_208N_MeasurementandErrors.pdf","http://www.physics.ncsu.edu/courses/pylabs/205N_208N_MeasurementandErrors.pdf","http://www.phy.ilstu.edu/slh/Percent%20Difference%20Error.pdf","http://www.phy.ilstu.edu/slh/Percent%20Difference%20Error.pdf"],"categories":["Measurement","Numerical analysis","Statistical ratios"],"headings":["Definitions","Formulas","Percent error","Percentage change","Other change units","Examples","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/e/5ae7da05ce823a54a71f7b767958f9ed.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/4/6/9463f569e4f711d850ad1b2d415506d9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/6/d/e6ddac89cb647a916128f580b5c00558.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/7/8678bdff0273f1675ff9aa9e36ffe8d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/b/1/9b18523f38af17fb2fa41ea93eac32ae.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/3/5c37c2f40d1924dc790d0f9755688877.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/d/69db2c70917a859daaf5d591959405b8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/c/9/6c9379b6b8bfee0800888af6cdaacec6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/1/c/51cf480f7405ecbc233b7ce44a8f9119.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/a/8/4a88d079b19427bccb59f37ea7b81bcd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/6/1a6b8b54ddf9b4dccfa571682cda81d1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/d/0/4d03e74d940a6755d02550f9506ef110.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fraction","mathematics"],["equality","mathematics"]],"members":["equality","fraction"],"related":["Quantitative_science","Quantities","Ratio","Unitless","Number","Percentage","Quality_assurance","Quality_control","Percent_error","Absolute_difference","Unitless","Fraction_(mathematics)","Absolute_difference","Ratio","Maximum","Floating_point","Programming_language","Equality_(mathematics)","Approximation_error","Absolute_value","Subtraction","Ratio","Arithmetic_mean","Theory_of_relativity","Numerator","Commutative","Percentage_point","Relative_difference","Absolute_difference","Units_of_measurement","Neper","Neper","Percent","Percentage_points","Genderless","Martians","Earthling","Approximation_error","Errors_and_residuals_in_statistics","North_Carolina_State_University"]}
