The band was formed in May 1988 by\n\n* Dominic Stones — drums,\n* Denise Roughan — bass, keyboards, tambourine, vocals\n* David Saunders — guitar, vocals\n\nThe band's name referred to the members names all starting with \"D\". In 1989\nthey were joined by another \"D\",\n\n* David Mitchell — guitar, mandolin, vocals\n\nSoon after the three became four they ventured out to play some live shows.\nThese were mainly improvised songs, short sets and a Neil Young cover. The idea\nwas to make a crazy, riffy, stick in your head noise, and to have fun. Three of\nthe group were neighbours. All had been in other New Zealand bands, Stones was\nin Bird Nest Roys and Snapper and Roughan had been in Look Blue Go Purple.\nMitchell had been in Goblin Mix and The Exploding Budgies and Saunders in the\nteen-folk band The Battling Strings. The band believed that making music ought\nto be about friends getting together, an attitude they maintained throughout\ntheir time together.\n\nIn 1992 the band played with Nirvana in New Zealand. This was followed by a\nbrief tour of the United States supporting their first album [[Hellzapoppin]]\nand performing at the CMJ New Music Festival in NYC. In 1994 they toured\nAustralia and also returned to the United States in support of their second\nalbum, 'The Venus Trail' released on Merge Records. The release of The 3Ds\nmusic on Merge Records had come about when Superchunk and The 3Ds played\ntogether on the 3Ds first trip to the States. The Venus Trail tour also took\nthe band to the UK for the first time, where they played a sold out debut show,\nwere awarded 'Band of the week' in Melody Maker, 'Album of the week' in the\nNME, and also recorded a John Peel session. Following the UK shows the band\nreturned to the USA to tour extensively with Pavement, Superchunk, and Guided\nBy Voices amongst others.\n\nThe 3Ds returned the favor to Pavement, Superchunk, and Portastatic, touring\nwith them in NZ and Australia when the US bands made their first footsteps 'down\nunder'. Following this, The 3Ds played two stadium shows supporting U2 on their\nZoo TV tour in New Zealand at the personal request of the Irish super-group.\nAnother tour of Australia performing main-stage on The Big Day Out series of\nshows followed along with many more great shows in NZ and Australia up to the\nsummer of '97.\n\nThe distinctive cover art on the band's albums was designed by Mitchell,\nwho is also a graphic artist. The cover of The Venus Trail was drawn by him\nleft-handed.\n\nThe band drifted apart after releasing their third album, [[Strange News from\nthe Angels]], in 1997. Mitchell and Roughan soon moved to London, where they\nwent on to form the Ghost Club.\n\nIn July 2009 The 3Ds got together to play two shows at the Merge Records 20th\nanniversary festival held in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. A documentary film of\nthe festival at the Cats Cradle is planned. In 2010 the 3Ds toured New Zealand,\nincluding the inaugural Laneways festival in New Zealand. This was followed by\nan invitation to play the Pavement curated All Tomorrows Parties festival in the\nUK. The groups out of print albums have been made available again by the\nresurrected Flying Nun label. Future plans are uncertain.\n","linknr":183,"url":"The_3Ds","recorded":1375081340,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cext.uls.nojs%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/3ds_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","/wiki/Talk:The_3Ds","/wiki/File:The_3Ds,_at_the_Windmill,_Blenheim_Gardens_(Brixton,_London).jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/The_3Ds%2C_at_the_Windmill%2C_Blenheim_Gardens_%28Brixton%2C_London%29.jpg/220px-The_3Ds%2C_at_the_Windmill%2C_Blenheim_Gardens_%28Brixton%2C_London%29.jpg","/wiki/Dunedin","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Music_genre","/wiki/Rock_music","/wiki/Pop_music","/wiki/Indie_(music)","/wiki/Ghost_Club","/wiki/Dunedin","/wiki/New_Zealand","/w/index.php?title=Dominic_Stones&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Drum","/w/index.php?title=Denise_Roughan&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bass_guitar","/wiki/Tambourine","/wiki/Vocals","/w/index.php?title=David_Saunders_(musician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Guitar","/wiki/Vocals","/w/index.php?title=David_Mitchell_(musician)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Guitar","/wiki/Mandolin","/wiki/Vocals","/wiki/Neil_Young","/wiki/Bird_Nest_Roys","/wiki/Snapper_(band)","/wiki/Look_Blue_Go_Purple","/w/index.php?title=Goblin_Mix&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=The_Exploding_Budgies&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Nirvana_(band)","/wiki/Hellzapoppin","/w/index.php?title=CMJ_New_Music_Festival&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/The_Venus_Trail","/wiki/Merge_Records","/wiki/Merge_Records","/wiki/Superchunk","/wiki/Melody_Maker","/wiki/NME","/wiki/John_Peel","/wiki/Pavement_(band)","/wiki/Superchunk","/wiki/Guided_By_Voices","/wiki/Portastatic","/wiki/U2","/wiki/The_Big_Day_Out","/wiki/Left-handed","/wiki/Strange_News_from_the_Angels","/wiki/Ghost_Club","/wiki/Merge_Records","/wiki/Pavement_(band)","/wiki/All_Tomorrows_Parties","/wiki/Flying_Nun","#Discography","#Albums","#EPs","#Featured_appearances","#Singles","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/RIANZ","#cite_note-charts-1","/wiki/Fish_Tales/Swarthy_Songs_for_Swabs","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/Hellzapoppin%27_(album)","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/The_Venus_Trail","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/Strange_News_from_the_Angels","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/RIANZ","#cite_note-charts-1","/wiki/Fish_Tales","/wiki/Dunedin","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/Swarthy_Songs_For_Swabs","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/Beautiful_Things_(The_3Ds_EP)","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/Caterwauling_(The_3Ds_EP)","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Abbasalutely","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/Topless_Women_Talk_About_Their_Lives_(soundtrack)","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/wiki/Scarfies_(soundtrack)","/wiki/Flying_Nun_Records","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_New_Zealand","#cite_note-charts-1","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-charts_1-0","#cite_ref-charts_1-1","#cite_ref-charts_1-2","http://charts.org.nz/showinterpret.asp?interpret=3Ds","/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&action=edit&section=7","http://www.flyingnun.co.nz/","http://www.myspace.com/3dsnz","http://www.mergerecords.com/","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CentralAutoLogin/start&type=1x1&from=enwiki","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_3Ds&oldid=557105394","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:New_Zealand_indie_rock_groups","/wiki/Category:Flying_Nun_Records_artists","/wiki/Category:Dunedin_Sound","/wiki/Category:Merge_Records_artists","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1988","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_possible_conflicts_of_interest_from_September_2009","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_hCards","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+3Ds&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+3Ds","/wiki/The_3Ds"
