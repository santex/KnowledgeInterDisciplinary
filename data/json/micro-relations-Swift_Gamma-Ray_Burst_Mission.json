Swift is managed by the NASA\nGoddard Space Flight Center, and was developed by an international consortium\nfrom the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. It is part of NASA's Medium\nExplorer Program (MIDEX).\n","linknr":739,"url":"Swift_Gamma-Ray_Burst_Mission","recorded":1362268022,"links":54,"instances":["astronomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Space telescopes","Unmanned spacecraft","Gamma-ray telescopes","X-ray telescopes","Ultraviolet telescopes","Explorer program","2004 in spaceflight","Spacecraft launched by Delta II rockets"],"headings":["Overview","Instruments","Mission goals","Mission history","Notable detections","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Swift_spacecraft.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/M101_combined_low.jpg/220px-M101_combined_low.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg/70px-NASA_logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["first_light","astronomy"]],"members":["first_light"],"related":["NASA","Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","General_Dynamics","UTC","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station_Space_Launch_Complex_17","Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station","Delta_II","Gamma_ray","X-ray","Ultraviolet","Visible_spectrum","Coded_aperture","Robotic_spacecraft","UTC","Delta_II","Expendable_launch_vehicle","NASA","Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","United_States","United_Kingdom","Italy","Wavelength","Space_observatory","Gamma-ray_burst","Gamma-ray","X-ray","Ultraviolet","Optical","Momentum_wheel","Swift","State_College,_Pennsylvania","Pennsylvania_State_University","Broglio_Space_Centre","Malindi","Kenya","Italian_Space_Agency","Goddard_Space_Flight_Center","Washington_D.C.","University_of_Leicester","General_Dynamics","Orbital_Sciences","Coordinate","Steradian","Arc-minute","Second","Coded_aperture","Lead","Cadmium_zinc_telluride","KeV","Spectroscopy","Arcsecond","Wolter_telescope","Charge-coupled_device","XMM-Newton","KeV","Nanometre","Grism","XMM-Newton","2005_YU55","Hypernova","Universe","Light-years","Supernova","University_of_Leicester","Penn_State_University","First_light_(astronomy)","GRB_050509B","GRB_050904","Redshift","Light-year","GRB_060218","Light-year","Supernova","GRB_060614","Light_year","GRB_060505","NGC_2770","SN_2008D","Type_Ib_and_Ic_supernovae","Hubble_Space_Telescope","Chandra_X-ray_Observatory","Very_Large_Array","Gemini_North","Gemini_South","Keck_I","Hale_telescope","Palomar_Observatory","Apache_Point_Observatory","Alicia_Soderberg","Rosetta_Stone","Hanny's_Voorwerp","IC_2497","GRB_080319B","Light-year","SN_2005ap","Arthur_C._Clarke","GRB_080913","GRB_090423","GRB_090423","GRB_090429B","GRB_110328A","Joshua_Bloom","University_of_California","Berkeley,_California"]}
