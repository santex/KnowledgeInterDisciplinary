In both common law and civil law legal\nsystems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is\ngenerally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims\nbefore a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the\nright to present a defense before a court.\n\nThe system of courts that interpret and apply the law are collectively known as\nthe judiciary. The place where a court sits is known as a venue. The room where\ncourt proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a\ncourthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in\nrural communities to large buildings in cities.\n\nThe practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (Latin\njus dicere) -- the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or\npetitions put to it. According to William Blackstone's [[Commentaries on the\nLaws of England]], a court is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the\nactor or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the reus or defendant, who\nis called upon to make satisfaction for it, and the judex or judicial power,\nwhich is to examine the truth of the fact, to determine the law arising upon\nthat fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, to ascertain and by its\nofficers to apply a legal remedy. It is also usual in the superior courts to\nhave attorneys, and advocates or counsel, as\nassistants, [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk3ch3.asp\nBlackstone's Commentaries, Book III., Ch. 3., p. 25],\n[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/default.asp Yale Law School, Avalon Project]\nthough, often, courts consist of additional attorneys, bailiffs, reporters, and\nperhaps a jury.\n\nThe term \"the court\" is also used to refer to the presiding officer or\nofficials, usually one or more judges. The judge or panel of judges may also be\ncollectively referred to as \"the bench\" (in contrast to attorneys and\nbarristers, collectively referred to as \"the bar\"). In the United States, and\nother common law jurisdictions, the term \"court\" (in the case of U.S. federal\ncourts) by law is used to describe the judge himself or herself. See\ngenerally : \"The Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of a Chief\nJustice of the United States and eight associate justices [ . . . ]\" (italics\nadded); : \"Each court of appeals shall consist of the circuit judges of the\ncircuit in regular active service.\" (italics added); (in part): \"Each district\ncourt shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular\nactive service.\" (italics added); (in part): \"In each judicial district, the\nbankruptcy judges in regular active service shall constitute a unit of the\ndistrict court to be known as the bankruptcy court for that district [ . . . ]\"\n(italics added).\n\nIn the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on\npersonal jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction, and venue over the parties\nto the litigation.\n","linknr":415,"url":"Court","recorded":1362890646,"links":92,"instances":["law","law","law","law","legal_system","law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Courts|*"],"headings":["Etymology","Jurisdiction","Trial and appellate courts","Civil law courts and common law courts","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Old_Bailey_Microcosm_edited.jpg/250px-Old_Bailey_Microcosm_edited.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/70px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["party","law"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["venue","law"],["reporter","law"],["bench","law"],["bar","law"],["sanctions","law"]],"members":["sanctions","bar","bench","venue","civil_law","reporter","party"],"related":["London","Tribunal","Government","Institution","Authority","Adjudication","Legal_dispute","Party_(law)","Justice","Private_law","Criminal_law","Administrative_law","Rule_of_law","Common_law","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Legal_system","Dispute_resolution","Rights_of_the_accused","Criminal_defense","Law","Judiciary","Venue_(law)","Courtroom","Courthouse","Jurisdiction","Latin","William_Blackstone","Plaintiff","Injury","Defendant","Officer_of_the_court","Legal_remedy","Bailiff","Reporter_(law)","Chairman","Judge","Bench_(law)","Lawyer","Barrister","Bar_(law)","United_States","Personal_jurisdiction","Subject-matter_jurisdiction","Criminal_jurisdiction","Constitution","Statute","English_law","Trial_court","Trial","Original_jurisdiction","Trier_of_fact","Jury_trial","Question_of_law","Bench_trial","Anglosphere","Appellate_court","Appeal","Crown_Court","England_and_Wales","Inquisitorial_system","Adversarial_system","Procedural_law","Civil_procedure","Criminal_procedure","Tribunal","Sanctions_(law)","International_judicial_institution","International_Criminal_Court","Appellate_court","Administrative_court","Constitutional_court","Court_of_Faculties","Court-martial","Courts_of_England_and_Wales","Ecclesiastical_court","Equity_court","Family_court","High_Court_of_Justiciary","Revolutionary_Tribunal","French_Revolution","Scots_law","Scottish_Court_Service","Supreme_court","Trial_court","Court_show"]}
