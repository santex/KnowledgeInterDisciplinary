Titer testing employs serial dilution to obtain\napproximate quantitative information from an analytical procedure that\ninherently only evaluates as positive or negative. The titer corresponds to the\nhighest dilution factor that still yields a positive reading. For example, positive readings in the first 8 serial\ntwofold dilutions translate into a titer of (i.e., 2 â8 ). Titers are\nsometimes expressed by the denominator only, for example 1:256 is written\n256.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Titer","recorded":1362481386,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical pathology","Titration","Immunology"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Concentration","Serial_dilution","Virus","Fat","Tallow","Yellow_grease","Serology","Titration","Antibody_titer","W/v","Mg%"]}
