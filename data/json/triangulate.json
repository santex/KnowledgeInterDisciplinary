The point can then be fixed as the third point of a triangle\nwith one known side and two known angles.\n\nTriangulation can also refer to the accurate surveying of systems of very large\ntriangles, called 'triangulation networks'. This followed from the work of\nWillebrord Snell in 1615–17, who showed how a point could be located from the\nangles subtended from three known points, but measured at the new unknown point\nrather than the previously fixed points, a problem called resectioning.\nSurveying error is minimized if a mesh of triangles at the largest appropriate\nscale is established first. Points inside the triangles can all then be\naccurately located with reference to it. Such triangulation methods were used\nfor accurate large-scale land surveying until the rise of global navigation\nsatellite systems in the 1980s.\n","title":"Triangulation","headings":["Applications","Distance to a point by measuring two fixed angles","History","See also","References","Further reading"]},"micro-relation":["3: Surveying","2: Angle","2: Trilateration","2: Willebrord_Snell","2: Global_navigation_satellite_system","2: Coordinate","2: Liu_Hui","2: Trig_point","1: Trigonometry","1: Geometry","1: Distance","1: Law_of_sines","1: Triangle","1: Formula","1: Euclidean_geometry","1: Curvature_of_the_Earth","1: Spherical_trigonometry","1: Trigonometric_identities","1: Navigation","1: Metrology","1: Astrometry","1: Binocular_vision","1: Model_rocketry","1: Weapon","1: Thales","1: Similar_triangles","1: Pyramids","1: Proclus","1: Rhind_papyrus","1: Slope","1: Alidade","1: Hero_of_Alexandria","1: Pei_Xiu","1: Joseph_Needham","1: Geography_in_medieval_Islam","1: Astrolabe","1: Donald_Routledge_Hill","1: Abu_Rayhan_Biruni","1: Abu_Rayhan_Biruni#Geodesy_and_geography","1: Latin_translations_of_the_12th_century","1: Jacob's_staff","1: Portolan_charts","1: Gemma_Frisius","1: Peter_Apian","1: Tycho_Brahe","1: Ven,_Sweden","1: Øresund","1: William_Cuningham","1: Thomas_Digges","1: John_Norden","1: Christopher_Saxton","1: Alkmaar","1: Bergen_op_Zoom","1: Jean_Picard","1: Paris_Meridian","1: Paris","1: Sourdon","1: Amiens","1: Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini","1: Jacques_Cassini","1: Dunkirk","1: Perpignan","1: César-François_Cassini_de_Thury","1: Meridian_arc","1: Principal_Triangulation_of_Great_Britain","1: Ordnance_Survey","1: Great_Trigonometric_Survey","1: Mount_Everest","1: Jean_Joseph_Tranchot","1: Rhineland","1: Karl_von_Müffling","1: Carl_Friedrich_Gauss","1: Kingdom_of_Hanover","1: Least_squares","1: Simultaneous_equation","1: Retriangulation_of_Great_Britain","1: Struve_Geodetic_Arc","1: World_Heritage_Site","1: GSM_localization","1: Multilateration","1: Parallax","1: SOCET_SET","1: Stereopsis","1: Tessellation","1: Triangulation_in_three_dimensions"]}
