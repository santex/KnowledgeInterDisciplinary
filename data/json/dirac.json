He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University\nof Cambridge, a member of the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of\nMiami, and spent the last decade of his life at Florida State University.\n\nAmong other discoveries, he formulated the Dirac equation, which describes the\nbehaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared\nthe Nobel Prize in Physics for 1933 with Erwin Schrödinger, \"for the discovery\nof new productive forms of atomic theory.\"<ref name=nobel>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/ | title=The\nNobel Prize in Physics 1933 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=4 April\n2013}}</ref> He also did work that forms the basis of modern attempts to\nreconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics.\n\nHe was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. Albert\nEinstein said of him \"This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and\nmadness is awful\"<ref></ref> referring to his autistic traits. His mathematical\nbrilliance, however, means he is regarded as one of the most significant\nphysicists of the 20th century.\n","title":"Paul%20Dirac","headings":["Personal life","Career","Students","Legacy","Publications","See also","References","Bibliography","Further reading","External links"]},"micro-relation":["5: Werner_Heisenberg","4: Bristol","4: Florida_State_University","4: Quantum_electrodynamics","3: University_of_Cambridge","3: University_of_Bristol","3: Ralph_Fowler","3: John_Polkinghorne","3: Dirac_equation","3: Fermion","3: Erwin_SchrÃ¶dinger","3: General_relativity","2: Tallahassee,_Florida","2: United_Kingdom","2: University_of_Miami","2: Richard_Feynman","2: Stephen_Hawking","2: Roger_Penrose","2: Dirac_delta_function","2: Bra-ket_notation","2: Dirac_large_numbers_hypothesis","2: Gamma_matrices","2: Diracâvon_Neumann_axioms","2: Canonical_quantization","2: Quantum_mechanics","2: Lucasian_Professor_of_Mathematics","2: St_John's_College,_Cambridge","2: Niels_Bohr","2: Institute_of_Physics","2: Tallahassee","2: Magnetic_monopole","2: Matrix_mechanics","2: Electron","2: Hilbert_space","2: Renormalization","2: University_of_New_South_Wales","2: Dirac_Prize","2: International_Centre_for_Theoretical_Physics","2: Boson","1: Switzerland","1: Physics","1: Theoretical_physics","1: Homi_J._Bhabha","1: Harish-Chandra","1: Denis_Sciama","1: Fred_Hoyle","1: Behram_KurÅunoÄlu","1: Christie_Eliezer","1: A._Lees","1: Michael_Atiyah","1: Hans_Bethe","1: Abdus_Salam","1: Dirac_comb","1: FermiâDirac_statistics","1: Incomplete_FermiâDirac_integral","1: Complete_FermiâDirac_integral","1: Dirac_sea","1: Dirac_bracket","1: Dirac_spinor","1: Interaction_picture","1: Dirac_measure","1: Dirac_monopole","1: Dirac_adjoint","1: Dirac_fermion","1: Fermionic_field","1: Dirac_spectrum","1: Dirac_string","1: Dirac_algebra","1: Dirac_operator","1: Planck_constant","1: Dirac's_theorem_on_Hamiltonian_cycles","1: Dirac's_theorem_on_chordal_graphs","1: Dirac's_theorem_on_cycles_in_k-connected_graphs","1: KapitsaâDirac_effect","1: Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac_force","1: Breit_equation","1: EinsteinâMaxwellâDirac_equations","1: Canonical_quantum_gravity","1: Exchange_interaction","1: First_class_constraint","1: Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics","1: Negative_probability","1: Path_integral_formulation","1: Primary_constraint","1: Photon_dynamics_in_the_double-slit_experiment","1: Spin_magnetic_moment","1: Virtual_particle","1: Atheism","1: Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society","1: Theoretical_physicist","1: Center_for_Theoretical_Studies,_University_of_Miami","1: Antimatter","1: Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","1: Atomic_theory","1: Albert_Einstein","1: Autism_spectrum","1: Bishopston,_Bristol","1: Saint-Maurice,_Switzerland","1: French_language","1: Bristol_Central_Library","1: Naturalised","1: Bishop_Road_Primary_School","1: Society_of_Merchant_Venturers","1: Cotham_School","1: Electrical_engineering","1: First_class_honours","1: Bachelor_of_Science","1: PostâWorld_War_I_recession","1: Bachelor_of_Arts","1: Department_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research","1: Quantum_physics","1: Eugene_Wigner","1: Gabriel_Andrew_Dirac","1: Princeton,_New_Jersey","1: J._Robert_Oppenheimer","1: George_Gamow","1: Time_evolution","1: Fermi-Dirac_statistics","1: Bose-Einstein_statistics","1: Solvay_Conference","1: Max_Planck","1: Wolfgang_Pauli","1: Nobel_Prize","1: Royal_Medal","1: Copley_Medal","1: Max_Planck_medal","1: Royal_Society","1: American_Physical_Society","1: Order_of_Merit","1: Knight","1: Blue_plaque","1: Saint-Maurice,_Valais","1: Slate","1: Westminster_Abbey","1: Dean_of_Westminster","1: James_Clark_Maxwell","1: Electromagnetism","1: Quantum_field","1: Gauge_theory","1: Superstring_theory","1: Arnold_Sommerfeld","1: Poisson_bracket","1: Classical_mechanics","1: Wolfgang_Ernst_Pauli","1: Abraham_Pais","1: Special_relativity","1: Equation_of_motion","1: Wavefunction","1: Positron","1: Antiparticle","1: Carl_David_Anderson","1: Enrico_Fermi","1: Beta_decay","1: Field_equation","1: Point_particle","1: Anticommutativity","1: Quark","1: Lepton","1: Dirac_field","1: Maxwell_equations","1: YangâMills_theory","1: Vacuum_polarization","1: Julian_Schwinger","1: Sin-Itiro_Tomonaga","1: Freeman_Dyson","1: History_of_science","1: SchrÃ¶dinger_equation","1: Physical_system","1: Electrical_charge","1: Physical_cosmology","1: World_War_II","1: Uranium_enrichment","1: Gas_centrifuge","1: Hamiltonian_formalism","1: Anomalous_magnetic_moment","1: Lamb_shift","1: Victor_Frederick_Weisskopf","1: Schwinger","1: Feynman","1: Coral_Gables,_Florida","1: John_Stewart_Bell","1: National_High_Magnetic_Field_Laboratory","1: Didcot","1: Curved_space-time","1: Quantum_field_theory","1: Hamiltonian_mechanics","1: Spinor","1: World_Association_of_Theoretical_and_Computational_Chemists","1: Churchill_College,_Cambridge","1: Physicist","1: England","1: Florida","1: United_States"]}
