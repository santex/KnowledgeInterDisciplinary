{"cursor":"41853","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n Monasticism]] Universal Relief Team'' (AMURT) at work during a disaster in\n Gujarat (India) in 2001]]\n\nA 'monk' (from , monachos, \"single, solitary\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu-\n/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmonaxo%2Fs Î¼Î¿Î½Î±ÏÏÏ],\nHenry George Liddell, Robert Scott A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus\nproject ) is a person who practices religious asceticism, living either\nalone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decided to\ndedicate his life to serve the other living beings or to be an ascetic who\nvoluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his life in prayer and\ncontemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in\nphilosophy.\n\nIn the Greek language the term can apply to women, but in modern English it is\nmainly in use for men. Meanwhile nun is typically used for female monastics.\n\nAlthough the term monachos (\"monk\") is of Christian origin, in the English\nlanguage it tends to be used analogously or loosely also for both male and\nfemale ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds.\n\nThe term monk is generic and in some religious or philosophical traditions it\ntherefore may be considered interchangeable with other terms such as ascetic.\nHowever, being generic, it is not interchangeable with terms that denote\nparticular kinds of monk, such as friar, cenobite, hermit, anchorite,\nhesychast, solitary.\n","linknr":599,"url":"Monk","recorded":1362486445,"links":85,"instances":["magazine","priest","theology","united_states","catholic_church","architecture","vesture","christianity","liturgy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Asceticism","Religious
