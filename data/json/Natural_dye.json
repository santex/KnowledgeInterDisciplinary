{"cursor":"40392","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Natural dyes' are dyes or colorants derived from plants, invertebrates, or\nminerals. The majority of natural dyes are 'vegetable dyes' from plant sources\nâroots, berries, bark, leaves, and wood â and other organic sources such as\nfungi and lichens.\n\nArchaeologists have found evidence of textile dyeing dating back to the\nNeolithic period. In China, dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been\ntraced back more than 5,000 years. Goodwin (1982), p.\n11. The essential process of dyeing changed little over time. Typically,\nthe dye material is put in a pot of water and then the textiles to be dyed are\nadded to the pot, which is heated and stirred until the color is transferred.\nTextile fiber may be dyed before spinning (\"dyed in the wool\"), but most\ntextiles are \"yarn-dyed\" or \"piece-dyed\" after weaving. Many natural dyes\nrequire the use of chemicals called mordants to bind the dye to the textile\nfibers; tannin from oak galls, salt, natural alum, vinegar, and ammonia from\nstale urine were used by early dyers. Many mordants, and some dyes themselves,\nproduce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own\ndistricts.\n\nThroughout history, people have dyed their textiles using common, locally\navailable materials, but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent\ncolors such as the natural invertebrate dyes, Tyrian purple and crimson kermes,\nbecame highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world. Plant-based\ndyes such as woad ([[Isatis tinctoria]]), indigo, saffron, and madder were\nraised commercially and were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and\nEurope. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using resist\ndyeing techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth. such\nas cochineal and logwood ([[Haematoxylum campechianum]]) were brought to Europe\nby the Spanish treasure fleets, and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by\ncolonists to America.\n\nThe discovery of man-made synthetic dyes in the mid-19th century triggered a\nlong decline in the large-scale market for natural dyes. Synthetic dyes, which\ncould be produced in large quantities, quickly superseded natural dyes for the\ncommercial textile production enabled by the industrial revolution, and unlike\nnatural dyes, were suitable for the synthetic fibers that followed. Artists of\nthe [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] preferred the pure shades and subtle\nvariability of natural dyes, which mellow with age but preserve their true\ncolors, unlike early synthetic dyes, and helped ensure\nthat the old European techniques for dyeing and printing with natural dyestuffs\nwere preserved for use by home and craft dyers. Natural dyeing techniques are\nalso preserved by artisans in traditional cultures around the world.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the market for natural dyes in the fashion industry\nis experiencing a resurgence. Western consumers have become more\nconcerned about the health and environmental impact of synthetic dyes in\nmanufacturing and there is a growing demand for products that use natural dyes.\nThe European Union, for example, has encouraged Indonesian batik cloth producers\nto switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe.\n","linknr":815,"url":"Natural_dye","recorded":1362373086,"links":31,"instances":["weaving","textiles","chemical_science","geology","british_army","plant","dye"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Natural
