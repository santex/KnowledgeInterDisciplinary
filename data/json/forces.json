They can be\ndue to phenomena such as gravity, magnetism, or anything that might cause a mass\nto accelerate. |unit=newton |symbols='F' |derivations= 'F' = [[Mass|m]]\n'''''a'''''}}\n\nIn physics, a 'force' is any influence that causes an object to undergo a\ncertain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrical\nconstruction. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change\nits velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to\naccelerate, or a flexible object to deform, or both. Force can also be described\nby intuitive concepts such as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and\ndirection, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons\nand represented by the symbol 'F'.\n\nThe original form of Newton's second law states that the net force acting upon\nan object is equal to the rate at which its momentum changes with time.<ref>See\nfor example pages 9-1 and 9-2 of Feynman, Leighton and Sands (1963).</ref> If\nthe mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the acceleration of an\nobject is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the\ndirection of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the\nobject. As a formula, this is expressed as:\n\n:<math>\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}</math>\n\nwhere the arrows imply a vector quantity possessing both magnitude and\ndirection.\n\nRelated concepts to force include: thrust, which increases the velocity of an\nobject; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque which\nproduces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each\npart usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such\nforces through the body is the so-called mechanical stress.<ref></ref> Pressure\nis a simple type of stress. Stress usually causes deformation of solid\nmaterials, or flow in fluids.<ref name=\"texts\">e.g. ; .</ref><ref\nname=uniphysics_ch2>University Physics, Sears, Young & Zemansky,
