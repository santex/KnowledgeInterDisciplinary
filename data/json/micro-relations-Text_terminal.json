{"cursor":"19086","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'computer terminal' is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that\nis used for entering data into, and displaying data from, a computer or a\ncomputing system. Early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow\ncompared to punched cards or paper tape for input, but as the technology\nimproved and video displays were introduced, terminals pushed these older forms\nof interaction from the industry. A related development was timesharing systems,\nwhich evolved in parallel and made up for any inefficiencies of the user's\ntyping ability with the ability to support multiple users on the same machine,\neach at their own terminal.\n\nThe function of a terminal is confined to display and input of data; a device\nwith significant local programmable data processing capability may be called a\n\"smart terminal\" or fat client. A terminal that depends on the host computer for\nits processing power is called a dumb terminal or thin client. A personal\ncomputer can run terminal emulator software that replicates the function of a\nterminal, sometimes allowing concurrent use of local programs and access to a\ndistant terminal host system.\n","linknr":361,"url":"Text_terminal","recorded":1362561113,"links":41,"instances":["pc","computers","programming_library","computer_terminal","computer_science","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer
