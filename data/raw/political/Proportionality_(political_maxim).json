For other uses of\nthe term'proportionality', see [[Proportionality (disambiguation)]].\n\nThe 'principle of proportionality' is a political maxim which states that no\nlayer of government should take any action that exceeds that which is necessary\nto achieve the objective of government (Regardless of intent of objective). It\nwas initially developed in the German legal system.\n\nIt is a fundamental principle of European Union law. According to this\nprinciple, the EU may only act to exactly the extent that is needed to\nachieve its objectives, and no further. This principle has underpinned the\nEuropean Communities since their inception in 1957. In the presently\napplicable primary law, the principle of proportionality is clearly\nformulated in the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the\nEuropean Community as follows:\n\n{{Quotation|\n\nAny action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the\nobjectives of this Treaty.\n\n}}\n\nThis principle is also explicitly specified in the new Treaty of Lisbon.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Proportionality_(political_maxim)","recorded":1362556012,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["European Union law","Legal doctrines and principles"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Society.svg/45px-Society.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["European_Union_law","European_Communities","Treaty_establishing_the_European_Community","Treaty_of_Lisbon"]}
