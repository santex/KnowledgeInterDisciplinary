In translation,\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) produced by transcription is decoded by the ribosome to\nproduce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide, that will later fold into\nan active protein. In bacteria, translation occurs in the cell's cytoplasm,\nwhere the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located, and bind to the\nmRNA. In eukaryotes, translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic\nreticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis. The ribosome facilitates\ndecoding by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences\nto that of the mRNA. The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained\ntogether into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is \"read\" by the\nribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker tape.\n\nIn many instances, the entire ribosome/mRNA complex bind to the outer membrane\nof the rough endoplasmic reticulum and release the nascent protein polypeptide\ninside for later vesicle transport and secretion outside of the cell. Many types\nof transcribed RNA, such as transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and small nuclear RNA,\ndo not undergo translation into proteins.\n\nTranslation proceeds in four phases: 'initiation', 'elongation', 'translocation'\nand 'termination' (all describing the growth of the amino acid chain, or\npolypeptide that is the product of translation). Amino acids are brought to\nribosomes and assembled into proteins.\n\nIn activation, the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct\ntransfer RNA (tRNA). The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3' OH\nof the tRNA by an ester bond. When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it, it\nis termed \"charged\". Initiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome\nbinding to the 5' end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors (IF).\nTermination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a\nstop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). No tRNA can recognize or bind to this codon.\nInstead, the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor protein that\nprompts the disassembly of the entire ribosome/mRNA complex.\n\nA number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation; these include anisomycin,\ncycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and\npuromycin, among others. Prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from\nthat of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target\nbacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic host's cells.\n","linknr":459,"url":"Translation_(genetics)","recorded":1362486414,"links":56,"instances":["genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Protein biosynthesis","Gene expression"],"headings":["Basic mechanisms","Genetic code","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Protein_synthesis.svg/400px-Protein_synthesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg/300px-Ribosome_mRNA_translation_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Translation.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/TRNA-Phe_yeast_1ehz.png/220px-TRNA-Phe_yeast_1ehz.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription","cell"],"related":["Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Cell_(biology)","Messenger_RNA","Ribosome","Molecular_biology","Genetics","Protein_biosynthesis","Gene_expression","MRNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Ribosome","Amino_acid","Polypeptide","Protein_folding","Cytoplasm","Ribosome","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Vectorial_synthesis","Ribosome","TRNA","Base_pair","Anticodon","Ticker_tape","Rough_endoplasmic_reticulum","Polypeptide","Covalent_bond","TRNA","Ester_bond","Initiation_factors","Release_factor","Antibiotic","Anisomycin","Cycloheximide","Chloramphenicol","Tetracycline","Streptomycin","Erythromycin","Puromycin","Amino_acid","Ribosome","MRNA","The_Benjamin/Cummings_Publishing_Company","C-terminus","W._H._Freeman_and_Company","Genetic_code","Nucleotide","Amino_acid","Ribosome","Ribosomal_RNA","Amino_acid","Aminoacyl_tRNA_synthetase","Enzyme","TRNA","Amino_acids","Base_pair","Transfer_RNA","Translocase","EF-G","Prokaryotes","EEF2","Eukaryotes","3'_end","Reading_frames","Genetic_code","Structural_formula","Primary_structure","Protein_folding","Hydrophilic","Hydrophobic","Secondary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Tertiary_structure","Protein_structure_prediction","Primary_structure","Codon_Dictionary","Amino_acid","Selenocysteine","Bioinformatics","Methionine","Leucine","Yeast","GenBank","Mitochondrial","Yeast","Mold","Protozoan","Coelenterate","Mycoplasma","Spiroplasma","Invertebrate","Ciliate","Dasycladacean","Hexamita","Echinoderm","Flatworm","Euplotid","Plastid","Ascidian","Blepharisma","Chlorophycean","Trematode","Scenedesmus_obliquus","Thraustochytrium","DNA_codon_table","Expanded_genetic_code","Protein_methods"]}
