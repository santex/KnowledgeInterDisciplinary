Although some large birds\nsuch as swans learn migration routes from their parents, in most small species,\nsuch as passerines, the route is genetically programmed, and young birds can\ninnately navigate to their wintering area.\n\n\n\nSometimes this programming goes wrong, and the young bird, in its first autumn,\nmigrates on a route 180Â° from the correct route. This is shown in the diagram,\nwhere the breeding range of a hypothetical Asian species is shown in yellow.\nThe correct migration route to the wintering grounds in south east Asia is\nindicated in red.\n\nIf a bird sets off in the opposite direction, shown by the orange arrow, it will\nend up in Western Europe instead of South East Asia. This is a mechanism that\nleads to birds such as Pallas's Warbler turning up thousands of kilometres from\nwhere they should be.

Although \"reverse migration\" per se certainly does occur, and has\nbeen documented well in numerous instances, it does not account for the\noccurrence in Europe in autumn of Asian vagrants that winter in East Africa,\nfor instance, or the rarity of many southern European species in the UK that\nwinter in West Africa.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Reverse_migration_(birds)","recorded":1362668802,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bird migration"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Asiamig2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg/140px-Auklet_flock_Shumagins_1986.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Bird_migration","Swan","Passerine","Gene","Asia","Europe","Pallas's_Warbler","Keith_Vinicombe","Lake_Baikal","Siberia","Drift_migration"]}
