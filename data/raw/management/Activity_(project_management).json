A task can be broken down into\nassignments which should also have a defined start and end date or a deadline\nfor completion. One or more assignments on a task puts the task under execution.\nCompletion of all assignments on a specific task normally renders the task\ncompleted. Tasks can be linked together to create dependencies.\n\nIn most projects, tasks may suffer one of two major drawbacks:\n\n* Task dependency: Which is normal as most tasks rely on others to get done.\n  However, this can lead to the stagnation of a project when many tasks cannot\n  get started unless others are finished.\n* Unclear understanding of the term complete: For example, if a task is 90%\n  complete, does this mean that it will take only 1/9 of the time already spent\n  on this task to finish it? Although this is mathematically sound, it is rarely\n  the case when it comes to practice.
