It was named after the mythological character\nof Io, a priestess of Hera who became one of the lovers of Zeus.\n\nWith over 400 active volcanoes, Io is the most geologically active object in the\nSolar System. This extreme\ngeologic activity is the result of tidal heating from friction generated within\nIo's interior as it is pulled between Jupiter and the other Galilean\nsatellitesâEuropa, Ganymede and Callisto. Several volcanoes produce plumes of\nsulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as above the surface. Io's surface\nis also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive\ncompression at the base of the moon's silicate crust. Some of these peaks are\ntaller than Earth's Mount Everest. Unlike most\nsatellites in the outer Solar System, which are mostly composed of water ice, Io\nis primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide\ncore. Most of Io's surface is characterized by extensive plains coated with\nsulfur and sulfur dioxide frost.\n\nIo's volcanism is responsible for many of the satellite's unique features. Its\nvolcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the\nsurface in various shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green, largely due\nto allotropes and compounds of sulfur. Numerous extensive lava flows, several\nmore than in length, also mark the surface. The materials produced by this\nvolcanism provide material for Io's thin, patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's\nextensive magnetosphere. Io's volcanic ejecta also produce a large plasma torus\naround Jupiter.\n\nIo played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and\n18th centuries. It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei, along with the\nother Galilean satellites. This discovery furthered the adoption of the\nCopernican model of the Solar System, the development of Kepler's laws of\nmotion, and the first measurement of the speed of light. From Earth, Io remained\nnothing more than a point of light until the late 19th and early 20th centuries,\nwhen it became possible to resolve its large-scale surface features, such as the\ndark red polar and bright equatorial regions. In 1979, the two [[Voyager\nprogram|Voyager]] spacecraft revealed Io to be a geologically active world, with\nnumerous volcanic features, large mountains, and a young surface with no obvious\nimpact craters. The [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] spacecraft performed\nseveral close flybys in the 1990s and early 2000s, obtaining data about Io's\ninterior structure and surface composition. These spacecraft also revealed the\nrelationship between the satellite and Jupiter's magnetosphere and the existence\nof a belt of radiation centered on Io's orbit. Io receives about 3,600 rem (36\nSv) of radiation per\nday. http://zimmer.csufresno.edu/~fringwal/w08a.jup.txt\n\nFurther observations have been made by CassiniâHuygens in 2000 and New Horizons\nin 2007, as well as from Earth-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope\nas their technology has advanced.\n","linknr":1621,"url":"Io_(moon)","recorded":1362268779,"links":133,"instances":["moon","astronomy","mythology","unit","geology","geology","unit","spacecraft","geology","volcano","volcano","mythology","moon","volcano","moon","volcano","fruit","spacecraft","physics","volcano","geology","astronomy","moon"],"pdf":["http://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/%7Eperry/IVO-Berkeley.pdf","http://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/%7Eperry/IVO-Berkeley.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2003/pdf/1720.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2003/pdf/1720.pdf","http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/images/io_comp_color.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EAE03/07912/EAE03-J-07912.pdf"],"categories":["Io
