This full moon was near its greatest northern ecliptic latitude, so\n the southern craters are especially prominent.]] .]] A 'full moon' is a lunar\n phase that occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the\n Sun. More precisely, a full moon occurs when the geocentric apparent (ecliptic)\n longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180 degrees; the Moon is then in\n opposition with the Sun.\n\nLunar eclipses can only occur at full moon, where the moon's orbit allows it to\npass through the Earth's shadow. Lunar eclipses do not occur every month because\nthe moon usually passes above or below the Earth's shadow (which is mostly\nrestricted to the ecliptic plane). Lunar eclipses can occur only when the full\nmoon occurs near the two nodes of the orbit, either the ascending or descending\nnode. This causes eclipses to only occur about every 6 months, and often 2 weeks\nbefore or after a solar eclipse at new moon at the opposite node.\n\nAs seen from Earth, the hemisphere of the Moon that is facing the Earth (the\nnear side) is almost fully illuminated by the Sun and appears round. Only during\na full moon is the opposite hemisphere of the Moon, which is not visible from\nEarth (the far side), completely unilluminated.\n\nThe time interval between similar lunar phasesâthe synodic monthâaverages about\n29.53 days. Therefore, in those lunar calendars in which each month begins on\nthe new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th of the lunar month.\nBecause lunar months have a whole number of days, lunar months may be either 29\nor 30 days long.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Full_moon","recorded":1363582043,"links":[],"instances":["astronomy","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Full moon"],"headings":["Characteristics","Folklore","Calendars","Religious significance","Full moon names","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["opposition","astronomy"],["graph","mathematics"]],"members":["opposition","graph"],"related":["Lunar_phase","Moon","Earth","Sun","Ecliptic","Opposition_(astronomy)","Lunar_eclipse","Plane_of_the_ecliptic","Orbital_node","Solar_eclipse","New_moon","Near_side_of_the_Moon","Far_side_of_the_Moon","Synodic_month","Lunar_calendar","Lunar_month","Naked_eye","Graph_(mathematics)","Tangent","Slope","Almanac","Coordinated_Universal_Time","Calendars","Time_zone","Astronomy","Terrestrial_Time","Ephemerides","Universal_Time","New_moon","Synodic_month","Full_moon_cycle","Insomnia","Insanity","Lycanthropy","Bradford_Royal_Infirmary","Hindu_calendar","Thai_lunar_calendar","Hebrew_calendar","Islamic_calendar","Tibetan_calendar","Maya_calendar","Coligny_calendar","Chinese_calendar","Month","Sukkot","Passover","K._Sri_Dhammananda","Blue_moon","Easter","Gregorian_calendar","Algonquian_peoples","Sanskrit","Uposatha","Pali","Uposatha","Sinhala_language","Wolf_moon","Yule","Snow_Moon","Storm_Moon","Storm_Moon","Hanuman","Hare_moon","Vesak","Guru_Purnima","Raksha_bandhan","Harvest_Moon","Bhaadra","Hunter's_moon","Kojagiri","Sharad_Purnima","Lakshmi","Beaver_moon","Kartik_Poornima","Yule","Margashirsha","Season","Solstice","Equinox","Metonic_cycle","Lunar_phase","Lunar_eclipse","Month","Near_side_of_the_Moon","New_moon","Orbit_of_the_Moon"]}
