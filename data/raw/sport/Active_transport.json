{"cursor":"10758","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Active transport' is the movement of a substance across a cell membrane\nagainst its concentration gradient (from low to high concentration). In all\ncells, this is usually concerned with accumulating high concentrations of\nmolecules that the cell needs, such as ions, glucose and amino acids. If the\nprocess uses chemical energy, such as from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it is\ntermed primary active transport. Secondary active transport involves the use of\nan electrochemical gradient. Active transport uses cellular energy, unlike\npassive transport, which does not use cellular energy. Active transport is a\ngood example of a process for which cells require energy. Examples of active\ntransport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the\nuptake of mineral ions into root hair cells of plants. http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_p-\nre_2011/homeostasis/importancerev6.shtml\n","linknr":294,"url":"Active_transport","recorded":1362505023,"links":38,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Membrane biology|Membrane biology","Biological matter|membrane"],"headings":["Details","Primary active transport","ATP using primary active transport types","Secondary active transport","Antiport","Symport","Examples","Endocytosis","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Scheme_sodium-potassium_pump-en.svg/400px-Scheme_sodium-potassium_pump-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Scheme_secundary_active_transport-en.svg/400px-Scheme_secundary_active_transport-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Adenosine_triphosphate","Primary_active_transport","Secondary_active_transport","Electrochemical_gradient","Passive_transport","Root_hair","Membrane_proteins","Phospholipid_bilayer","Concentration_gradient","Cotransport","Antiport","Symport","Secondary_active_transport","Sodium-glucose_transport_proteins","Transmembrane_ATPase","NaKATPase","Cell_potential","Redox","Photon","Light","Electron_transport_chain","NADH","Photosynthesis","Thylakoid_membrane","NADPH","P-type_ATPase","Sodium_potassium_pump","Calcium_pump","Proton_pump","F-ATPase","V-ATPase","ATP_binding_cassette","Co-transport","Primary_active_transport","Adenosine_triphosphate","Electrochemical_potential","Antiport","Symport","Entropy","Sodium-calcium_exchanger","Calcium_ATPase","Second_messenger","Solution","Electrochemical_gradient","Sodium-glucose_transport_proteins","Co-transport","Glucose","Galactose","Symporter","Proximal_tubule","Nephron","Kidney","Oral_rehydration_therapy","Glucosuria","Sodium","Potassium","Magnesium","Calcium","Ion_transporter","Ion_channel","Sodium-potassium_pump","Epithelial_cell","Gastric_acid","Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase","Electrogenic_pump","Water","Ethanol","Chloroform","Vacuole","Cytoplasm","Pinocytosis","Phagocytosis","ATP-binding_cassette_transporter","Ion_channel","Protein_targeting","Translocon","Countercurrent_exchange"]}
