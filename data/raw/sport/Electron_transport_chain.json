{"cursor":"29207","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" in eukaryotes. The NADH and succinate generated in the citric acid cycle are\n oxidized, providing energy to power ATP synthase.]]\n\nAn 'electron transport chain (ETC)' couples electron transfer between an\nelectron donor (such as NADH) and an electron acceptor (such as O 2)\nwith the transfer of H + ions (protons) across a membrane. The\nresulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to generate chemical energy in\nthe form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Electron transport chains are the\ncellular mechanisms used for extracting energy from sunlight in photosynthesis\nand also from redox reactions, such as the oxidation of sugars (respiration).\n\nIn chloroplasts, light drives the conversion of water to oxygen and\nNADP + to NADPH with transfer of H + ions across chloroplast\nmembranes. In mitochondria, it is the conversion of oxygen to water, NADH to\nNAD + and succinate to fumarate that are required to generate the\nproton gradient. Electron transport chains are major sites of premature electron\nleakage to oxygen, generating superoxide and potentially resulting in increased\noxidative stress.\n","linknr":592,"url":"Electron_transport_chain","recorded":1362575935,"links":43,"instances":["environmental","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular respiration","Integral membrane proteins"],"headings":["Background","Electron transport chains in mitochondria","Electron transport chains in bacteria","Photosynthetic electron transport chains","Summary","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Mitochondrial_electron_transport_chain%E2%80%94Etc4.svg/400px-Mitochondrial_electron_transport_chain%E2%80%94Etc4.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Thylakoid_membrane.png/400px-Thylakoid_membrane.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fermentation","biochemistry"],["hypoxia","environmental"]],"members":["hypoxia","fermentation"],"related":["Eukaryote","Citric_acid_cycle","ATP_synthase","Electron","Electron_transfer","Electron_donor","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Electron_acceptor","Oxygen","Proton","Cell_membrane","Electrochemical_gradient","Adenosine_triphosphate","Photosynthesis","Redox","Cellular_respiration","Chloroplast","Energy_transformation","Water","Oxygen","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate","Mitochondria","Succinate","Fumarate","Superoxide","Oxidative_stress","Redox_reaction","Gibbs_free_energy","Electrochemical_gradient","Flagella","ATP_synthase","Conserved_sequence","Adenosine_triphosphate","Substrate-level_phosphorylation","Glycolysis","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Eukaryotic","Mitochondria","Citric_acid_cycle","Fatty_acid_metabolism","Amino_acid_metabolism","NADH","Succinate","Enzymatic","Proton_gradient","Proton_pump","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Reactive_oxygen_species","Superoxide","Oxidative_stress","Senescence","Mitochondrion","Mitochondrial_matrix","Adenosine_diphosphate","Inorganic_phosphate","Krebs_cycle","Ubiquinone","Succinate_dehydrogenase","Cytochrome_bc1_complex","Cytochrome_c","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","NADH_dehydrogenase","NADH","Flavin_mononucleotide","Iron-sulfur_cluster","Succinate_dehydrogenase","FAD","SDHA","SDHB","Succinate_dehydrogenase_complex_subunit_C","SDHD","Cytochrome_bc1_complex","Q_cycle","Cytochrome_c","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","Cytochrome_c","Cyanide","Chemiosmosis","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Peter_D._Mitchell","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Electrochemical_gradient","ATP_synthase","ATP_synthase","Ion_channel","Gibb's_free_energy","Thermogenin","Brown_adipose_tissue","Thermogenesis","2,4-Dinitrophenol","Prokaryotes","Bacteria","Archaea","Dehydrogenase","Cytochrome","Hydrogenase","Quinone","Q_cycle","Cytochromes","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Anaerobic_organism","Photophosphorylation","Photosynthesis","Photosynthetic_reaction_center","Light-dependent_reaction","CoRR_Hypothesis","Hydrogen_hypothesis","Electron_equivalent"]}
