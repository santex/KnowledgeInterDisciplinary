The science of biostatistics encompasses the design of\nbiological experiments, especially in medicine, agriculture and fishery; the\ncollection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the\ninterpretation of, and inference from, the results. Major branch of this is\nmedical biostatistics , which is exclusively concerned with medicine\nand health.\n","linknr":513,"url":"Biostatistics","recorded":1362510327,"links":43,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf","http://www.tilsonfunds.com/MungerUCSBspeech.pdf","http://www.medpagetoday.com/lib/content/Medpage-Guide-to-Biostatistics.pdf"],"categories":["Biostatistics|","Bioinformatics","Public health","Demography"],"headings":["Biostatistics and the history of biological thought","Education and training programs","Applications of biostatistics","Biostatistics journals","Related fields","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Issoria_lathonia.jpg/32px-Issoria_lathonia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Statistics","Biology","Experiment","Medicine","Agriculture","Fishery","Gregor_Mendel","Genetics","Darwinism","Walter_Frank_Raphael_Weldon","Karl_Pearson","Charles_Benedict_Davenport","William_Bateson","Wilhelm_Johannsen","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Ronald_Fisher","Sewall_G._Wright","Population_genetics","J._B._S._Haldane","Mathematical_biology","Evolutionary_biology","Genetics","Statistics","D'Arcy_Thompson","Qualitative_data","Thomas_Hunt_Morgan","Friden,_Inc.","Caltech","Placer_mining","Postgraduate","United_States","Epidemiology","Bioinformatics","Computational_biology","Public_health","Clinical_trial","Quality_control","Economics","Public_health","Epidemiology","Health_services_research","Nutrition","Environmental_health","Clinical_trial","Medicine","Population_genetics","Statistical_genetics","Genotype","Phenotype","Animal_breeding","Gene","Alleles","Human_genetics","Genomics","Microarray","Proteomics","Ecology","Ecological_forecasting","Sequence_analysis","Systems_biology","Medical_informatics","Public_health_informatics","Bioinformatics","Computational_biology","Computational_biology","Computer_science","Operations_research","Psychometrics","Statistics","Econometrics","Demography","Ecological_forecasting","Group_size_measures","Machine_Learning","Network_Biology","Quantitative_parasitology","Systems_Biology"]}
