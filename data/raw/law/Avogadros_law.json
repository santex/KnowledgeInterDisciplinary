{"cursor":"3327","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Avogadro's law' (sometimes referred to as 'Avogadro's hypothesis' or\n'Avogadro's principle') is a gas law which states that, under the same condition\nof temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number\nof molecules. The law is named after Amedeo Avogadro who, in 1811,\n[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/avogadro.html English translation].\nhypothesized that two given samples of an ideal gas, of the same volume and at\nthe same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Thus,\nthe number of molecules or atoms in a specific volume of ideal gas is\nindependent of their size or the molar mass of the gas.\n\nAs an example, equal volumes of molecular hydrogen and nitrogen contain the same\nnumber of molecules when they are at the same temperature and pressure, and\nobserve ideal gas behavior. In practice, real gases show small deviations from\nthe ideal behavior and the law holds only approximately, but is still a useful\napproximation for scientists.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Avogadro's_law","recorded":1362477035,"links":58,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gas laws","Amount of substance"],"headings":["Mathematical definition","Ideal gas law","Molar volume","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/1/1/2112360ed5ed4158d3cb2e3b7dc74642.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/9/7/c97f680f959dd059abbf28b619021dd2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/a/e5abdc980f6ec955208ab9f5b148311c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/6/9/f6936d846a2166d3c30b7c6ebf6a7e20.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole"],"related":["Gas_law","Temperature","Pressure","Volume","Gas","Molecule","Amedeo_Avogadro","Ideal_gas","Volume","Temperature","Pressure","Molecule","Gas","Molar_mass","Hydrogen","Nitrogen","Ideal_gas","Amount_of_substance","Physical_constant","Gas_constant","Pressure","Temperature","Kelvin","Ideal_gas_law","Standard_Temperature_and_Pressure","KPa","Mole_(unit)","KPa","Boyle's_law","Charles's_law","Combined_gas_law","Gay-Lussac's_law","Ideal_gas","Edrei_Arabo"]}
