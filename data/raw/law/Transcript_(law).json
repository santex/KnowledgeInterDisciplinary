{"cursor":"1923","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'transcript' is a written record of spoken language. In court proceedings, a\ntranscript is usually a record of all decisions of the judge, and the spoken\narguments by the litigants' lawyers. A related term used in the US is docket,\nnot a full transcript. The transcript is expected to be an exact and unedited\nrecord of every spoken word, with each speaker indicated. Such a record was\noriginally made by court stenographers who used a form of shorthand abbreviation\nto write as quickly as people spoke. Today most court reporters use a\nspecialized machine with a phonetic key system, typing a key or key combination\nfor every sound a person utters. Many courts worldwide have now begun to use\ndigital recording systems. The recordings are archived and are sent to court\nreporters or transcribers only when a transcript is requested. Many\nUS transcripts are indexed by Deposition Source so that they may be searched by\nlegal professionals via the internet. Transcripts may be available publicly or\nto a restricted group of persons; a fee may be charged.\n\nTranscripts may also be produced digitally. Transcripts produced by a digital\nreporter are oftentimes more accurate than those produced by a court\nstenographer.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Transcript_(law)","recorded":1362582138,"links":29,"instances":["publishing","court","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Court reporting","Legal documents"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/22px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","linguistics"],["docket","court"],["index","publishing"]],"members":["index","docket","transcription"],"related":["Transcription_(linguistics)","Court","Judge","Logical_argument","Litigant","Lawyers","Docket_(court)","Court","Stenographer","Shorthand","Court_reporter","Stenotype","Phonetic","Digital_recording","Court_reporter","Transcriber","Index_(publishing)","Deposition_Source","Internet"]}
