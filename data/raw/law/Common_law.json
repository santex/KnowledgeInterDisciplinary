{"cursor":"110529","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Common law', also known as 'case law' or 'precedent', is law developed by\njudges through decisions of courts and similar tribunals, as opposed to statutes\nadopted through the legislative process or regulations issued by the executive\nbranch [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CommonLaw.aspx Duhaime's\nLaw Dictionary, \"Definition of Common Law\"] .\n\nA \"common law system\" is a legal system that gives great precedential weight to\ncommon law, Washington Probate, \"Estate Planning & Probate Glossary\",\nWashington (State) Probate, s.v. \"common law\", [htm], 8 Dec. 2008: , retrieved on 7 November 2009. on the principle that it is\nunfair to treat similar facts differently on different occasions. Charles\nArnold-Baker, The Companion to British History, s.v. \"English Law\" (London:\nLoncross Denholm Press, 2008), 484. The body of precedent is called\n\"common law\" and it binds future decisions. In cases where the parties disagree\non what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of\nrelevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court\nis bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is\nknown as [[stare decisis]]). If, however, the court finds that the current\ndispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \"matter of\nfirst impression\"), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating\nprecedent. Marbury v. Madison, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getca-\nse.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=5&page=137 5 U.S. 137] (1803) (\"It is emphatically\nthe province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those\nwho apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret\nthat rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the\noperation of each.\") Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and\nwill bind future courts.\n\nIn practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the\nsimplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in\na particular jurisdiction, and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts\nhave more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by\nappellate courts are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction and on\nfuture decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are\nonly non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law,\nconstitutional law, statutory law and regulatory law also give rise to\nconsiderable complexity. However, [[stare decisis]], the principle that similar\ncases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that they\nwill reach similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.\n\nOne third of the world's population (approximately 2.3 billion people) live in\ncommon law jurisdictions or in systems mixed with civil law. Particularly common\nlaw is in England where it originated in the Middle Ages, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/188090/English-\nlaw ; British History: Middle Ages  and in countries that trace their\nlegal heritage to England as former colonies of the British Empire, including\nIndia, the United States, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh,\nCanada (with the exception of QuÃ©bec where a mix of civil law (on the provincial\nlevel) and common law (mostly on the federal level) is used), Malaysia, Ghana,\nAustralia, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Singapore, Burma,
