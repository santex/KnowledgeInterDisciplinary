The primary goal of\nstructural geology is to use measurements of present-day rock geometries to\nuncover information about the history of deformation (strain) in the rocks, and\nultimately, to understand the stress field that resulted in the observed strain\nand geometries. This understanding of the dynamics of the stress field can be\nlinked to important events in the regional geologic past; a common goal is to\nunderstand the structural evolution of a particular area with respect to\nregionally widespread patterns of rock deformation (e.g., mountain building,\nrifting) due to plate tectonics.\n","linknr":289,"url":"Structural_geology","recorded":1362371501,"links":43,"instances":["geology","geology","geology","geology","journal","hard_rock","geology","geology","geology","geology","mechanics","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Structural geology|*"],"headings":["Use and importance","Methods","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Grand_Canyon_NP-Arizona-USA.jpg/230px-Grand_Canyon_NP-Arizona-USA.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/StrikeDipPlungeRake.png/350px-StrikeDipPlungeRake.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["deformation","mechanics"],["joint","geology"],["underground_mining","hard_rock"],["bed","geology"],["foliation","geology"],["fault","geology"],["lineation","geology"],["lineation","geology"],["cleavage","geology"],["fold","geology"],["foliation","geology"],["vergence","geology"],["tectonophysics","journal"]],"members":["fold","lineation","foliation","bed","tectonophysics","underground_mining","cleavage","joint","rock","vergence","deformation","fault"],"related":["Rock_(geology)","Deformation_(mechanics)","Stress_field","Orogeny","Rift","Plate_tectonics","Economic_geology","Petroleum_geology","Mining","Stratum","Petroleum","Natural_gas","Hydrothermal","Ore","Intrusive","Igneous","Reef","Sinkhole","Gold","Silver","Copper","Lead","Zinc","Engineering_geology","Joint_(geology)","Dam","Open_pit","Underground_mining_(hard_rock)","Tunnel","Geotechnical","Earthquake","Geomorphology","Karst_topography","Environmental_geology","Hydrogeology","Hydrology","Groundwater","Aquifer","Plate_tectonic","Bed_(geology)","Foliation_(geology)","Fault_(geology)","Lineation_(geology)","Lineation_(geology)","Stereographic_projection","Slickenside","Rock_microstructure","Bedding-plane","Diagenesis","Cleavage_(geology)","Porphyroblast","Geochronology","Terrane","Fold_(geology)","Orogeny","Plate_tectonics","Gas","Mineral","Unconformity","Seismic_tomography","Seismic","Geophysics","Gravity","Metamorphic_rocks","Sedimentary_rocks","Foliation_(geology)","Crenulation","Petrography","Petrographic_microscope","Crenulation","Geomorphology","List_of_rock_textures","Section_restoration","Stereographic_projection","Tectonophysics","Vergence_(geology)","Tectonophysics_(journal)","Elsevier","Journal_of_Structural_Geology","Elsevier"]}
