{"cursor":"869","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn materials science, 'dispersion' is the fraction of atoms of a material\nexposed to the surface. In general:\n\n:D = N S/N T\n\nwhere D is the dispersion, N S is the number of surface atoms and\nN T is the total number of atoms of the material. Dispersion is an\nimportant concept in heterogeneous catalysis, since only atoms that are exposed\nto the surface are able to play a role in catalytic surface reactions.\nDispersion increases with decreasing crystallite size and approaches unity at a\ncrystallite diameter of about 1Â nm.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Dispersion_(materials_science)","recorded":1362553150,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Materials science"],"headings":["Related article"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Zoomed_view_of_carbon_nanotube.svg/40px-Zoomed_view_of_carbon_nanotube.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Materials_science","Catalysis","Emulsion_dispersion"]}
