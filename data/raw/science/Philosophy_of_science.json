{"cursor":"61546","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nThe 'philosophy of science' is concerned with the assumptions, foundations,\nmethods, implications of science, and with the use and merit of science. This\ndiscipline sometimes overlaps metaphysics, ontology and epistemology, viz., when\nit explores whether scientific results comprise a study of truth. In addition to\nthese central problems of science as a whole, many philosophers of science\nconsider problems that apply to particular sciences (e.g. philosophy of biology\nor philosophy of physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary\nresults in science to reach conclusions about philosophy.\n\nPhilosophy of science has historically been met with mixed response from the\nscientific community. Though scientists often contribute to the field, many\nprominent scientists have felt that the practical effect on their work is\nlimited; a popular quote attributed to physicist Richard Feynman goes,\n\"Philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to\nbirds.\" In response, some philosophers (e.g. Craig Callender http://www.philostv.com/craig-callender-and-jonathan-\nschaffer/ ) have suggested that ornithological knowledge would be of great\nbenefit to birds, were it possible for them to possess it.\n","linknr":1654,"url":"Philosophy_of_science","recorded":1362568899,"links":85,"instances":["psychology","philosophy","philosopher","philosophy","sociologist","philosophy","science","mass","author","psychology","philosophy","philosophy","logic","bureaucratic","length","philosopher","physics","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophy
