'Criticism of\n science' is distinct from the academic positions of antiscience or anti-\n intellectualism which seek to reject entirely the scientific method. Rather,\n criticism is made to address and refine problems within the sciences in order\n to improve science as a whole, and its role in society.\n","recorded":1362124693,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"293","instances":["paranormal","science","sociology","international_relations","anthropologist","literature","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Criticisms","Science","Evolution","Philosophy","Politics"],"headings":["Philosophical critiques","Feminist critiques","Media perspectives","Politics","See also","Notes and references","Further reading"],"tags":[["magic","paranormal"],["meaning","linguistics"],["power","sociology"],["emily_martin","anthropologist"],["magic","paranormal"],["meaning","linguistics"],["power","sociology"],["emily_martin","anthropologist"],["positivism","international_relations"],["objectivity","science"],["naturalism","literature"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SciencePersonificationBoston.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/SciencePersonificationBoston.jpg/220px-SciencePersonificationBoston.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SciencePersonificationBoston.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Feyerabend_Berkeley.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Paul_Feyerabend_Berkeley.jpg/200px-Paul_Feyerabend_Berkeley.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_Feyerabend_Berkeley.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_an_Air_Pump_by_Joseph_Wright_of_Derby,_1768.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_an_Air_Pump_by_Joseph_Wright_of_Derby%2C_1768.jpg/220px-An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_an_Air_Pump_by_Joseph_Wright_of_Derby%2C_1768.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:An_Experiment_on_a_Bird_in_an_Air_Pump_by_Joseph_Wright_of_Derby,_1768.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Boston_Public_Library","Science","Antiscience","Anti-intellectualism","Paul_K_Feyerabend","Epistemological_anarchism","Methodology","Scientific_progress","Knowledge","Ideology","Religion","Education","Magic_(paranormal)","Mythology","Authoritarian","Imre_Lakatos","Demarcation_problem","Pseudoscience","Steven_Jay_Gould","Time's_Arrow,_Time's_Cycle","Begging_the_question","Jacques_Barzun","Faith","Fanaticism","History","Meaning_(linguistics)","Human","Stanley_Aronowitz","Fundamentalist_Christianity","Bible","Alan_Watts","Abrahamic_religions","God","Logos","Epistemology","Divination","Polymath","Discordianism","Robert_Anton_Wilson","Ecophenomenology","Nature","Metaphysics","Philosophy","Temporality","Teleology","Ethics","Bernard_Rollin","Social_science","Anthropologist","Tim_Ingold","Philosophy","Humanities","Adorno","Critical_theory","Humanities","The_arts","Carolyn_Merchant","Theodor_Adorno","E._F._Schumacher","Scientific_revolution","Nature","Wisdom","Power_(sociology)","Emily_Martin_(anthropologist)","Evelyn_Fox_Keller","Ruth_Hubbard","Londa_Schiebinger","Gender_bias","Ruth_Hubbard","Evelyn_Fox_Keller","Rhetoric_of_science","Human_fertilization","Johns_Hopkins","Mass_media","Scientific_debate","Beat_reporter","Politician","Mass_media","United_Kingdom","MMR_vaccine","Edwina_Currie","Zoologist","Peter_Kropotkin","Capitalism","Robert_Anton_Wilson","Stanley_Aronowitz","Paul_Feyerabend","Military-industrial_complex","Corporation","Theodore_Kaczynski","Primitivist","Reductionism","Feminism","Nicholas_Rescher"],"members":["magic","objectivity","power","positivism","emily_martin","naturalism","meaning"],"book":[]}
