NSA is a\nkey component of the U.S. Intelligence Community, which is headed by the\nDirector of National Intelligence. The Central Security Service is a co-located\nagency created to coordinate intelligence activities and co-operation between\nNSA and other U.S. military cryptanalysis agencies. The Director of the National\nSecurity Agency serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and\nChief of the Central Security Service.\n\nBy law, NSA's intelligence gathering is limited to foreign communications,\nalthough domestic incidents such as the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy\nhave occurred.\n\nThe National Security Agency is divided into two major missions: the Signals\nIntelligence Directorate (SID), which produces foreign signals intelligence\ninformation, and the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD), which protects\nU.S. information systems.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"national_security_agency","recorded":1371065263,"links":[],"instances":["computer","united_states","computing","usa","company","cipher_machine","computer","writer","cryptography","software","information_gathering","journalist","general","law","company","signals_intelligence","united_states","united_states","cipher","cryptographer","nsa","surveillance_program"],"pdf":[],"categories":["National
