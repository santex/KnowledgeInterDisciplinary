The film explores the fate of the doomed mission, including John Rae's\nefforts to uncover the truth, and Lady Franklin's campaign to defend her late\nhusband's reputation. The film also features Inuit statesman Tagak Curley, who\nchallenges claims made by Lady Franklin supported by her powerful friend, the\nstory teller and \"famous author Charles\nDickens\", widely reported at the time, that Aboriginal people were responsible\nfor the signs of cannibalism among the remains of the doomed crew.\n\nIt premiered at the Hot Docs film festival in Toronto, Canada in April 2008.\n\nPassage has two main storylines. The first shows John Walker and crew, making an\nhistorical fiction film; it includes script readings, discussions and scenes\nfrom the film they are making. The second story line is completely non-fiction.\nIt includes paintings with narratives, cast and crew visiting the places Rae\nknew (Orkney, the Arctic) and Inuit culture and experts.\n\nThe film was written, directed and narrated by John Walker. It stars Rick\nRoberts as John Rae and Geraldine Alexander as Lady Franklin.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Passage_(2008_film)","recorded":1362674703,"links":16,"instances":["explorer","actor","lady_franklin","canadian_filmmaker"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Canadian films","Canadian documentary films","Documentary films about historical events","National Film Board of Canada documentaries","Inuit film","Documentary films about disasters","Films set in Canada","Documentary films about the Arctic","2008 films","2000s documentary films"],"headings":["Reception","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Canadafilm.svg/30px-Canadafilm.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Historicalfilm.png/30px-Historicalfilm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rick_roberts","actor"],["john_rae","explorer"],["jane_griffin","lady_franklin"],["john_walker","canadian_filmmaker"],["rick_roberts","actor"]],"members":["john_rae","rick_roberts","jane_griffin","john_walker"],"related":["Andrea_Nemtin","Kent_Martin","Andrew_Rai_Berzins","Rick_Roberts_(actor)","Kent_Nason","Jeff_Warren","John_Brett","National_Film_Board_of_Canada","Franklin's_lost_expedition","Northwest_Passage","John_Rae_(explorer)","Jane_Griffin_(Lady_Franklin)","Inuit","Tagak_Curley","Charles_Dickens","Cannibalism","Hot_Docs","Orkney","John_Walker_(Canadian_filmmaker)","Rick_Roberts_(actor)","Banff_World_Television_Festival","Martin_Knelman"]}
