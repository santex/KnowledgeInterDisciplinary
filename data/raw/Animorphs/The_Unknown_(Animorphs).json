It is narrated by Cassie.The front cover quote is, \"Never\nunderestimate the power of a morph....\". All books after The Unknown were\ndedicated to Applegate's son, Jake, as well as her husband and co-writer,\nMichael. It is assumed that the horse featured on this cover is Minneapolis Max,\nand not the horse that Cassie acquired as her first morph (which would make this\nthe fifth book to feature a cover morph that was not acquired in the book),\ndespite not fitting Max's description.\n","linknr":271,"url":"The_Unknown_(Animorphs)","recorded":1362482545,"links":16,"instances":["animorphs","animorphs","animorphs","animorphs","animorphs","animorphs"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animorphs books","1998 novels"],"headings":["Plot summary","Re-release","Morphs"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4d/Animorphs_14_The_Unknown.jpg/175px-Animorphs_14_The_Unknown.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cassie","animorphs"],["the_change","animorphs"],["the_escape","animorphs"],["cassie","animorphs"],["rachel","animorphs"],["tobias","animorphs"],["cassie","animorphs"],["marco","animorphs"]],"members":["cassie","rachel","the_escape","marco","tobias","the_change"],"related":["Cassie_(Animorphs)","Horse","K._A._Applegate","David_Burroughs_Mattingly","Scholastic_Press","The_Change_(Animorphs)","The_Escape_(Animorphs)","Animorphs","K.A._Applegate","Cassie_(Animorphs)","Martians","Galard","Lingua_franca","Gondor","The_Lord_of_the_Rings","The_Return_of_the_King","Jake_Berenson","Horse","Seagull","Peregrine_Falcon","Great_Horned_Owl","Siberian_Tiger","Rachel_(Animorphs)","Horse","Bald_Eagle","Cockroach","Seagull","Great_Horned_Owl","Grizzly_Bear","Tobias_(Animorphs)","Horse","Human","Red-tailed_Hawk","Cassie_(Animorphs)","Osprey","Cockroach","Seagull","Great_Horned_Owl","Wolf","Marco_(Animorphs)","Horse","Osprey","Cockroach","Seagull","Great_Horned_Owl","Gorilla","Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill","Horse","Human","Northern_Harrier","Great_Horned_Owl","Rattlesnake"]}
