{"cursor":"5914","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the mathematical field of set theory, an 'ideal' is a collection of sets that\nare considered to be \"small\" or \"negligible\". Every subset of an element of the\nideal must also be in the ideal (this codifies the idea that an ideal is a\nnotion of smallness), and the union of any two elements of the ideal must also\nbe in the ideal.\n\nMore formally, given a set X, an ideal on X is a nonempty subset I of the\npowerset of X, such that:\n# if A ∈ I and B â A, then B ∈ I, and if A,B ∈ I, then A∪B\n# ∈ I.\nSome authors add a third condition that X itself is not in I; ideals with this\nextra property are called 'proper ideals'.\n\nIdeals in the set-theoretic sense are exactly ideals in the order-theoretic\nsense, where the relevant order is set inclusion. Also, they are exactly ideals\nin the ring-theoretic sense on the Boolean ring formed by the powerset of the\nunderlying set.\n","linknr":123,"url":"Ideal_(set_theory)","recorded":1362567818,"links":11,"instances":["structure","set_theory","ring_theory","set_theory","mathematics","combinatorics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Set theory"],"headings":["Terminology","Examples of ideals","Operations on ideals","Relationships among ideals","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/4/0/3404f89309df906e697768c5cacda488.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/e/b/cebaec0615096c36256c568b579f54cd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/b/4/ab4fe27b8fcfb201a2aafb24f336aae9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/f/0/5f06877b66767ea379797e7e6b47d98a.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["union","set_theory"],["ideal","order_theory"],["ideal","ring_theory"],["small_set","combinatorics"],["boolean_algebra","structure"],["filter","set_theory"],["image","mathematics"]],"members":["boolean_algebra","filter","ideal","union","image","small_set"],"related":["Set_theory","Subset","Union_(set_theory)","Powerset","Ideal_(order_theory)","Ideal_(ring_theory)","Boolean_ring","Finite_set","Measure_space","Measure_space","Counting_measure","Natural_number","Small_set_(combinatorics)","Asymptotic_density","Real_number","Lebesgue_measure","Meager_set","Ordinal_number","Cofinality","Stationary_set","W._Hugh_Woodin","Cartesian_product","Equivalence_relation","Symmetric_difference","Quotient_set","Boolean_algebra_(structure)","Filter_(set_theory)","Relative_complement","Bijection","Image_(mathematics)","Σ-ideal"]}
