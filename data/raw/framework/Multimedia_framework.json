{"cursor":"2014","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA '[[multimedia]] framework' is a software framework that handles media on a\ncomputer and through a network. A good multimedia framework offers an intuitive\nAPI and a modular architecture to easily add support for new audio, video and\ncontainer formats and transmission protocols. It is meant to be used by\napplications such as media players and audio or video editors, but can also be\nused to build videoconferencing applications, media converters and other\nmultimedia tools.\n\nIn contrast to function libraries, a multimedia framework provides a run time\nenvironment for the media processing. Ideally such an environment provides\nexecution contexts for the media processing blocks separated from the\napplication using the framework. The separation supports the independent\nprocessing of multimedia data in a timely manner. These separate contexts can be\nimplemented as threads.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Multimedia_framework","recorded":1362559139,"links":22,"instances":["computer_science","digital","kde","computing","application_software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Multimedia software","Multimedia frameworks|"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Vista-multimedia.png/35px-Vista-multimedia.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["container_format","digital"],["media_player","application_software"],["library","computing"],["thread","computer_science"],["phonon","kde"]],"members":["thread","container_format","phonon","library","media_player"],"related":["Software_framework","Electronic_media","Application_programming_interface","Container_format_(digital)","Streaming_media","Media_player_(application_software)","Digital_audio_editor","Video_editor","Videoconferencing","Library_(computing)","Run-time_system","Thread_(computer_science)","GStreamer","Phonon_(KDE)","DirectShow","Media_Foundation","QuickTime","Mac_OS_X","Microsoft_Windows","VLC_Media_Player","VideoLAN"]}
