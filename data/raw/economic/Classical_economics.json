{"cursor":"15477","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Classical economics' is widely regarded as the first modern school of economic\nthought. Its major developers include Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, David\nRicardo, Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill.\n\nAdam Smith's [[The Wealth of Nations]] in 1776 is usually considered to mark the\nbeginning of classical economics. The school was active into the mid 19th\ncentury and was followed by neoclassical economics in Britain beginning around\n1870, or, in Marx's definition by \"vulgar political economy\" from the 1830s. The\ndefinition of classical economics is debated, particularly the period 1830â70\nand the connection to neoclassical economics. The term \"classical economics\" was\ncoined by Karl Marx to refer to Ricardian economics â the economics of David\nRicardo and James Mill and their predecessors â but usage was subsequently\nextended to include the followers of Ricardo. [[The General\nTheory of Employment, Interest and Money]], John Maynard Keynes, Chapter 1, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-\ntheory/ch01.htm#1 Footnote 1]\n\nClassical economists claimed that free markets regulate themselves, when free of\nany intervention. Adam Smith referred to a so-called invisible hand, which will\nmove markets towards their natural equilibrium, without requiring any outside\nintervention.\n\nAs opposed to Keynesian economics, classical economics assumes flexible prices\nboth in the case of goods and wages. Another main assumption is based on Say's\nLaw: supply creates its own demand - that is, aggregate production will generate\nan income enough to purchase all the output produced; this implicitly assumes,\nin contrast to Keynes, that there will be net saving or spending of cash or\nfinancial instruments. Another postulate of classical economics is the equality\nof savings and investment, assuming that flexible interest rates will always\nmaintain equilibrium.\n","linknr":334,"url":"Classical_economics","recorded":1362560669,"links":44,"instances":["economics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Adam Smith","History of economic thought","Classical economics|*"],"headings":["History","Classical theories of growth and development","Value theory","Monetary theory","Debates on the definition of classical economics","See also","Notes","External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interest","economics"],["theory_of_value","economics"]],"members":["theory_of_value","interest"],"related":["History_of_economic_thought","Adam_Smith","Jean-Baptiste_Say","David_Ricardo","Thomas_Malthus","John_Stuart_Mill","Neoclassical_economics","Karl_Marx","Ricardian_economics","James_Mill","John_Maynard_Keynes","Keynesian_economics","Capitalism","Feudalism","Industrial_revolution","Adam_Smith","Physiocrat","Francois_Quesnay","The_Wealth_of_Nations","Wages","Economic_rent","Interest_(economics)","Keynesian_economics","Keynesian_revolution","Neoclassical_synthesis","Heterodox_economics","Marxian_economics","Austrian_economics","John_Hicks","Samuel_Hollander","Nicholas_Kaldor","Luigi_Pasinetti","Paul_A._Samuelson","William_Petty","Market_price","Natural_price","Labour_theory_of_value","Cost_of_production_theory_of_value","Labour_theory_of_value","Piero_Sraffa","Krishna_Bharadwaj","Demography","Neoclassical_economics","Free_trade","Marginalist","Marginal_utility","Opportunity_cost","Marxian","British_Banking_School","Currency_school","Nicholas_Kaldor","Milton_Friedman","Endogenous_money","Theory_of_value_(economics)","Neoclassical_economics","Neo-Ricardianism","Discontinuity_thesis","Abstinence_theory_of_interest","Say's_law","Joseph_A._Schumpeter","Samuel_Hollander","Supply_and_demand","Alfred_Marshall","Samuel_Hollander","Say's_law","Keynesian_economics","William_Petty","Johann_Heinrich_von_Thünen","Classical_general_equilibrium_model","Neoclassical_economics","Classical_liberalism","Constitutional_economics","Perspectives_on_Capitalism","Mark_Blaug","Samuel_Hollander"]}
