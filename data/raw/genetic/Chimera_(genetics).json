{"cursor":"28136","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] A 'chimera' or chimaera is a single organism (usually an animal) that is\ncomposed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that\noriginated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction. If the\ndifferent cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a\nmosaic. Chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilized eggs\nor early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own\ncharacter and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Chimeras are\ntypically seen in animals; there are some reports of human chimerism.\n\nThis condition is either inherited, or it is acquired through the infusion of\nallogeneic hematopoietic cells during transplantation or transfusion. In\nnonidentical twins, chimerism occurs by means of blood-vessel anastomoses. The\nlikelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via in\nvitro fertilization. Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of\noffspring depends on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying\ndegrees of intersexuality may result if one set of cells is genetically female\nand another genetically male.\n","linknr":396,"url":"Chimera_(genetics)","recorded":1362900700,"links":46,"instances":["genetics","anatomy","biology","biology","plant"],"pdf":["http://www.bmj.com/content/2/4827/81.full.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/2/4827/81.full.pdf","http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.149.9001&rep=rep1&type=pdf","http://www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_Sanger.pdf"],"categories":["Reproduction","Intersexuality"],"headings":["Tetragametic chimerism","Microchimerism","\"Parasitic\" chimerism in anglerfish","Germline chimerism","Human chimeras","Chimeras in research","Mouse chimeras","Legislation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg/220px-ChimericMouseWithPups.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["mosaic","genetics"],["organ","anatomy"],["hybrid","biology"],["chimera","plant"],["mosaic","genetics"]],"members":["mosaic","organ","hybrid","cell","chimera"],"related":["Organism","Animal","Cell_(biology)","Zygote","Sexual_reproduction","Mosaic_(genetics)","Human","Allogeneic","Hematopoietic_cell","Organ_transplant","Blood_transfusion","Anastomose","In_vitro_fertilization","Intersex","Blastocyst","Twin","Hermaphroditic","Organ_(anatomy)","Chromosome","Liver","Kidney","Marmoset","Fraternal_twin","Blaschko's_lines","Ambiguous_genitalia","Hermaphroditism","Eye_pigmentation","Heterochromia","Ovary","Testis","Ovotestes","Intersexuality","Tortoiseshell_cat","Lydia_Fairchild","Stem_cell","Immunologic_tolerance","Ceratiidae","Anglerfish","Hermaphrodite","Testicle","Atrophy","Sperm","Ovum","Marmoset","In-vitro_fertilization","Lydia_Fairchild","Tyler_Hamilton","Hybrid_(biology)","Gametes","Zygote","Hybridoma_technology","Geep","Embryo","Goat","Sheep","Shanghai_Second_Medical_University","Rabbit","Stem_cell","University_of_Nevada,_Reno","Ethics","Strategic_Foresight_Group","House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom","Blaschko's_lines","Chimera_(plant)","Genetic_chimerism_in_fiction","Lydia_Fairchild","Mosaic_(genetics)","Parahuman","Vanishing_twin","Conjoined_twins","X-inactivation"]}
