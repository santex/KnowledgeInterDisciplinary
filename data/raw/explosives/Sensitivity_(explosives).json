All explosive\ncompounds have a certain amount of energy required to initiate. If an explosive\nis too sensitive, it may go off accidentally. A safer explosive is less\nsensitive and will not explode if accidentally dropped or mishandled. However,\nsuch explosives are more difficult to initiate intentionally.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Sensitivity_(explosives)","recorded":1362482518,"links":15,"instances":["mechanics","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Explosives"],"headings":["Explosive train","Classifications","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg/35px-Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["impact","mechanics"],["shock","mechanics"]],"members":["shock","impact"],"related":["Explosive","Impact_(mechanics)","Heat","Friction","Stability","Brisance","Detonator","Blasting_cap","Explosive_materials","Chain_reaction","Explosive_train","Initiation_sequence","Firing_train","High_explosives","Shock_(mechanics)"]}
