A 'clockwise' (typically\nabbreviated as 'CW') motion is one that proceeds in the same direction as a\nclock's hands: from the top to the right, then down and then to the left, and\nback up to the top. The opposite sense of rotation or revolution is (in\nCommonwealth English) 'anticlockwise' ('ACW'), or (in North American English)\n'counterclockwise' ('CCW'). In a mathematical sense, a circle defined\nparametrically in a positive Cartesian plane by the equations and is traced\ncounterclockwise as t increases in value.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Clockwise_and_counterclockwise","recorded":1362482755,"links":32,"instances":["hardware","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Orientation"],"headings":["Origin of the term","Usage","In humans","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Clockwise_arrow.svg/220px-Clockwise_arrow.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Counterclockwise_arrow.svg/220px-Counterclockwise_arrow.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nut","hardware"],["chirality","physics"],["chirality","chemistry"]],"members":["nut","chirality"],"related":["Circular_motion","Clock","Rotation","Revolution","Commonwealth_English","North_American_English","Sunwise","Scottish_Gaelic","Widdershins","Middle_Low_German","Earth","North_Pole","South_Pole","Sundial","Sun","MÃ¼nster_Cathedral","Judaism","Hebrew_language","Nut_(hardware)","Screw","Bottle_cap","Right-hand_rule","Supination","Pronation","Automobile","Lug_nut","Bicycle_pedal","Spinning_wheel","Turnbuckle","Acetylene","Trigonometry","Mathematics","Angle","Radian","Navigation","Compass","Handedness","Chirality_(physics)","Chirality_(chemistry)","Inner/Outer_orientation","Optical_isomerism","Retrograde_motion","Relative_direction"]}
