{"cursor":"37321","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cultural anthropology' is a branch of anthropology focused on the study of\ncultural variation among humans, collecting data about the impact of global\neconomic and political processes on local cultural realities. Anthropologists\nuse a variety of methods, including participant observation, interviews and\nsurveys. Their research is often called fieldwork because it involves the\nanthropologist spending an extended period of time at the research\nlocation. \"In his earlier work, like many anthropologists of this\ngeneration, Levi-Strauss draws attention to the necessary and urgent task of\nmaintaining and extending the empirical foundations of anthropology in the\npractice of fieldwork.\": In Christopher Johnson, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NIJHaX0u-\nhUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Claude Levi-Strauss: the formative\nyears], Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.31\n\nOne of the earliest articulations of the anthropological meaning of the term\n\"culture\" came from Sir Edward Tylor who writes on the first page of his 1897\nbook: âCulture, or civilization, taken in its broad, ethnographic sense, is that\ncomplex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and\nany other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of\nsociety.â Tylor, Edward. 1920 [1871]. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V-\nxZMk2PEUsoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Primitive Culture]. Vol 1. New\nYork: J.P. Putnamâs Sons. The term \"civilization\" later gave way to\ndefinitions by V. Gordon Childe, with culture forming an umbrella term and\ncivilization becoming a particular kind of culture. Sherratt, Andrew V.\n\"Gordon Childe: Archaeology and Intellectual History\", Past and Present, No.\n125. (Nov., 1989), pp. 151â185.\n\nThe anthropological concept of \"culture\" reflects in part a reaction against\nearlier Western discourses based on an opposition between \"culture\" and\n\"nature\", according to which some human beings lived in a \"state of nature\".\nAnthropologists have argued that culture is \"human nature\", and that all people\nhave a capacity to classify experiences, encode classifications symbolically\n(i.e. in language), and teach such abstractions to others.\n\nSince humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and\nsocialization, people living in different places or different circumstances\ndevelop different cultures. Anthropologists have also pointed out that through\nculture people can adapt to their environment in non-genetic ways, so people\nliving in different environments will often have different cultures. Much of\nanthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of and interest in the\ntension between the local (particular cultures) and the global (a universal\nhuman nature, or the web of connections between people in distinct\nplaces/circumstances).\n\nThe rise of cultural anthropology occurred within the context of the late 19th\ncentury, when questions regarding which cultures were \"primitive\" and which were\n\"civilized\" occupied the minds of not only Marx and Freud, but many others.\nColonialism and its processes increasingly brought European thinkers in contact,\ndirectly or indirectly with \"primitive others.\" Rosaldo, Renato. Culture and\nTruth. 1993. Beach Press. The relative status of various humans, some of\nwhom had modern advanced technologies that included engines and telegraphs,\nwhile others lacked anything but face-to-face communication techniques and still\nlived a Paleolithic lifestyle, was of interest to the first generation of\ncultural anthropologists.\n\nParallel with the rise of cultural anthropology in the United States, social\nanthropology, in which sociality is the central concept and which focuses on the\nstudy of social statuses and roles, groups, institutions, and the relations\namong them, developed as an academic discipline in Britain. An umbrella term socio-\ncultural anthropology makes reference to both cultural and social anthropology\ntraditions. Campbell, D.T.
