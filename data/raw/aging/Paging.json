In the paging memory-management scheme, the operating system\nretrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. The main\nadvantage of paging over memory segmentation is that it allows the physical\naddress space of a process to be noncontiguous. Before paging came into use,\nsystems had to fit whole programs into storage contiguously, which caused\nvarious storage and fragmentation problems. {{Cite book\n  | contribution = Virtual memory systems title = Encyclopedia of computer\n  | science and technology editor1-last = Belzer editor1-first = Jack editor2-\n  | last = Holzman editor2-first = Albert G. editor3-last = Kent editor3-first =\n  | Allen publisher = CRC Press volume=14 page = 32 year = 1981 url =\n  | http://books.google.com/?id=KUgNGCJB4agC&printsec=frontcover isbn = 0-8247-2214-\n  | 0 postscript =  }}\n\nPaging is an important part of virtual memory implementation in most\ncontemporary general-purpose operating systems, allowing them to use disk\nstorage for data that does not fit into physical random-access memory (RAM).\n","linknr":505,"url":"Paging","recorded":1362551505,"links":38,"instances":["mathematics","manchester","operating_system","unix","computer_science","computer","computer_science","data_storage","memory","computing"],"pdf":["http://people.msoe.edu/~durant/courses/cs384/papers0405/mccrawt.pdf"],"categories":["Virtual memory","Memory management"],"headings":["Overview","Page replacement algorithms","Thrashing","Sharing","Terminology","Implementations","Performance","Tuning swap space size","Reliability","Addressing limits on 32-bit hardware","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["block","data_storage"],["fragmentation","computer"],["instruction","computer_science"],["sync","unix"],["thrashing","computer_science"],["cache","computing"],["segmentation","memory"],["atlas_computer","manchester"],["solaris","operating_system"],["magnitude","mathematics"],["solaris","operating_system"],["segmentation","memory"]],"members":["magnitude","atlas_computer","solaris","sync","instruction","fragmentation","thrashing","block","segmentation","cache"],"related":["Computer","Operating_system","Memory_management","Block_(data_storage)","Memory_segmentation","Contiguously","Computer_data_storage","Fragmentation_(computer)","Virtual_memory","Random-access_memory","Page_fault","Page_frame","Page_table","Instruction_(computer_science)","Page_replacement_algorithm","Least_recently_used","Working_set","Page_fault","Locality_of_reference","MVS","Sync_(Unix)","Locality_of_reference","Working_set","Page_fault","Thrashing_(computer_science)","IBM_System/360_Model_67","IBM_System/370","Cache_(computing)","Silly_window_syndrome","Multi-programming","Multi-user","Primary_storage","Data","Junction_table","Memory_allocation","Segmentation_(memory)","Roll-in/roll-out","Memory-mapped_files","Windows_NT","Atlas_Computer_(Manchester)","Ferranti","University_of_Manchester","Plessey","Content-addressable_memory","Microsoft_Windows","Windows_3.0","Hidden_file","Root_directory","Windows_Control_Panel","Blue_Screen_of_Death","Error_message","Windows_95","Windows_98","Windows_Me","Windows_NT","Windows_XP","Windows_Vista","Windows_7","Blue_Screen_of_Death","File_system_fragmentation","Defragment","Unix","Unix-like","Scratch_disk","Red_Hat","Redundant_array_of_independent_disks","OS_X","John_Siracusa","Solaris_(operating_system)","ZFS","AmigaOS_4.0","Slab_allocation","AmigaOS_4.1","Magnitude_(mathematics)","Random_access_memory","Access_time","Page_cache","Rotational_latency","Volatile_memory","ReadyBoost","Intel_Turbo_Memory","Unix-like","AIX","Linux","Solaris_(operating_system)","Address_bus","32-bit_clean","Address_map","X86","Physical_Address_Extension","IBM_System/370","Virtual_address_space","IBM_System/370","IBM_ESA/390","Physical_Address_Extension","Page_cache","Physical_memory","Virtual_memory","Demand_paging","Page_cache","Page_replacement_algorithm","Segmentation_(memory)","Page_size","Page_table","Memory_allocation","Expanded_memory"]}
