{"cursor":"23317","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'biological patent' is a patent relating to an invention or discovery in\nbiology. It can be a composition of matter, a method for obtaining or using one\nor more thereof, or a product combining such things. As with all utility patents\nin the U.S, the patent provides the patent holder with the right to exclude\nothers from making, using, selling, or importing the claimed invention for a\nlimited period of time - for patents filed after 1998, twenty years from the\nfiling date. Natural biological substances themselves can be patented\n(apart from any associated process or usage) in the United States if they are\nsufficiently \"isolated\" from their naturally occurring states. Prominent\nhistorical examples of such patents on isolated products of nature include\nadrenaline, insulin, vitamin B 12 , and gene patents.\n","linknr":366,"url":"Gene_patent","recorded":1362374195,"links":22,"instances":["law_professor","herbicide","patent","united_kingdom","patent","genetics"],"pdf":["http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/biotech/12H.pdf","http://www.iphandbook.org/handbook/chPDFs/ch17/ipHandbook-Ch%2017%2022%20Feldman-Colaianni0Liu%20Cohen-Boyer%20Patents%20and%20Licenses.pdf","http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj009/05_09/05_3069.pdf","http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20100329_patent_opinion.pdf","http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20100329_patent_opinion.pdf","http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RL30648.pdf","http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RL31142.pdf"],"categories":["Applied genetics","Patent law","Science and law","Genetics","Biological patent law","Science and law"],"headings":["History","Gene patents","Controversy","Myriad Genetics case","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["roundup","herbicide"],["claim","patent"],["transformation","genetics"],["medical_research_council","united_kingdom"],["john_moore","patent"],["michael_heller","law_professor"],["john_moore","patent"]],"members":["michael_heller","roundup","john_moore","medical_research_council","claim","transformation"],"related":["Patent","Invention","Biology","Adrenaline","Learned_Hand","Recombinant_DNA","United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","Genetically_modified_organisms","Oncomouse","Plant_breeders'_rights","Patent","Utility_model","Monsanto_Company","Glyphosate","Gene","Canola","Roundup_(herbicide)","Herbicide","Monsanto_Canada_Inc._v._Schmeiser","University_of_California","Genome","Scientific_American","Gene","Chemical_composition","Claim_(patent)","General_Electric","Human_growth_hormone","Stanley_Norman_Cohen","Herbert_Boyer","Richard_Axel","Cotransformation","Transformation_(genetics)","Monoclonal_antibodies","Medical_Research_Council_(United_Kingdom)","BRCA1","BRCA_mutation","BRCA2","Association_for_Molecular_Pathology_v._Myriad_Genetics","Myriad_Genetics","Monsanto","Stem_cells","Public_Patent_Foundation","European_Patent_Office","John_Moore_(patent)","Biological_immortality","Michael_Heller_(law_professor)","Rebecca_Eisenberg","Tragedy_of_the_anticommons","Pathologists","BRCA1","BRCA2","Extraordinary_Measures","Patentable_subject_matter","Gene_patent","Patent","Myriad_Genetics","DNA_extraction","DNA","United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York","Patentable_subject_matter","United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Federal_Circuit","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","American_Type_Culture_Collection","Biopiracy","Budapest_Treaty","Diamond_v._Chakrabarty","United_States_Supreme_Court","Genetically_modified_organism","Patent","Gene_patent","Human_Genome_Project","John_Moore_(patent)","Pharmaceutical_patent","Stem_cell_controversy","World_Intellectual_Property_Organization"]}
