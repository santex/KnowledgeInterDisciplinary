ÏÎµÏÏÏÏ, \"digested\", derived from ÏÎ­ÏÏÎµÎ¹Î½, \"to digest\") are\nshort chains of amino acid monomers linked by peptide (amide) bonds, the\ncovalent chemical bonds formed when the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts\nwith the amino group of another. Peptides are distinguished from proteins on the\nbasis of size, and as a benchmark can be understood to contain approximately 50\namino acids or less. The shortest peptides are dipeptides, consisting of 2 amino\nacids joined by a single peptide bond, followed by tripeptides, tetrapeptides,\netc. A polypeptide is a long, continuous, and unbranched peptide chain. Hence,\npeptides fall under the broad chemical classes of biological oligomers and\npolymers, alongside nucleic acids, oligo- and polysaccharides, etc.\n\nProteins consist of one or more polypeptides arranged in a biologically\nfunctional way, often bound to ligands such as coenzymes and cofactors, or to\nanother protein or other macromolecule (DNA, RNA, etc.), or to complex\nmacromolecular assemblies. Finally, while aspects of the techniques that apply\nto peptides versus polypeptides and proteins differ (i.e., in the specifics of\nelectrophoresis, chromatography, etc.), the size boundaries that distinguish\npeptides from polypeptides and proteins are not hard and fast: long peptides\nsuch as amyloid beta have been referred to as proteins, and smaller proteins\nlike insulin have been considered peptides.\n\nAmino acids that have been incorporated into peptides are termed \"residues\"; all\npeptides except cyclic peptides have an N-terminal and C-terminal residue at the\nend of the peptide (as shown for the tetrapeptide in the image).\n","linknr":530,"url":"Polypeptide","recorded":1362508410,"links":59,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peptides|"],"headings":["Peptide classes","Peptide synthesis","Peptides in molecular biology","Well-known peptide families in humans","Notes on terminology","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png/300px-Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Peptide_Synthesis.svg/900px-Peptide_Synthesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cofactor","biochemistry"],["translation","biology"],["modularity","biology"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["cofactor","modularity","translation"],"related":["Glycine","Serine","Alanine","N-terminus","C-terminus","Amino_acid","Monomer","Peptide_bond","Amide","Covalent","Chemical_bond","Carboxyl","Amino","Protein","Dipeptide","Tripeptide","Tetrapeptide","Polypeptide","Oligomer","Polymer","Nucleic_acid","Polysaccharide","Ligand","Coenzyme","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Macromolecule","DNA","RNA","Macromolecular_assemblies","Electrophoresis","Chromatography","Amyloid_beta","Insulin","Cyclic_peptide","N-terminus","C-terminus","Milk_peptides","Lactobacillus","Translation_(biology)","MRNA","Proteolysis","Hormone","Antibiotic","Microcins","Amino_acid","Posttranslational_modification","Phosphorylation","Hydroxylation","Sulfonation","Disulfide_bridge","Lariat","Platypus_venom","Nonribosomal_peptide","Enzyme","Glutathione","Antioxidant","Unicellular_organism","Plant","Fungi","Modularity_(biology)","Cyclic_compound","Fatty_acid","Polyketide","Oxazoles","Thiazoles","Fmoc","Amine","Amino_acid","Protein","Mass_spectrometry","In-gel_digestion","Electrophoresis","Protein_structure","Protein_tags","Substance_P","Kassinin","Neurokinin_A","Eledoisin","Neurokinin_B","Vasoactive_intestinal_peptide","Pituitary_adenylate_cyclase_activating_peptide","Peptide_PHI","Growth_hormone_releasing_hormone","Glucagon","Secretin","NPY","Peptide_YY","Avian_pancreatic_polypeptide","Pancreatic_polypeptide","Proopiomelanocortin","POMC","Enkephalin","Prodynorphin","Calcitonin","Amylin","AGG01","Brain_natriuretic_peptide","Lactotripeptides","Blood_pressure","Oxytocin","Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone","Lipid","Hormone","Proteose","Antineoplaston","Argireline","Beefy_meaty_peptide","Bis-peptide","Epidermal_Growth_Factor","Lactotripeptides","Pancreatic_hormone","Peptide_Spectral_Library","Peptide_synthesis","Peptidomimetic","Peptoid","Beta-peptide","Protein_tag","Ribosome","Translation_(genetics)"]}
