{"cursor":"7820","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'Internet meme' ( ) is a concept that spreads from person to person via the\nInternet. The concept of a meme was defined and\ndescribed by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book [[The Selfish Gene]], as an\nattempt to explain the way cultural information spreads;\ninternet memes are a subset of this, specific to the culture and environment of\nthe internet.\n\nFads and sensations tend to grow rapidly on the Internet, because the instant\ncommunication facilitates word of mouth transmission. In the early days of the\nInternet, such content was primarily spread via email or Usenet discussion\ncommunities. Messageboards and newsgroups were also popular because they allowed\na simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse\npopulation of internet users. They encourage communication between people, and\nthus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they\nactively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by\nasking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. Another factor in the increased\nmeme transmission observed over the internet is its interactive nature. Print\nmatter, radio, and television are all essentially passive experiences requiring\nthe reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing;\nin contrast the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more\nreadily. Many phenomena are also spread via web search engines, internet forums,\nsocial networking services, social news sites, and video hosting services. Much\nof the Internet's ability to spread information is assisted from results found\nthrough search engines, which can allow users to find memes even with obscure\ninformation.\n","linknr":203,"url":"Internet_meme","recorded":1362485809,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Internet memes|","Words coined in the 1990s"],"headings":["Description","Types and uses","See also","Further reading","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png/28px-Crystal_Clear_app_browser.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Internet","Meme","Richard_Dawkins","Internet_culture","Word_of_mouth","Usenet","Internet_forum","Usenet_newsgroup","Publishing","Radio","Television","Web_search_engine","Internet_forum","Social_networking_service","Social_news","Video_hosting_service","Image","Hyperlink","Video","Picture","Website","Hashtag","Misspelling","Teh","Social_network","Blog","Email","Internet_culture","Subculture","4chan","Reddit","Parody","Viral_marketing","Viral_marketing","Guerrilla_marketing","Marketing_buzz","Memetics","Fad","Buzzword","FreeCreditReport.com","Chuck_Testa","Dumb_Ways_to_Die","Metro_Trains_Melbourne","Cliché","List_of_Internet_phenomena","Remix_culture"]}
