{"cursor":"10896","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'network socket' is an endpoint of an inter-process communication flow across\na computer network. Today, most communication between computers is based on the\nInternet Protocol; therefore most network sockets are 'Internet sockets'.\n\nA 'socket API' is an application programming interface (API), usually provided\nby the operating system, that allows application programs to control and use\nnetwork sockets. Internet socket APIs are usually based on the Berkeley\nsockets standard.\n\nA 'socket address' is the combination of an IP address and a port number, much\nlike one end of a telephone connection is the combination of a phone number and\na particular extension. Based on this address, internet sockets deliver incoming\ndata packets to the appropriate application process or thread.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Internet_socket","recorded":1362371625,"links":32,"instances":["information_technology","computing","computing","computing","computing","operating_system","computer_science","computer_science","networking_api","computing"],"pdf":["http://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/Publications/PubPDFs/The%20Desktop%20Computer%20as%20a%20Network%20Participant.pdf"],"categories":["Network socket|"],"headings":["Overview","Socket types","Socket states and the client-server model","Socket pairs","Implementations","Sockets in network equipment","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["process","computing"],["thread","computer_science"],["protocol","computing"],["server","computing"],["client","computing"],["session","computer_science"],["streams","networking_api"],["vm","operating_system"],["router","computing"],["packet","information_technology"]],"members":["packet","protocol","router","process","client","vm","thread","session","streams","server"],"related":["Inter-process_communication","Communication_flow","Computer_network","Internet_Protocol","Application_programming_interface","Operating_system","Berkeley_sockets","IP_address","Port_number","Process_(computing)","Thread_(computer_science)","Protocol_(computing)","Transmission_Control_Protocol","User_Datagram_Protocol","Raw_socket","IETF","Request_for_Comments","Internet_Standard","ARPANET","Microsoft_Windows","Netstat","Datagram_socket","Connectionless","User_Datagram_Protocol","Stream_socket","Connection-oriented","Transmission_Control_Protocol","Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol","Raw_socket","Systems_Network_Architecture","Unix_domain_socket","Server_(computing)","Client_(computing)","Virtual_connection","Session_(computer_science)","Byte_stream","Tuple","Connectionless","4-tuple","Application_programming_interface","Berkeley_sockets","Winsock","Streams_(networking_API)","Transport_Layer_Interface","Socket_programming","Computer_network_programming","Berkeley_Software_Distribution","Unix","Operating_system","University_of_California,_Berkeley","AT&T","Berkeley_sockets","Transport_Layer_Interface","Application_Programming_Interface","AT&T","UNIX_System_V","Transport_Layer_Interface","TOPS-20","MVS","VM_(operating_system)","IBM_PC_DOS","Transport_Layer","Internet_Protocol_Suite","Router_(computing)","Network_switch","Link_Layer","Internet_Layer","Network_firewall","Network_address_translator","Fair_queuing","Layer_3_switching","Quality_of_service","Packet_flow","Raw_socket","Routing_protocol","IGRP","OSPF","Internet_Control_Message_Protocol","Internet_protocol_suite","Packet_(information_technology)","List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers"]}
