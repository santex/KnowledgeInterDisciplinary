{"cursor":"12694","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] A 'figure drawing' is a drawing of the human form in any of its various\nshapes and postures using any of the drawing media. The degree of representation\nmay be from highly detailed, anatomically correct renderings to loose and\nexpressive sketches. A \"life drawing\" is a drawing of the human figure from\nobservation of a live model. A figure drawing may be a composed work of art or a\nfigure study done in preparation for a more finished work such as a\npainting. Berry, Ch. 8 - \"Drawing as Preparation\" The term can also\nrefer to the act of producing such a drawing. Figure drawing is arguably the\nmost difficult subject an artist commonly encounters, and entire courses are\ndedicated to the subject. The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in\nthe visual arts, and the human figure can be the basis of portraiture,\nillustration, sculpture, medical illustration, and other fields.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Figure_drawing","recorded":1362371285,"links":21,"instances":["drawing","art","art"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Art genres","Drawing"],"headings":["Approaches","Media","History","Contemporary studio instruction","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Anatomy_of_a_Male_Nude.jpg/220px-Anatomy_of_a_Male_Nude.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/School_of_Rembrandt_-_Sitting_nude.jpg/220px-School_of_Rembrandt_-_Sitting_nude.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Corinth_stehender_M%C3%A4dchenakt.jpg/220px-Corinth_stehender_M%C3%A4dchenakt.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Carracci%2C_Annbale_-_Studio_di_nudo.jpg/240px-Carracci%2C_Annbale_-_Studio_di_nudo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["model","art"],["stump","drawing"],["nude","art"]],"members":["stump","nude","model"],"related":["Human_positions","Model_(art)","Figure_study","Drawing","Artist","Portrait_painting","Sculpture","Medical_illustration","Photography","Skeleton","Muscle","Geometry","Foreshortening","Paris_Salon","Cont√©","Charcoal","Stump_(drawing)","Henri_Matisse","Antoine_Watteau","Baroque","Rococo","Pliny_the_Elder","Zeuxis","Agrigentum","Cennino_Cennini","Villard_de_Honnecourt","The_Carracci","Jacques-Louis_David","Fine_art","Illustration","Nude","Gesture_drawing","Body_proportions","Figure_painting","Sculpture","Nude_(art)","Academy_figure","Depictions_of_nudity","Nude_photography"]}
