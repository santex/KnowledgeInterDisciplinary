Marshall Space Flight Center' ('MSFC') is the U.S. government's\ncivilian rocketry and spacecraft propulsion research center. The largest NASA\ncenter, MSFC's first mission was developing the Saturn launch vehicles for the\nApollo moon program. Marshall has been the agency's lead center for Space\nShuttle propulsion and its external tank; payloads and related crew training;\nInternational Space Station (ISS) design and assembly; and computers, networks,\nand information management. Located on the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville,\nAlabama, MSFC is named in honor of General of the Army George Marshall.\n\nThe center also contains the 'Huntsville Operations Support Center' ('HOSC'), a\nfacility that supports Space Shuttle launch, payload and experiment activities\nat the Kennedy Space Center, ISS launch and experiment operations. The HOSC also\nmonitors rocket launches from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station when a Marshall\nCenter payload is on board.\n","linknr":727,"url":"Marshall_Space_Flight_Center","recorded":1362268010,"links":52,"instances":["spacecraft","rocket_engine","spacecraft","rocket_family","porter_bridwell","rocket_engine","iss_module","iss_module","spacecraft","iss_module","united_states","nasa","rocket_family","apollo","rocket_family","rocket","rocket_engine","spacecraft","united_states_army","spaceflight"],"pdf":["http://nmsua.edu/tiopete/files/2008/12/wspgcoldbook.pdf","http://marshallstar.msfc.nasa.gov/3-3-11.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/163092main_constellation_program_overview.pdf","http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/docs/ISS_overview.pdf","http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/lunar/LRV_Historical_Perspective.pdf"],"categories":["NASA
