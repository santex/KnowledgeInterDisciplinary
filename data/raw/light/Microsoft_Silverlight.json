The run-time environment for Silverlight is available as a plug-in for\nweb browsers running under Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. While early versions\nof Silverlight focused on streaming media, current versions support multimedia,\ngraphics and animation, and give developers support for CLI languages and\ndevelopment tools. Silverlight is also one of the two application development\nplatforms for Windows Phone, but Silverlight enabled web pages cannot run on\nInternet Explorer for Windows Phone as there is no plugin.

It is compatible with multiple web browsers used on Microsoft Windows and\nMac OS X operating systems, and with mobile devices using the Windows Mobile and Symbian (Series 60) http://blogs.msdn.com/b/slsymbian/archive/2010/07/06/announcing-\nsilverlight-for-symbian-rtm.aspx platforms.\n\nA free software implementation named Moonlight, developed by Novell in\ncooperation with Microsoft, was released to bring Silverlight versions 1 and 2\nfunctionality to Linux, FreeBSD and other open source platformsâalthough some\nLinux distributions do not include it, citing redistribution and patent\nconcerns. However, in May 2012, Moonlight was abandoned because of\nits lack of popularity.

profile\nevents, including the NBC coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics in\nBeijing, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and the\n2008 conventions for both major United States political parties.\nSilverlight is also used by Netflix for its instant video
