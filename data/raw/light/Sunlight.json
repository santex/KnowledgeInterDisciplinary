On Earth, sunlight is filtered through the Earth's\natmosphere, and is obvious as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon.\n\nWhen the direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds, it is experienced\nas 'sunshine', a combination of bright light and radiant heat. When it is\nblocked by the clouds or reflects off other objects, it is experienced as\ndiffused light.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization uses the term \"sunshine duration\" to mean\nthe cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the Sun\nof at least 120 watts per square meter.\n\nSunlight may be recorded using a sunshine recorder, pyranometer or\npyrheliometer.\n\nSunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to reach the Earth. On average, it takes\nenergy between 10,000 and 170,000 years to leave the sun's interior and then be\nemitted from the surface as light.\n\nDirect sunlight has a luminous efficacy of about 93 lumens per watt of\nradiant flux. Bright sunlight provides illuminance of approximately 100,000 lux\nor lumens per square meter at the Earth's surface. The total amount of energy\nreceived at ground level from the sun at the zenith is 1004 watts per square\nmeter, which is composed of 527 watts of infrared radiation, 445 watts\nof visible light, and 32 watts of ultraviolet radiation. At the top of the\natmosphere sunlight is about 30% more intense, with more than three times the\nfraction of ultraviolet (UV), with most of the extra UV consisting of biologically-\ndamaging shortwave ultraviolet.
