{"cursor":"20071","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"), as well as two diverging ultraparallel lines.]]\n\n'Differential geometry' is a mathematical discipline that uses the techniques of\ndifferential calculus and integral calculus, as well as linear algebra and\nmultilinear algebra, to study problems in geometry. The theory of plane and\nspace curves and of surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space formed the\nbasis for development of differential geometry during the 18th century and the\n19th century. Since the late 19th century, differential geometry has grown into\na field concerned more generally with the geometric structures on differentiable\nmanifolds. Differential geometry is closely related to differential topology,\nand to the geometric aspects of the theory of differential equations. The\ndifferential geometry of surfaces captures many of the key ideas and techniques\ncharacteristic of this field.\n","linknr":518,"url":"Differential_geometry","recorded":1362477269,"links":60,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","topology"],"pdf":["http://www.math.ucla.edu/~micheli/PUBLICATIONS/micheli_phd.pdf","http://users.loni.ucla.edu/~ajoshi/final_thesis.pdf","http://VirtualMathMuseum.org/Surface/a/bk/curves_surfaces_palais.pdf","http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~yakov/scanlib/hicks.pdf"],"categories":["Differential
