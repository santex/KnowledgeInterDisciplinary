{"cursor":"30913","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, 'projective geometry' is the study of geometric properties that\nare invariant under projective transformations. This means that, compared to\nelementary geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective\nspace, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts. The basic intuitions are\nthat projective space has more points than Euclidean space, in a given\ndimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that move the extra\npoints (called \"points at infinity\") to traditional points, and vice versa.\nProperties meaningful in projective geometry are respected by this new idea of\ntransformation, which is more radical in its effects than expressible by a\ntransformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first\nissue for geometers is what kind of geometric language is adequate to the novel\nsituation? It is not possible to talk about angles in projective geometry as it\nis in Euclidean geometry, because angle is an example of a concept not invariant\nunder projective transformations, as is seen clearly in perspective drawing. One\nsource for projective geometry was indeed the theory of perspective. Another\ndifference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be\nsaid to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into\nprojective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as\nrailway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See projective\nplane for the basics of projective geometry in two dimensions.\n\nWhile the ideas were available earlier, projective geometry was mainly a\ndevelopment of the nineteenth century. A huge body of research made it the most\nrepresentative field of geometry of that time. This was the theory of complex\nprojective space, since the coordinates used (homogeneous coordinates) were\ncomplex numbers. Several major strands of more abstract mathematics (including\ninvariant theory, the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Felix Klein's\nErlangen programme leading to the study of the classical groups) built on\nprojective geometry. It was also a subject with a large number of practitioners\nfor its own sake, under the banner of synthetic geometry. Another field that\nemerged from axiomatic studies of projective geometry is finite geometry.\n\nThe field of projective geometry is itself now divided into many research\nsubfields, two examples of which are projective algebraic geometry (the study of\nprojective varieties) and projective differential geometry (the study of\ndifferential invariants of the projective transformations).\n","linknr":503,"url":"Projective_geometry","recorded":1362552266,"links":43,"instances":["mathematics","geometry","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","drafting","mathematics","geometry","geometry","geometry","projective_geometry","geometry"],"pdf":["http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/projective.pdf"],"categories":["Projective
