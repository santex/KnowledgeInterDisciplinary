{"cursor":"40767","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'intellectual' is a person who primarily uses intelligence in either a\nprofessional or an individual capacity. As a substantive or adjective, it refers\nto the work product of such persons, to the so-called \"life of the mind\"\ngenerally, or to an aspect of something where learning, erudition, and informed\nand critical thinking are the focus, as in \"the intellectual level of the\ndiscourse on the matter was not high\".\n\n, a French-American intellectual.]]\n\nThe intellectual is a specific variety of the intelligent, which unlike the\ngeneral property, is strictly associated with reason and thinking. Many everyday\nroles require the application of intelligence to skills that may have a\npsychomotor component, for example, in the fields of medicine, sport or the\narts, but these do not necessarily involve the practitioner in the \"world of\nideas\". The distinctive quality of the intellectual person is that the mental\nskills, which he or she demonstrates, are not simply intelligent, but even more,\nthey focus on thinking about the abstract, philosophical and esoteric aspects of\nhuman inquiry and the value of their thinking.\n\nTraditionally, the scholarly and the intellectual classes were closely\nidentified; however, while intellectuals need not necessarily be actively\ninvolved in scholarship, they often have an academic background and will\ntypically have an association with a profession.\n\nMore broadly, any work of the mind may be termed intellectual property, whether\nor not its content is \"intellectual\" in the sense covered in this article.\nIntellectuals include not only philosophers, interested in epistemology, but\nalso others in the arts and sciences, plus the humanities, with no boundaries as\nto fields of study.\n","linknr":517,"url":"Man_of_letters","recorded":1362669473,"links":58,"instances":["sociologist","letter","law","intellectual","gathering","writer","politics","writer"],"pdf":["http://mises.org/etexts/hayekintellectuals.pdf","http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ikp3ever10607101.pdf","http://home.uchicago.edu/~rposner/TABLE%20II.pdf"],"categories":["Academia"],"headings":["Terminology
