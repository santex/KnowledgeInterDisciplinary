{"cursor":"3594","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Analog photography' is a commonly used term for photography that uses a\nprogressively changing recording medium, which may be either chemical process\nbased (e.g., photographic film or plate) or electronic (e.g., vidicon or CCD\nsensor). Through common use this term has come to mean anything that is \"not\ndigital\" despite some amount of controversy that the use of film isn't a true\n\"analog\" process. http://photo-utopia.blogspot.com/2007/10/chumps-and-\nclumps.html http://photo-utopia.blogspot.com/2007/10/chumps-and-\nclumps.html\n\nIn a film camera that uses the gelatin-silver process, light falling upon\nphotographic emulsions containing silver halides is recorded as a latent image.\nThe latent image is subjected to photographic processing, which makes it visible\nand insensitive to light.\n\nIn a video camera or digital still camera, the signal is captured with a video\ncamera tube or charge coupled device sensor, which sends the picture to be\nprocessed by the camera's electronics. The signal can be transmitted or recorded\non a storage device for later playback.\n","linknr":343,"url":"Analog_photography","recorded":1362669395,"links":25,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Photography"],"headings":["Popularity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Analog_Photographic_film_-_1980%27s-1990%27s_years.jpg/220px-Analog_Photographic_film_-_1980%27s-1990%27s_years.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Crystal_Clear_device_camera.png/35px-Crystal_Clear_device_camera.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Photography","Chemical_process","Photographic_film","Photographic_plate","Electronics","Video_camera_tube","Charge-coupled_device","Gelatin-silver_process","Photographic_emulsion","Silver_halide","Latent_image","Photographic_processing","Video_camera","Digital_camera","Video_camera_tube","Charge_coupled_device","Urban_Outfitters","Analog_signal","Digitizing","Digital_photography","Digital_versus_film_photography","List_of_photographic_processes","William_J._Mitchell"]}
