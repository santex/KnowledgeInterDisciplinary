The oxidising agent is \"reduced\" by taking electrons onto\nitself and the reactant is \"oxidised\" by having its electrons taken away. Oxygen\nis the prime example of an oxidising agent, but it is only one among many.\n\nIn simple terms: *The oxidising agent is reduced. *The reducing agent is\noxidised. *All atoms in a molecule can be assigned an [[oxidation number]]. This\nnumber changes when an oxidant acts on a substrate. *Redox reactions occur when\n[[oxidation state]]s of the reactants change.\n","linknr":214,"url":"Oxidizing_agent","recorded":1362477465,"links":50,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrochemistry","Oxidising agents|*","Chemical properties"],"headings":["Example of oxidation","Electron acceptor","Dangerous materials definition","Common oxidising agents","Common oxidising agents and their products","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Hazard_O.svg/125px-Hazard_O.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Dangclass5_1.png/125px-Dangclass5_1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_hazard_symbol","Redox","Chemical_reaction","Redox","Iron","Oxygen","Half-reaction","Redox","Fire","Explosive","Chemical_synthesis","Corrosion","Ferrocene","Chemist","Electron_transfer","Permanganate","Chromate","Osmium_tetroxide","Perchlorate","Oxide","Manganate","Potassium_dichromate","Oxygen","Ozone","Hydrogen_peroxide","Peroxide","Fluorine","Chlorine","Halogen","Nitric_acid","Nitrate","Sulfuric_acid","Peroxydisulfuric_acid","Peroxymonosulfuric_acid","Chlorite","Chlorate","Perchlorate","Halogen","Hypochlorite","Bleach","Chromium","Chromic_acid","Pyridinium_chlorochromate","Chromate","Permanganate","KMnO4","Sodium_perborate","Nitrous_oxide","Silver_oxide","Osmium_tetroxide","Tollens'_reagent","2,2'-Dipyridyldisulfide","Oxygen","Ozone","Ozonolysis","Fluorine","Chlorine","Bromine","Iodine","Hypochlorite","Chlorate","Nitric_acid","Nitric_oxide","Nitrogen_dioxide","Chromium_trioxide","Chromate","Dichromate","Permanganate","Manganate","Peroxide","Dye","Organic_oxidation","Redox","Reducing_agent"]}
