{"cursor":"2505","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In economics, game theory, decision theory, and artificial intelligence, a\n'rational agent' is an agent which has clear preferences, models uncertainty via\nexpected values, and always chooses to perform the action with the optimal\nexpected outcome for itself from among all feasible actions. Rational agents are\nalso studied in the fields of cognitive science, ethics, and philosophy,\nincluding the philosophy of practical reason.\n\nA rational agent can be anything that makes decisions, typically a person, firm,\nmachine, or software.\n\nThe action a rational agent takes depends on:\n* the preferences of the agent\n* the agent's information of its environment, which may come from past\n  experiences\n* the actions, duties and obligations available to the agent\n* the estimated or actual benefits and the chances of success of the actions.\n\nIn game theory and classical economics, it is often assumed that the actors,\npeople, and firms are rational. However, the extent that people and firms behave\nrationally is subject to debate. Economists often assume the models of rational\nchoice theory and bounded rationality to formalize and predict the behavior of\nindividuals and firms. Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter-\nintuitive to many people, as in the Traveler's dilemma.\n\nArtificial intelligence has borrowed the term \"rational agents\" from economics\nto describe autonomous programs that are capable of goal directed behavior.\nToday there is a considerable overlap between AI research, game theory and\ndecision theory. Rational agents in AI are closely related to \"intelligent\nagents\", autonomous software programs that display intelligence.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Rational_agent","recorded":1362897114,"links":15,"instances":["mathematics","economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Artificial intelligence","Concepts in ethics","Economics terminology","Game theory","Humans","Reasoning"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["optimization","mathematics"],["agent","economics"]],"members":["optimization","agent"],"related":["Economics","Game_theory","Decision_theory","Artificial_intelligence","Preferences","Uncertainty","Expected_values","Optimization_(mathematics)","Cognitive_science","Ethics","Practical_reason","Game_theory","Economics","Actor","Rational_choice_theory","Bounded_rationality","Traveler's_dilemma","Artificial_intelligence","Intelligent_agent","Trade-off_talking_rational_economic_person","Homo_economicus","Agent_(economics)","Bounded_rationality","Rational_choice_theory","Game_theory","Intelligent_agent","Software_agent"]}
