At the time, Socialist Republic of Montenegro was ruled by the Yugoslav\nCommunist League's (SKJ) Montenegrin branch (SKCG), more specifically the\ntriumvirate of Momir BulatoviÄ, Milo ÄukanoviÄ, and Svetozar MaroviÄ [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-\n7896b6Qpo SKCG campaign for 1990 parliamentary elections in Montenegro - first\nmulty-party elections] who were swept into power the previous year during\nthe so called anti-bureaucratic revolution, an administrative putsch within\nMontenegrin Communist League initiated by Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ and carried out\nwith the great deal of help from the state security apparatus that he controlled\nby this time.\n\nThe first issue of Monitor was printed in Sarajevo in 20,000 copies and then\ndistributed in Montenegro where it sold in symbolic numbers - only couple of\nhundred of copies. Although the magazine listed 76 individuals as its\nfounders (among them politicians Slavko PeroviÄ, Jusuf KalamperoviÄ, Å½arko\nRakÄeviÄ, LjubiÅ¡a StankoviÄ, DragiÅ¡a Burzan, Stevo VuÄiniÄ, etc. [http://dailynewsmn.wordpress.com/2009/12/18/4-\n120/ Miodrag PeroviÄ, dvadeset godina nakon ruÅ¡enja Berlinskog zida: Crna\nGora je zarobljena zemlja koja tek treba da doÅ¾ivi svoju 1989, projektovana\nda bude zemlja posluge oligarha i mafijaÅ¡a, Monitor, December 19,\n2009] ), in actuality only MiÅ¡ko PeroviÄ (editor-in-chief) and Äano\nKoprivica (main financier) had actual influence on magazine's editorial\npolicy. Following the poor sales of first issue, the magazine effectively\nwent bankrupt and was only kept alive by individual donations. The next eight\nissues were also printed in Sarajevo.\n\nSince Koprivica also generously financed Liberal Alliance of Montenegro (LSCG)\nand Social Democratic Party of Montenegro (SDPCG), Monitor was in essence\nanother arm of the same political front. Somewhat similar in tone and political\nstance to other liberal publications at the time in Yugoslavia such as [[Vreme]]\nfrom Belgrade or [[Feral Tribune]] from Split, Monitor was also very critical of\nthe rising nationalism across the country, especially of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ and\nhis regime in SR Serbia. Furthermore, it also frequently criticized the\nMontenegrin communist leadership, considering them to be MiloÅ¡eviÄ's pawns. As\nthe League of Communists of Montenegro transformed into the Democratic Party of\nSocialists of Montenegro (DPS) in July 1991 and the country slid into the civil\nwar, Monitor adopted a strong anti-war stance with pointed criticism of\nMontenegro's involvement and effort in it through the attack on Konavle and the\nSiege of Dubrovnik. Managed out of a family house in Podgorica's Dalmatinska\nStreet, the magazine intensely criticized the ruling party DPS and its leading\nmembers: Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo ÄukanoviÄ, Montenegrin President Momir\nBulatoviÄ as well as the regime's chief ideologue and party's leader at the time\nSvetozar MaroviÄ. Its makeshift offices were even fire bombed during the Siege\nof Dubrovnik. During the same period, and especially following the creation of\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after the 1992 Montenegrin referendum,\nMonitor was a strong supporter and advocate of Montenegrin independence, which\neven more aligned it politically and ideologically with LSCG and SDPCG.\n\nBy spring 1994, Koprivica mostly ended his financial support of Monitor, which\nis when MiÅ¡ko PeroviÄ took over that aspect of running the magazine as well.\nOrganizationally, the magazine was under the umbrella of PeroviÄ's\nMontenegropublic company. Although George Soros already had a prominent part\nin Monitor's financing through the local branch of his newly founded Open\nSociety Institute network, this affiliation became even more pronounced after\nKoprivica left.\n\nIn September 1995, the magazine's place in the Montenegropublic's organizational\nstructure got changed when it was registered within the company as a distinct\nentity whose managing director became Å½eljko IvanoviÄ.
