The first few aban numbers are\n  1 through 999, 1,000,000 through 1,000,999, 2,000,000 through 2,000,999, ...\n  The word \"and\" is not counted.\n* The 'eban numbers' do not contain the letter E. The first few eban numbers are\n  2, 4, 6, 30, 32, 34, 36, 40, 42, 44, 46, 50, 52, 54, 56, 60, 62, 64, 66, 2000,\n  2002, 2004, ... . The sequence was coined in 1990 by Neil Sloane.\n  Coincidentally, all the numbers in the sequence are even.\n* The 'iban numbers' do not contain the letter I. The first few iban numbers are\n  1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 40, ... . Since all\n  -illion numbers contain the letter I, there are exactly 30,275 iban numbers,\n  the largest being 777,777.\n* The 'oban numbers' do not contain the letter O. The first few oban numbers are\n  3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, ... .\n  Since \"thousand\" and all the -illion numbers contain the letter O, there are\n  exactly 454 oban numbers, the largest being 999.\n* The 'uban numbers' do not contain the letter U. The first few uban numbers are\n  1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,\n  25, 26, ....\n","linknr":102,"url":"Ban_number","recorded":1362372579,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Integer sequences"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Recreational_mathematics","Large_number","Googol","Googolplex","A","E","Neil_Sloane","I","O","U"]}
