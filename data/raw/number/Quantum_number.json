Perhaps the most peculiar aspect of quantum mechanics is\nthe quantization of observable quantities, since quantum numbers are discrete\nsets of integers or half-integers. This is distinguished from classical\nmechanics where the values can range continuously. Quantum numbers often\ndescribe specifically the energies of electrons in atoms, but other\npossibilities include angular momentum, spin, etc. Any quantum system can have\none or more quantum numbers; it is thus difficult to list all possible quantum\nnumbers.
