The Dynamic Energy Budget theory delineates\ntwo classes\n* 'Somatic maintenance'. This comprises mainly the turnover of structural mass\n  (mainly proteins) and the maintenance of concentration gradients of\n  metabolites across membranes (e.g., counteracting leakage). This is related to\n  maintenance respiration.\n* 'Maturity maintenance'. This comprises the maintenance of defence systems\n  (such as the immune system), the preparation of the body for reproduction.\n\nThe theory assumes that maturity maintenance costs can be reduced more easily\nduring starvation than somatic maintenance costs. Under extreme starvation\nconditions, somatic maintenance costs are paid from structural mass, which\ncauses shrinking.Some organism manage to switch to the turpor state under\nstarvation conditions, and reduce their maintenance costs.\n","linknr":77,"url":"Maintenance_of_an_organism","recorded":1362667642,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Dynamic_Energy_Budget","Maintenance_respiration","Immune_system","Turpor"]}
