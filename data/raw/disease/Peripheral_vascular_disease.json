PVD can result from atherosclerosis, inflammatory\nprocesses leading to stenosis, an embolism, or thrombus formation. It causes\neither acute or chronic ischemia (lack of blood supply). Often PVD is a term\nused to refer to atherosclerotic blockages found in the lower extremity. , Retrieved on August 9, 2010\n\nPVD also includes a subset of diseases classified as microvascular diseases\nresulting from episodal narrowing of the arteries (Raynaud's phenomenon), or\nwidening thereof (erythromelalgia), i.e. vascular spasms.\n","linknr":460,"url":"Peripheral_vascular_disease","recorded":1362482092,"links":22,"instances":["surgical","medicine","medical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries","Vascular diseases"],"headings":["Classification","Symptoms","Causes","Diagnosis","Treatment","Prognosis","Epidemiology","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Pvd002.jpg/230px-Pvd002.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["acute","medical"],["chronic","medicine"],["bypass","surgical"]],"members":["bypass","chronic","acute"],"related":["Artery","Coronary","Aortic_arch","Brain","Atherosclerosis","Inflammation","Stenosis","Embolism","Thrombus","Acute_(medical)","Chronic_(medicine)","Ischemia","Raynaud's_phenomenon","Erythromelalgia","Ischemia","Claudication","Intermittent_claudication","Rest_pain","Gangrene","Claudication","Atherosclerosis","Diabetes_mellitus","Amputation","Dyslipidemia","Cholesterol","Triglyceride","Hypertension","Obese","Vascular_disease","Myocardial_infarction","Stroke","Homocysteine","Ankle_brachial_pressure_index","Ischemic","False_negatives","Atherosclerosis","Angiogram","Femoral_artery","Radiodensity","X-ray","Stenosis","Atherectomy","Angioplasty","Stent","Computerized_tomography","Aorta","Smoking_cessation","Cardiovascular_disease","Antiplatelet_drug","Aspirin","Clopidogrel","Statins","Cilostazol","Pentoxifylline","Hyperhomocysteinemia","Angioplasty","Artery","Femoral_artery","Atherectomy","Bypass_(surgical)","Saphenous_vein","Gore-Tex","Sympathectomy","Gangrene","Amputation","Septicemia","Arterial_thrombosis","Thrombolysis","Ankle_brachial_pressure_index","Myocardial_infarction","Stroke","Chronic_venous_insufficiency","Vascular_myelopathy","Chronic_cerebrospinal_venous_insufficiency"]}
