{"cursor":"19716","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cohen' (, kÅhÄn, \"priest\") is a Jewish surname of biblical origins\n(see: Kohen). It is a very common Jewish surname, comparable to 'Smith' in an\nEnglish-language context.\n\nBearing the surname indicates that one's patrilineal ancestors were priests in\nthe Temple of Jerusalem. A single such priest was known as a Kohen, and the\nhereditary caste descending from these priests is collectively known as the\nKohanim. Donin, Rabbi Haim Halevy \"To Be A Jew. A Guide to Jewish\nObservance in Contemporary Life\" (Basic Books 1972), p.198\" As multiple\nlanguages were acquired through the Jewish diaspora, the surname acquired\ndozens of variants.\n\nBeing a Kohen imposes some limitations: by Jewish law a Kohen may not marry a\ndivorced woman, and may not marry a proselyte (someone who converted to\nJudaism). Donin p.291 Nor should an observant Kohen come into contact\nwith the dead. Donin p.304\n\nAn effort to trace whether or not people named 'Cohen' actually have a common\ngenetic origin has been undertaken in the specific DNA signature associated with\nthe name known as the Cohen Modal Haplotype. Sources for the genetic studies\nare given in the article Y-chromosomal Aaron.\n\n'Cohen' may refer
