{"cursor":"14115","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'linear order', 'total order', 'simple order', or '(non-\nstrict) ordering' is a binary relation (here denoted by infix 'â¤') on some set\nX. Such a relation is transitive, antisymmetric, and total. A set paired with a\ntotal order is called a 'totally ordered set', a 'linearly ordered set', a\n'simply ordered set', or a 'chain'.\n\nIf X is totally ordered under â¤, then the following statements hold for all a, b\nand c in X:\n\n: a â¤ a for all a (reflexivity); If a â¤ b and b â¤ a then a = b (antisymmetry);\n: If a â¤ b and b â¤ c then a â¤ c (transitivity); a â¤ b or b â¤ a (totality).\n\nAntisymmetry eliminates uncertain cases when both a precedes b and b precedes\na. A relation having the property of \"totality\" means that any pair\nof elements in the set of the relation are comparable under the relation. This\nalso means that the set can be diagrammed as a line of elements, giving it the\nname linear. Totality also implies reflexivity, i.e., a â¤ a.\nTherefore, a total order is also a partial order. The partial order has a weaker\nform of the third condition (it only requires reflexivity, not totality). An\nextension of a given partial order to a total order is called a linear extension\nof that partial order.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"total_order","recorded":1371241585,"links":[],"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","order","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mathematical relations","Order theory","Set theory"],"headings":["Strict total order","Examples","Further concepts","Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets","Related structures","See also","Notes","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["trichotomy","mathematics"],["lattice","order"],["category","mathematics"],["map","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"]],"members":["map","group","lattice","category","trichotomy","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Binary_relation","Infix_notation","Set_(mathematics)","Transitive_relation","Antisymmetric_relation","Total_relation","Reflexive_relation","Antisymmetric_relation","Transitive_relation","Logical_disjunction","Total_relation","Comparability","Partial_order","Partial_order","Reflexive_relation","Linear_extension","Asymmetric_relation","If_and_only_if","Trichotomy_(mathematics)","Strict_weak_order","Tuple","Alphabetical_order","Cardinal_number","Ordinal_number","Well-order","Injective_function","Lexicographical_order","Cartesian_product","Index_set","Countable_set","Isomorphism","Upper_bound","Lower_bound","Connectedness","Ordered_field","Rational_numbers","Subset","Partially_ordered_set","Zorn's_lemma","Integer","Partially_ordered","Subset","Natural_number","Lattice_(order)","If_and_only_if","Distributive_lattice","Counting","Well_order","Order_isomorphic","Ordinal_number","Order_isomorphic","Initial_segment","Order_type","Subcategory","Category_(mathematics)","Partially_ordered_set","Morphism","Bijection","Map_(mathematics)","Isomorphism","Topology","Order_topology","Normal_space","Completely_distributive_lattice","Upper_bound","Least_upper_bound","Real_number","Rational_number","Complete_lattice","Compact_space","Unit_interval","Affinely_extended_real_number_system","Homeomorphism","Scattered_order","Cartesian_product","Lexicographical_order","Product_order","Vector_space","Ordered_vector_space","Partial_order","Group_(mathematics)","Totally_ordered_group","Betweenness_relation","Cyclic_order","Separation_relation","Order_theory","Well-order","Suslin's_problem","Countryman_line"]}
