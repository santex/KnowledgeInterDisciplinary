Of these diseases, those\ncharacterized by structural deformities are termed \"congenital anomalies\" and\ninvolve defects in or damage to a developing fetus.\n\nA congenital disorder may be the result of genetic abnormalities, the\nintrauterine (uterus) environment, errors of morphogenesis, infection, or a\nchromosomal abnormality. The outcome of the disorder will depend on complex\ninteractions between the pre-natal deficit and the post-natal environment.

Animal studies indicate that\nthe mother's (and possibly the father's) diet, vitamin intake, and glucose\nlevels prior to ovulation and conception have long-term effects on fetal growth\nand adolescent and adult disease. Congenital disorders vary widely in\ncausation and abnormalities. Any substance that causes birth defects is known as\na teratogen.\n\nThe older term congenital disorder does not necessarily refer to a\n''genetic'' disorder despite the similarity of the words. Some disorders can be\ndetected before birth through prenatal diagnosis (screening).\n","linknr":521,"url":"Congenital_disorder","recorded":1362563151,"links":42,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Congenital disorders|","Developmental biology"],"headings":["Classification","Causes","Epidemiology","Occurrence rate","Fossil record","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg/16px-Handicapped_Accessible_sign.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Congenital_anomalies_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg/220px-Congenital_anomalies_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2004.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sequence","medicine"]],"members":["sequence"],"related":["Birth","Neonatal","Fetus","Genetics","Uterus","Morphogenesis","Infection","Chromosomal","Prenatal","Postnatal","Vitamin","Glucose","Ovulation","Teratogen","Genetic_disorder","Prenatal_diagnosis","Minor_physical_anomalies","Clinodactyly","Metacarpal","Metatarsal","Sacral_dimple","Birth","Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention","Birth_defects","Cleft_palate","Congenital","Malformation_syndrome","Oligohydramnios","Sequence_(medicine)","Syndrome","Autosome","Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Antibiotics","Fertilisation","Sulfonamides","Nitrofurantoin","Toxins","Folic_acid","Neural_tube","Spina_Bifida","Womb","Twins","Conjoined_twins","Cleft_lip_and_palate","Anencephaly","Spina_bifida","Microcephaly","Esophageal_atresia","Hydrocephalus","Renal_agenesis","Cleft_lip_and_palate","Renal_agenesis","Pyloric_stenosis","Meckel's_diverticulum","Congenital_megacolon","Paleopathologists","Block_vertebra","Choristodere","Polycephaly","Congenital_abnormality","Malformative_syndrome","List_of_congenital_disorders","March_of_Dimes","Mitochondrial_disease"]}
