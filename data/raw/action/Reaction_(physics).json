{"cursor":"11746","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe third of Newton's laws of motion of classical mechanics states that forces\nalways occur in pairs. This is related to the fact that a force results from the\ninteraction of two objects. Every force ('action') on one object is accompanied\nby a 'reaction' on another, of equal magnitude but opposite direction. The\nattribution of which of the two forces is action or reaction is arbitrary. Each\nof the two forces can be considered the action, the other force is its\nassociated reaction.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Reaction_(physics)","recorded":1362374756,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical mechanics","Force"],"headings":["Examples","Misconceptions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Newton's_laws_of_motion","Classical_mechanics","Force","Biomechanics","Ground_reaction_force","Normal_force","Friction","Earth","Sun","Centripetal_force","Mass","Center_of_mass","Gravitational_force","Weight","Tension","Normal_force","Buoyant","Causality","Centripetal_force","Centrifugal_force","Net_force","Fictitious_force","Reactive_centrifugal_force","Hammer_throw","Seismology","Speed_of_sound","Valve_float","Ground_reaction_force","Reactive_centrifugal_force","Isaac_Newton","Ibn_Bajjah","Reaction_engine","Jet_engine"]}
