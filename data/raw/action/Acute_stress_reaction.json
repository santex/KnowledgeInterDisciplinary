It should not be confused with\nthe unrelated circulatory condition of shock, or the concept of shock value.\n\n\"Acute stress response\" was first described by Walter Cannon in the 1920s as a\ntheory that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic\nnervous system. The response was later recognized as the first stage of a\ngeneral adaptation syndrome that regulates stress responses among vertebrates\nand other organisms.\n\nThe onset of a stress response is associated with specific physiological\nactions in the sympathetic nervous system, both directly and indirectly through\nthe release of adrenaline and to a lesser extent noradrenaline from the medulla\nof the adrenal glands. These catecholamine hormones facilitate immediate\nphysical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and breathing,\nconstricting blood vessels. An abundance of catecholamines at neuroreceptor\nsites facilitates reliance on spontaneous or intuitive behaviors often related\nto combat or escape.\n\nNormally, when a person is in a serene, unstimulated state, the \"firing\" of\nneurons in the locus ceruleus is minimal. A novel stimulus, once perceived, is\nrelayed from the sensory cortex of the brain through the thalamus to the brain\nstem. That route of signaling increases the rate of noradrenergic activity in\nthe locus ceruleus, and the person becomes alert and attentive to the\nenvironment.\n\nIf a stimulus is perceived as a threat, a more intense and prolonged discharge\nof the locus ceruleus activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic\nnervous system (Thase & Howland, 1995). The activation of the sympathetic\nnervous system leads to the release of noradrenaline from nerve endings acting\non the heart, blood vessels, respiratory centers, and other sites. The ensuing\nphysiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response. The\nother major player in the acute stress response is the hypothalamic-pituitary-\nadrenal axis.\n","linknr":452,"url":"Acute_stress_reaction","recorded":1362899708,"links":35,"instances":["circulatory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abnormal psychology","Aftermath of war","Stress","Anxiety disorders","Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders","Emotions|Shock","Psychiatric diagnosis"],"headings":["Causes","Symptoms of acute stress reaction","Symptoms of acute stress disorder","Diagnostic guidelines","Treatment","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/90px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["shock","circulatory"]],"members":["shock"],"related":["Psychology","Shock_(circulatory)","Shock_value","Walter_Cannon","Sympathetic_nervous_system","Adrenaline","Noradrenaline","Adrenal_medulla","Adrenal_gland","Hormone","Locus_ceruleus","Sensory_cortex","Thalamus","Brain_stem","Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal_axis","Traumatic_event","Post-Traumatic_Stress_Disorder","Panic_anxiety","Post_Traumatic_Stress_Disorder","Cognitive_restructuring","Combat_stress_reaction","Fight-or-flight_response","Posttraumatic_stress_disorder"]}
