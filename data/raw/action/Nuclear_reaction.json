Protons are\n symbolically represented by red spheres, and neutrons by blue spheres.]] In\n nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, a 'nuclear reaction' is semantically\n considered to be the process in which two nuclei, or else a nucleus of an atom\n and a subatomic particle (such as a proton, neutron, or high energy electron)\n from outside the atom, collide to produce one or more nuclides that are\n different from the nuclide(s) that began the process. Thus, a nuclear reaction\n must cause a transformation of at least one nuclide to another. If a nucleus\n interacts with another nucleus or particle and they then separate without\n changing the nature of any nuclide, the process is simply referred to as a type\n of nuclear scattering, rather than a nuclear reaction.\n\nIn principle, a reaction can involve more than two particles colliding, but\nbecause the probability of three or more nuclei to meet at the same time at the\nsame place is much less than for two nuclei, such an event is exceptionally rare\n(see triple alpha process for an example very close to a three-body nuclear\nreaction). \"Nuclear reaction\" is a term implying an 'induced' change in a\nnuclide, and thus it does not apply to any type of radioactive decay (which by\ndefinition is a spontaneous process).\n\nNatural nuclear reactions occur in the interaction between cosmic rays and\nmatter, and nuclear reactions can be employed artificially to obtain nuclear\nenergy, at an adjustable rate, on demand. Perhaps the most notable nuclear\nreactions are the nuclear chain reactions in fissionable materials that produces\ninduced nuclear fission, and the various nuclear fusion reactions of light\nelements that power the energy production of the Sun and stars. Both of these\ntypes of reactions are employed in nuclear weapons.\n","linknr":361,"url":"Nuclear_reaction","recorded":1362374969,"links":47,"instances":["physics","physics","nuclear_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Nuclear physics|Fission, nuclear","Concepts in physics","Nuclear chemistry","Radioactivity"],"headings":["Notation","History","Energy conservation","Q-value and energy balance","Reaction rates","Neutrons vs ions","Notable types","See also","References","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Li6-D_Reaction.svg/300px-Li6-D_Reaction.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["magic_number","physics"],["q_value","nuclear_science"],["cross_section","physics"]],"members":["cross_section","magic_number","q_value"],"related":["Deuterium","Alpha_particle","Helium-4","Proton","Neutron","Nuclear_physics","Nuclear_chemistry","Atomic_nucleus","Subatomic_particle","Neutron","Energy","Electron","Nuclide","Nuclide","Scattering","Particle","Collision","Triple_alpha_process","Radioactive_decay","Cosmic_ray","Nuclear_chain_reaction","Fissionable","Nuclear_fission","Nuclear_fusion","Nuclear_weapon","Invariant_mass","Mass_number","Lithium-6","Hydrogen-2","Helium","Lithium-6","Hydrogen-2","Helium","Helium","Lithium-6","Hydrogen-2","Helium","Proton","Neutron","Deuteron","Alpha_particle","Helium-4","Beta_particle","Electron","Gamma_photon","Lithium-6","Ernest_Rutherford","John_Cockcroft","Ernest_Walton","Nuclear_fission","Kinetic_energy","Relative_atomic_mass","Atomic_mass_unit","U","Conservation_of_energy","Binding_energy","Mass-energy_equivalence","Atomic_mass_unit","Joule","MeV","MeV","Nucleon","Magic_number_(physics)","Nuclear_orbital","Atomic_orbital","Kinetic_energy","Photon","Gamma_ray","Metastable","Energy_level","Asterisk","Nuclear_decay","X-ray","Electron_shell","Emission_line","Chemical_equation","Lithium-6","Hydrogen-2","Helium","Electron_volt","Q_value_(nuclear_science)","Flux","Cross_section_(physics)","Joint_Institute_for_Nuclear_Astrophysics","Strong_force","Electrostatics","Atom","Electron_cloud","Particle_accelerator","Nuclear_decay","Thermonuclear","Cosmic_ray","Neutron","Thermal_neutron","De_Broglie_wavelength","Resonance","Nuclear_fusion","Spallation","Induced_gamma_emission","Alpha_decay","Ternary_fission","Nuclear_fission","Spontaneous_fission","Elastic_scattering","Light_scattering","Wave_function","Nuclear_shell_model","Alpha_decay","Deuteron","Ion_beam","Strangeness","Kaon","Pion","Hypernucleus","Nuclear_transmutation","Tritium","Lithium-7","Carbon-14","Lithium-6","Boron-10","Helium-3","Nitrogen-14","Neutron","Nuclear_reactor","Nuclear_weapon","Neutron_scattering","Neutron_capture","Nuclear_fission","Odd-odd_nuclei","Thermal_neutron","Fast_neutrons","Protactinium-231","Uranium-232","Thorium_cycle","Actinide","Beryllium","Neutron_reflector","Nuclear_weapon","Tritium","Castle_Bravo","Castle_Romeo","Castle_Yankee","Nuclear_test","Coulomb_barrier","Giant_dipole_resonance","Radiation_shielding","Electron_accelerator","Nuclear_chain_reaction","Oppenheimer-Phillips_process","Atomic_nucleus","Atomic_number","Atomic_mass","Carbon-nitrogen_cycle","Acoplanarity"]}
