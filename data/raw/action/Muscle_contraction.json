{"cursor":"26936","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nMuscle fiber generates tension during the action of actin and myosin cross-\nbridge cycling. While under tension, the muscle may lengthen, shorten, or remain\nthe same. Although the term 'contraction' implies shortening, when referring to\nthe muscular system, it means muscle fibers generating tension with the help of\nmotor neurons (the terms 'twitch tension', 'twitch force', and 'fiber\ncontraction' are also used).\n\nVoluntary muscle contraction is controlled by the central nervous system. The\nbrain sends signals, in the form of action potentials, through the nervous\nsystem to the motor neuron that innervates several muscle fibers. In the case of\nsome reflexes, the signal to contract can originate in the spinal cord through a\nfeedback loop with the grey matter. Involuntary muscles such as the heart or\nsmooth muscles in the gut and vascular system contract as a result of non-\nconscious brain activity or stimuli proceeding in the body to the muscle itself.\n","linknr":438,"url":"Muscle_contraction","recorded":1362569838,"links":44,"instances":["biochemistry","exercise_physiology","neurophysiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Exercise physiology","Muscular system","Skeletal muscle"],"headings":["Contractions, by muscle type","Contractions","Force-length and force-velocity relationships","See also","Additional images","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Skeletal_muscle.jpg/220px-Skeletal_muscle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Sarcomere.svg/220px-Sarcomere.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Muskel-molekulartranslation.png/220px-Muskel-molekulartranslation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Lengthtension.jpg/220px-Lengthtension.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/Muscle_Force_Velocity_relationship.png/300px-Muscle_Force_Velocity_relationship.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_1.png/120px-Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_2.png/120px-Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_3.png/120px-Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_4.png/120px-Querbr%C3%BCckenzyklus_4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["summation","neurophysiology"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["isotonic","exercise_physiology"]],"members":["cofactor","isotonic","summation"],"related":["Muscle_fiber","Actin","Myosin","Muscle","Motor_neuron","Nerve","Grey_matter","Brain","Action_potential","Nervous_system","Motor_neuron","Nerve","Reflexes","Spinal_cord","Heart","Smooth_muscle","Autonomic_nervous_system","Skeletal_muscle","Cardiac_muscle","Smooth_muscle","Gastrointestinal_tract","Striated_muscle","Summation_(neurophysiology)","Skeletal_muscle","Action_potential","Golgi_tendon_organ","Renshaw_cell","Avulsion_fracture","Action_potential","Alpha_motor_neuron","Axon","Neuromuscular_junction","Calcium_channel","Acetylcholine","Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptors","Sodium","Potassium","T-tubule","Depolarization","Dihydropyridine_receptor","Ryanodine_receptor","Troponin_C","Actin","Myofibril","Allosteric_regulation","Tropomyosin","Troponin_T","Adenosine_diphosphate","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","Sarcomere","Adenosine_triphosphate","Rigor_mortis","Active_transport","Tetanic_contractions","Isometric_contraction","Isotonic_(exercise_physiology)","Work_Loop","Smooth_muscle","Sarcolemma","Calmodulin","Myosin_light-chain_kinase","Atomic_mass_unit","Myosin_ATPase","Rho_kinase","Zip_kinase","Protein_Kinase_C","Titin","Twitchin","Weight_training","Muscle","Sliding_filament_mechanism","Tendon","Elbow-joint","Biceps","Arm","Biceps_curl","Triceps_brachii_muscle","Acceleration","Strength_training","Muscular_strength","Biceps_brachii_muscle","Elbow","Shoulder","Triceps_brachii_muscle","Desmin","Titin","Protein","Mechanical_work","Fat","Glucose","Adenosine_triphosphate","Muscle_hypertrophy","Strength_training","Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness","Overtraining","Pitcher","Achilles_tendinitis","Hand","Forearm","Joint","Exercise_physiology","Cramp","Dystonia","Fasciculation","Hypnic_jerk","In_vitro_muscle_testing","Myoclonus","Spasm","Supination","Uterine_contraction","Hill's_muscle_model"]}
