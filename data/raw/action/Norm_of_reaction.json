{"cursor":"5338","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn ecology and genetics, a 'norm of reaction' describes the pattern of\nphenotypic expression of a single genotype across a range of environments. One\nuse of norms of reaction is in describing how different species—especially\nrelated species—respond to varying environments. But differing genotypes\nwithin a single species will also often show differing norms of reaction\nrelative to a particular phenotypic trait and environment variable. For every\ngenotype, phenotypic trait, and environmental variable, a different norm of\nreaction can exist; in other words, an enormous complexity can exist in the\ninterrelationships between genetic and environmental factors in determining\ntraits. The concept was introduced by Richard Woltereck.\n","linknr":162,"url":"Norm_of_reaction","recorded":1362566339,"links":19,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ecology"],"headings":["A monoclonal example","Misunderstanding genetic/environmental interactions","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/Trait-scale-norm.png/313px-Trait-scale-norm.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/17/Trait-scale-linear.png/313px-Trait-scale-linear.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["canalisation","genetics"]],"members":["canalisation"],"related":["Phenotype","Genotype","Richard_Woltereck","Cloning","Allele","Gene","Normal_distribution","IQ","Sexual_orientation","Altruism","Schizophrenia","Nature_versus_nurture","Richard_Lewontin","Steven_Rose","Leon_J._Kamin","Richard_Lewontin","Richard_Levins","Richard_Lewontin","Richard_Lewontin","Canalisation_(genetics)","Differential_susceptibility_hypothesis","Evolutionary_theory_of_sex","Genetic_determinism","Nature_versus_nurture","Phenotypic_plasticity"]}
