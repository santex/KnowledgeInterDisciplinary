It is a part of the\nrules of evidence in many common law jurisdictions. Almost every jurisdiction\nthat recognizes physician-patient privilege not to testify in court, either\nby statute or though case law, limits the privilege to knowledge acquired\nduring the course of providing medical services. In some jurisdictions,\nconversations between a patient and physician may be privileged in both\ncriminal and civil courts.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"physician-patient_privilege","recorded":1363582172,"links":[],"instances":["evidence"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Health law","Privileged communication"],"headings":["Scope","United States","See also"],"image":[],"tags":[["privilege","evidence"]],"members":["privilege"],"related":["Confidentiality","Physician","Evidence","Common_law","Defendant","Age_of_consent","Sexually_transmitted_disease","Statutory_rape","United_States","Federal_Rules_of_Evidence","Texas","Privilege_(evidence)","Attorney–client_privilege","Doctor–patient_relationship","Subpoena_duces_tecum","Subpoena_ad_testificandum"]}
