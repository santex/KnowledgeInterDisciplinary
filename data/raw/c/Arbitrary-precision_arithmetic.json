{"cursor":"27775","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computer science, 'arbitrary-precision arithmetic', also called 'bignum\narithmetic', 'multiple precision arithmetic', or sometimes 'infinite-precision\narithmetic', indicates that calculations are performed on numbers which digits\nof precision are limited only by the available memory of the host system. This\ncontrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in most arithmetic\nlogic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits of\nprecision.\n\nSeveral modern programming languages have built-in support for bignums, and\nothers have libraries available for arbitrary-precision integer and floating-\npoint math. Rather than store values as a fixed number of binary bits related to\nthe size of the processor register, these implementations typically use variable-\nlength arrays of digits.\n\nArbitrary precision is used in applications where the speed of arithmetic is not\na limiting factor, or where precise results with very large numbers are\nrequired. It should not be confused with the symbolic computation provided by\nmany computer algebra systems, which represent numbers by expressions such as\n\\pi \\cdot \\sin(2) , and can thus represent any computable number\nwith infinite precision.\n","linknr":365,"url":"Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic","recorded":1362897536,"links":24,"instances":["computer_programming","mathematics","programming_language","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","computer_program","mathematics_software","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","language","programming_language","programming_language","mathematics_software","programming_language","programming_language","computers","software","data_type","programming_language","arithmetic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer
