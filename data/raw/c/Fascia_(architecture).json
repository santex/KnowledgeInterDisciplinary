{"cursor":"1568","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n or soffit lining can be seen.]]\n\n'Fascia' http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fascia is an\narchitectural term for a frieze or band running horizontally and situated\nvertically under a roof edge, or which forms the outer surface of a cornice,\nvisible to an observer. Typically consisting of wooden boards or sheet metal,\nthe longer dimension is installed horizontally.\n\nThe word fascia derives from Latin \"fascia\" meaning \"band, bandage, ribbon,\nswathe\". The term is also used, although less commonly, for other such band-like\nsurfaces like a wide, flat trim strip around a doorway, different and separate\nfrom the wall surface.\n\nThe horizontal \"fascia board\" which caps the end of rafters outside a building\nmay be used to hold the rain gutter. The finished surface below the fascia and\nrafters is called the soffit or eave.\n\nIn classical architecture, the fascia is the plain, wide band across the bottom\nof the entablature, directly above the columns. The \"guttae\" or drip edge was\nmounted on the fascia in the Doric order, below the triglyph.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Fascia_(architecture)","recorded":1362675938,"links":12,"instances":["liquid"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Walls","Columns and entablature","Architectural elements"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/af/Eaves-lining.jpg/250px-Eaves-lining.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["drop","liquid"]],"members":["drop"],"related":["Soffit","Rafter","Rain_gutter","Soffit","Eave","Classical_architecture","Entablature","Guttae","Drop_(liquid)","Doric_order","Triglyph"]}
