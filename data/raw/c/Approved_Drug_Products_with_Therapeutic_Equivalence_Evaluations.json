{"cursor":"2438","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe Drug, Price and Competition Act (Hatch-Waxman Act) requires FDA to publish\n'Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations', commonly\nknown as the 'Orange Book'.\n\nThe Orange Book identifies drug products approved on the basis of safety and\neffectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act. The publication does not include drugs on the market\napproved only on the basis of safety (covered by the ongoing Drug Efficacy Study\nImplementation [DESI] review [e.g., Donnatal Tablets and Librax Capsules] or pre-\n1938 drugs [e.g., Phenobarbital Tablets]). The main criterion for the inclusion\nof any product is that the product is the subject of an application with an\neffective approval that has not been withdrawn for safety or efficacy reasons.\nInclusion of products on the List is independent of any current regulatory\naction through administrative or judicial means against a drug product.\n\nIn addition, the Orange Book contains therapeutic equivalence\nevaluations—generic drugs—for approved multisource prescription\ndrug products. These evaluations have been prepared to serve as public\ninformation and advice to state health agencies, prescribers, and pharmacists\nto promote public education in the area of drug product selection and to foster\ncontainment of health care costs. Therapeutic equivalence evaluations in this\npublication are not official FDA actions affecting the legal status of products\nunder the Act.\n\nFinally, the Orange Book lists patents that are purported to protect each drug.\nPatent listings and use codes are provided by the drug application owner, and\nthe FDA is obliged to list them. In order for a generic drug manufacturer to win\napproval of a drug under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the generic manufacturer must\ncertify that they will not launch their generic until after the expiration of\nthe Orange Book-listed patent, or that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or\nthat the generic product will not infringe the listed patent.\n","linknr":86,"url":"Approved_Drug_Products_with_Therapeutic_Equivalence_Evaluations","recorded":1362504905,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Food and Drug Administration"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Drug_Price_Competition_and_Patent_Term_Restoration_Act","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Drug","Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act","Drug_Efficacy_Study_Implementation","Donnatal","Librax","Phenobarbital","Efficacy","Prescription_drug","Public_education","Health_care"]}
