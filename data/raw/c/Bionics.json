Steele in 1958, possibly originating\nfrom the technical term bion (pronounced bee-on) (from ), meaning 'unit of\nlife' and the suffix -ic, meaning 'like' or 'in the manner of', hence 'like\nlife'. Some dictionaries, however, explain the word as being formed as a\nportmanteau from 'bio'logy + electro'nics'. It was popularized by the 1970s\ntelevision series [[The Six Million Dollar Man]] and [[The Bionic Woman]],\nwhich were based upon the novel [[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]] by Martin Caidin,\nwhich was influenced by Steele's work, and feature humans given superhuman\npowers by electromechanical implants.\n\nThe transfer of technology between lifeforms and manufactures is, according to\nproponents of bionic technology, desirable because evolutionary pressure\ntypically forces living organisms, including fauna and flora, to become highly\noptimized and efficient. A classical example is the development of dirt- and water-\nrepellent paint (coating) from the observation that the surface of the lotus\nflower plant is practically unsticky for anything (the lotus effect).\n\nThe term \"biomimetic\" is preferred when reference is made to chemical reactions.\nIn that domain, biomimetic chemistry refers to reactions that, in nature,\ninvolve biological macromolecules (for example, enzymes or nucleic acids) whose\nchemistry can be replicated using much smaller molecules in vitro.\n\nExamples of bionics in engineering include the hulls of boats imitating the\nthick skin of dolphins; sonar, radar, and medical ultrasound imaging imitating\nthe echolocation of bats.\n\nIn the field of computer science, the study of bionics has produced artificial\nneurons, artificial neural networks, [http://www.duke.edu/~jme17/Joshua_E._Mendoza-\nElias/Research_Interests.html#Neuroscience_-_Neural_Plasticity_in Research\nInterests].

Retrieved on 2011-04-23. and swarm intelligence.\nEvolutionary computation was also motivated by bionics ideas but it took the\nidea further by simulating evolution in silico and producing well-optimized\nsolutions that had never appeared in nature.\n\nIt is estimated by Julian Vincent, professor of biomimetics at the University of\nBath's department of mechanical engineering Biomimetics group, that \"at present\nthere is only a 12% overlap between biology and technology in terms of the\nmechanisms used\".\n","linknr":415,"url":"Bionics","recorded":1362508901,"links":62,"instances":["behaviour","medicine","anatomy","fruit","chemistry","road"],"pdf":["http://infolib.hua.edu.vn/Fulltext/ChuyenDe2009/CD131/53.pdf","http://infolib.hua.edu.vn/Fulltext/ChuyenDe2009/CD131/53.pdf"],"categories":["Bionics|"],"headings":["History","Methods","Examples","Specific
