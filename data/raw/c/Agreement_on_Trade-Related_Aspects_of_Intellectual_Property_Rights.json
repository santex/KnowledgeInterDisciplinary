For the new microprocessor design, see TRIPS\n:architecture. For the German racing driver, see Wolfgang Graf Berghe von Trips.\n\nThe 'Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights'\n('TRIPS') is an international agreement administered by the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) that sets down minimum standards for many forms of\nintellectual property (IP) regulation as applied to nationals of other WTO\nMembers. See TRIPS Art. 1(3). It was negotiated at the end of the\nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.\n\nThe TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the international\ntrading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive\ninternational agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing\ncountries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow\nreading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the Doha\nDeclaration. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of\nTRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of\nthe goal \"to promote access to medicines for all.\"\n\nSpecifically, TRIPS contains requirements that nations' laws must meet for\ncopyright rights, including the rights of performers, producers of sound\nrecordings and broadcasting organizations; geographical indications, including\nappellations of origin; industrial designs; integrated circuit layout-designs;\npatents; monopolies for the developers of new plant varieties; trademarks; trade\ndress; and undisclosed or confidential information. TRIPS also specifies\nenforcement procedures, remedies, and dispute resolution procedures. Protection\nand enforcement of all intellectual property rights shall meet the objectives to\ncontribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and\ndissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of\ntechnological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic\nwelfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.\n","linknr":547,"url":"Agreement_on_Trade-Related_Aspects_of_Intellectual_Property_Rights","recorded":1362535292,"links":58,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj19n3/cj19n3-9.pdf","http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj19n3/cj19n3-9.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/anrep_e/anrep05_e.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/anrep_e/anrep05_e.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/1391da.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/1391db.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/170abr_e.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news00_e/1234da.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news00_e/1234db.pdf","http://www.worldtradelaw.net/reports/wtopanelsfull/canada-pharmaceuticals(panel)(full).pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/176r_e.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/176abr_e.pdf","http://www.worldtradelaw.net/reports/wtopanelsfull/india-patents(panel)(ec)(full).pdf","http://www.worldtradelaw.net/reports/wtopanelsfull/indonesia-autos(panel)(full).pdf","http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/IPRglobalization.pdf","http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips.pdf"],"categories":["Intellectual
