He was born\non the island of Mohn, which is today known by its Estonian name Muhu, in present-\nday Estonia.\n\nIn 1858, he received his medical doctorate from the University of Dorpat,\nand later was an assistant to Felix Hoppe-Seyler (1825-1895) in Berlin, and\nCarl Ludwig (1816-1895) in Leipzig. In 1869 he succeeded Friedrich Bidder\n(1810-1894) as professor of physiology at Dorpat, where he remained for the\nrest of his life.\n\nSchmidt is remembered for his research involving the process of blood\ncoagulation by demonstrating that the transformation of fibrinogen into fibrin\nwas the result of an enzymatic process. He named the hypothetical enzyme\n\"thrombin\", and he called its precursor \"prothrombin\". Schmidt is\ncredited for providing the foundation for the creation of anti-coagulation\nsystems and the development of blood transfusion.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Alexander_Schmidt_(physiologist)","recorded":1362890699,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["German physiologists","1831 births","1894 deaths","Baltic-German people","University of Tartu faculty","Rectors of the University of Tartu"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Alexander_Schmidt.jpg/220px-Alexander_Schmidt.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/30px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Scientist.svg/30px-Scientist.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Esclapius_stick.svg/8px-Esclapius_stick.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Muhu","Estonia","Tartu","Estonia","Imperial_Russia","Baltic_German","Physiology","University_of_Tartu","Baltic_German","Physiologist","Governorate_of_Livonia","Russian_Empire","Muhu","Estonia","University_of_Dorpat","Felix_Hoppe-Seyler","Berlin","Carl_Ludwig","Leipzig","Friedrich_Bidder","Blood_coagulation","Fibrinogen","Fibrin","Enzyme","Thrombin","Prothrombin","Blood_transfusion"]}
