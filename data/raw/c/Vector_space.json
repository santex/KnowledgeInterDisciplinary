{"cursor":"101616","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'vector space' is a mathematical structure formed by a collection of elements\ncalled 'vectors', which may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by\nnumbers, called [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] in this context. Scalars are\noften taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar\nmultiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The\noperations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain\nrequirements, called [[axiom]]s, listed below. An example of a vector space is\nthat of Euclidean vectors, which may be used to represent physical quantities\nsuch as forces: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third,\nand the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force\nvector. In the same vein, but in a more geometric sense, vectors representing\ndisplacements in the plane or in three-dimensional space also form vector\nspaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like\nobjects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are best thought of as\nabstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases\ncan be visualized as arrows.\n\nVector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well understood from\nthis point of view, since vector spaces are characterized by their dimension,\nwhich, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the\nspace. A vector space may be endowed with additional structure, such as a norm\nor inner product. Such spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, mainly\nin the guise of infinite-dimensional function spaces whose vectors are\nfunctions. Analytical problems call for the ability to decide whether a sequence\nof vectors converges to a given vector. This is accomplished by considering\nvector spaces with additional structure, mostly spaces endowed with a suitable\ntopology, thus allowing the consideration of proximity and continuity issues.\nThese topological vector spaces, in particular Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces,\nhave a richer theory.\n\nHistorically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far\nas 17th century's analytic geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and\nEuclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by\nGiuseppe Peano in the late 19th century, encompasses more general objects than\nEuclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical\ngeometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.\n\nToday, vector spaces are applied throughout mathematics, science and\nengineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with\nsystems of linear equations; offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is\nemployed in image compression routines; or provide an environment that can be\nused for solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore,\nvector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with\ngeometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the\nexamination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector\nspaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in\ngeometry and abstract algebra.\n","linknr":1497,"url":"Vector_space","recorded":1362372643,"links":98,"instances":["geometry","linear_algebra","mathematics","category_theory","mathematics","mathematics","linear_algebra","group","mathematics","topology","mathematics_and_physics","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","linear_algebra","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","field_theory","mathematics","mathematics","topology","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","fiber_bundle","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","algebra","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","signal_processing","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm3/fm3120.pdf","http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm3/fm3120.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/y251407745475773/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/y251407745475773/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Abstract
