He remained a member of the AEU until his\ndeath, stating in the commons in 1931 that \"... I have never\nbeen a paid officer of that union but I have 40 years membership in\nit\". He joined the Independent Labour Party in 1893.\n\nIn July 1923, on the subject of birth control, Broad \"... asked the Minister of\nHealth whether his Department will raise any objection to birth control\ninformation being given at infant welfare centres to married women who desire it\nby voluntary workers attached to the centres, or otherwise to their being\ninformed, on request, where such information can be obtained?\". Mr Chamberlain\nreplied that his \"... view is that such information as is referred to should not\nbe given at infant welfare centres, but that women for whom it appears to be\nneeded on medical grounds should be referred to a private doctor or a\nhospital\". In May 1924, Broad led a delegation of the birth control\nmovement to the then health minister, Clydesdale MP John Wheatley. The delegates\nincluded H G Wells, the Hon. Mrs Bertrand (Dora) Russell, Dr Frances Huxley, and\nothers. Wheatley dodged the issue with the pronouncement\n\"A clear distinction must be drawn between allowing access to knowledge, and\nactually distributing knowledge\".\n\nBroad produced two papers. A memorandum on birth control: presented on 9 May\n1924 to the Workers Birth Control Group, and The\norganised worker: problems of Trade union structure and policy; a report by the\nIndustrial Policy Committee published by the Independent Labour Party (Great\nBritain). Broad was part of the Empire Parliamentary Association 1926\ndelegation to Australia chaired by the Marquis of Salisbury. At the civic reception in the Sydney Millions Club on the\nday of arrival, 17 September 1926, Broad said \"A country like Australia is\ncapable of absorbing a great number of people and the problem must be\nprecipitated in a proper spirit of understanding\".\n\nHe was made a justice of the peace in 1933. Broad\nannounced in 1944 that he did not intend to stand as a parliamentary candidate\nagain saying \"The world is rather cluttered up with older men\".\nHe retired from politics in 1945. He was awarded the\nfreedom of Edmonton in September 1946.\n\nHe was for a time a governor of The Latymer School and a board member of the\nNorth Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton; the same hospital where he died from a\nshort illness on 3 January 1956. Broad House, Fore Street, Edmonton, London, is\na permanent memorial. It was opened in 1954 by Clement Attlee. Broad was survived by his wife since 1900, FreeBMD.
