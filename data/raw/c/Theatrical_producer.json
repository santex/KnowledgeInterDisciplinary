{"cursor":"5433","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'theatrical producer' is a person who oversees all aspects of mounting a\ntheatre production. The producer manages the overall financial and managerial\nfunctions of a production or venue, raises or provides financial backing, and\nhires personnel for creative positions (writer, director, designers, composer,\nchoreographerâand in some cases, performers). Practical Theatre: A Post-16\nApproach, by Sally Mackey\n\nThe independent producer usually initiates the productionâfinding the script and\nstarting the process. The producer finds the director and pursues the primary\ngoals, to balance and coordinate business and financial aspects in the service\nof the creative realization of the playwright's (and producer's) vision. This\nmay include casting, but often only includes casting approval. The producer may\nsecure funds for the production, either through their own company or by bringing\ninvestors into the production in a limited partnership agreement. In this\nbusiness structure, the producer becomes the general partner with unlimited\nliability, and because of this, often brings in other general partners. The\nproducer probably has optioned the play from the playwright, which includes\nrights to future production for film and television. The producer earns the\nright to future ventures because the original theatrical production enhances the\nvalue of an artistic property. This right to further options may be included in\nthe royalty agreement. In other duties, the producer may work with theatrical\nagents, negotiate with unions, find other staff, secure the theatre and\nrehearsal hall, obtain liability and workers' compensation insurance, and post\nbonds with unions.\n\nThe producer handles the business and legal end of employing staff, as in any\nbusiness entity. Hiring creative staff and teams generally involves the\ndirector and playwright's approval. The producer hires the production team,\nincluding the general manager, production manager, house manager, stage\nmanager, etc., at their discretion. In many cases, contracts require that the\nproducer use front of house staff (such as the house manager, box office,\nushers, etc.) and backstage personnel (stage hands, electrician, carpenter,\netc.) supplied by the theatre.\n\nThe producer creates and oversees the budget, sets ticket prices, chooses\nperformance dates and times, and develops a marketing and advertising strategy\nfor the production. Hiring a publicist and marketing team is one of the most\nimportant responsibilities of the producer. These teams are generally in place\nbefore the show is cast.\n\nThe producer collaborates with the director and all staff to plan a production\ntimeline and deadlines for various aspects of the production to ensure a\nsuccessful show opening and run. The producer and director oversee this\ntimeline, with periodic re-assessment and modifications as needed.\n\nThe producer hires accountants, and perhaps already has legal representation.\nThis is important, because of the liability issues mentioned above. All bills,\nincluding payroll, must be paid on time, and taxes must be paid. The producer\noversees the budget. The theatre owner provides box office services and turns\nover net ticket sales revenue. If sales fall under a set minimum level, the\nunprofitable show may close. If ticket sales are good and the show makes a\nprofit, the producer may get 50% of the net profit, the other 50% going to the\ninvestors. Statistically, highly successful shows with big profits are the\nexception. Independent commercial production is a high risk business.\n\nAnother kind of producer is the non-independent, or [[line producer]], who\nfacilitates other people's projects. A repertory or repertoire or festival or\nnon-profit or amateur organization, in most cases, uses a managing director, and\ncreative decisions fall to the artistic director. In theatres with no managing\ndirector, artistic directors often use the title producing artistic director or\nmanaging artistic director, to indicate a higher level of responsibility.\n\nIn the commercial world of Broadway, New York and West End, London and touring,\nboth nationally and internationally, producers are expected to be active members\nof the team, and their names appear above the show title. However, many\n\"producers\" are really investors or the theatre owner, and claim no say in\nrunning the production. A producer credit occasionally applies to people who\nperform special important services, such as finding a theatre or a starâbut\nnormally, the credit for such roles is associate producer. The producer works\nclosely with the production team and cast to make all final decisions. The\nproducer, ultimately, is one of the most important roles in a theatrical\nproduction.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Theatrical_producer","recorded":1363187107,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Theatre","/wiki/Stagecraft","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Theatre_director","/wiki/Option_(films)","/wiki/Playwright","/wiki/Production_management","/wiki/House_management","/wiki/Stage_management","/wiki/Front_of_house","/wiki/Box_office","/wiki/Stagehand","/wiki/Line_producer","/wiki/Facilitator","/wiki/Repertory","/wiki/Repertoire_(theatre)","/wiki/Festival","/wiki/Amateur","/wiki/Managing_director","/wiki/Artistic_director","/wiki/Managing_director","/wiki/Broadway_theatre","/wiki/New_York","/wiki/West_End_theatre","/wiki/London","/wiki/Investment","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&action=edit&section=1","http://www.ibdb.com/","http://www.livebroadway.com/member_links.html","http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/interactive/video/index.html","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&oldid=542567108","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Theatrical_professions","/wiki/Category:Theatrical_management","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Theatrical+producer&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Theatrical+producer","/wiki/Theatrical_producer","/wiki/Talk:Theatrical_producer","#","/wiki/Theatrical_producer","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Theatrical_producer","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Theatrical_producer","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&oldid=542567108","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Theatrical_producer&id=542567108","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Theatrical+producer","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Theatrical+producer&oldid=542567108&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Theatrical_producer&printable=yes","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productor_de_teatro","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produttore_teatrale","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theaterproducent","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Theatrical
