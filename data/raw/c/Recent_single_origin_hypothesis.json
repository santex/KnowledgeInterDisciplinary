The theory is called the (Recent)\nOut-of-Africa model in the popular press, and academically the recent single-\norigin hypothesis (RSOH), Replacement Hypothesis, and Recent African Origin\n(RAO) model. The hypothesis that humans have a single origin (monogenesis) was\npublished in Charles Darwin's [[Descent of Man]] (1871). The concept was speculative until the 1980s, when it\nbecome more accepted due to a study of present-day mitochondrial DNA, combined\nwith evidence based on physical anthropology of archaic specimens.Nevertheless\ny-chromosome haplogroup A00 has provided direct proof against the theory as new\nscience suggests that it is around 300,000 years old (95% 235-500kya) the\nauthors suggest that the lineage is indicative of Homo Rhodeniesis and predates\nHomo Sapiens\n[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929713000736].\n\nGenetic studies and fossil evidence show that archaic ''Homo sapiens'' evolved\nto anatomically modern humans solely in Africa, between 200,000 and 150,000\nyears ago, that members of one branch of\nHomo sapiens left Africa by between 125,000 and 60,000 years ago, and that over\ntime these humans replaced earlier human populations such as Neanderthals and\n[[Homo erectus]]. The date of the earliest\nsuccessful \"out of Africa\" migration (earliest migrants with living descendants)\nhas generally been placed at 60,000 years ago as suggested by genetics, although\nmigration out of the continent may have taken place as early as 125,000 years\nago according to Arabian archaeology finds of tools in the region.\n\nThe recent single origin of modern humans in East Africa is the predominant\nposition held within the scientific community. There are differing theories on whether there\nwas a single exodus or several. A multiple dispersal model involves the Southern\nDispersal theory, [http://www.human-\nevol.cam.ac.uk/Projects/sdispersal/sdispersal.htm Searching for traces of the\nSouthern Dispersal], by Dr. Marta MirazÃ³n Lahr, et al. which has gained\nsupport in recent years from genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence. A\ngrowing number of researchers also suspect that \"long-neglected North Africa\"\nwas the original home of the modern humans who first trekked out of the\ncontinent.\n\nThe major competing hypothesis is the multiregional origin of modern humans,\nwhich envisions a wave of Homo sapiens migrating from Africa and interbreeding\nwith local [[Homo erectus]] populations in multiple regions of the globe. Most\nmultiregionalists still view Africa as a major wellspring of human genetic\ndiversity, but allow a much greater role for hybridization.\n","linknr":949,"url":"Recent_single_origin_hypothesis","recorded":1362373600,"links":50,"instances":["mtdna","australia","mtdna","mtdna","classification_of_human_beings","mtdna","mtdna","biology","mtdna"],"pdf":["http://comm.colorado.edu/~jacksonj/research/coon.pdf","http://comm.colorado.edu/~jacksonj/research/coon.pdf","http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/c_smithpdf/Smith_et_al_Therma_ageJHE03.pdf","http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/c_smithpdf/Smith_et_al_Therma_ageJHE03.pdf","http://anthropology.utoronto.ca/Faculty/Begun/DSA10%20Begun.pdf","http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/Members/Lahr/pubs/AHG-65-01.pdf","http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/Members/Lahr/pubs/AHG-65-01.pdf","http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/human_biology/v075/75.4long.pdf","http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/human_biology/v075/75.4long.pdf"],"categories":["Recent
