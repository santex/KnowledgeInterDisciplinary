{"cursor":"5657","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Electrical resonance' occurs in an electric circuit at a particular\n[[Resonance|resonance frequency]] where the imaginary parts of circuit element\nimpedances or admittances cancel each other. In some circuits this happens when\nthe impedance between the input and output of the circuit is almost zero and the\ntransfer function is close to one.\n\nResonant circuits exhibit ringing and can generate higher voltages and currents\nthan are fed into them. They are widely used in wireless (radio) transmission\nfor both transmission and reception.\n","linknr":153,"url":"Electrical_resonance","recorded":1362485943,"links":25,"instances":["radio","electronics","electronics","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronics","Filter theory","Synthesizers"],"headings":["LC circuits","RLC circuit","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/1/7/017d98c63b5dd607c5195d07a26fbe7e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/RLC_series.png/350px-RLC_series.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["henry","unit"],["tuner","electronics"],["receiver","radio"],["topology","electronics"]],"members":["receiver","tuner","topology","henry"],"related":["Electrical_network","Electrical_impedance","Admittance","Transfer_function","Wireless","Radio","Capacitors","Inductors","Pendulum","Electrical_impedance","Tuned_filter","Frequency","Inductance","Capacitance","Telecommunications","Noise","Distortion","Electrical_reactance","Hertz","Henry_(unit)","Farad","SI_unit","Q_factor","Electrical_circuit","Resistor","Inductor","Capacitor","Electrical_resistance","Inductance","Capacitance","Harmonic_oscillator","Resonance","LC_circuit","Damping","Electronic_oscillator","Tuner_(electronics)","Receiver_(radio)","Television_set","Band-pass_filter","Band-stop_filter","Low-pass_filter","High-pass_filter","Differential_equation","Topology_(electronics)","Antiresonance","Antenna_theory","Cavity_resonator","Electronic_oscillator","Resonance","Electronic_filter","Resonant_energy_transfer"]}
