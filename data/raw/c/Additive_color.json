Red, green, and blue are the additive primary colors normally\nused in additive color system. Additive color is in contrast to subtractive\ncolor, in which colors are created by subtracting (absorbing) parts of the\nspectrum of light present in ordinary white light, by means of colored pigments\nor dyes, such as those in paints, inks, and the three dye layers in typical\ncolor photographs on film.\n\nThe combination of two of the standard three additive primary colors in equal\nproportions produces an additive secondary colorâcyan, magenta or yellowâwhich,\nin the form of dyes or pigments, are the standard primary colors in subtractive\ncolor systems. The subtractive system using primaries that are the secondaries\nof the additive system can be viewed as an alternative approach to reproducing a\nwide range of colors by controlling the relative amounts of red, green, and blue\nlight that reach the eye.\n\nComputer monitors and televisions are the most common examples of additive\ncolor. Examination with a sufficiently powerful magnifying lens will reveal that\neach pixel in CRT, LCD and most other types of color video displays is composed\nof red, green and blue sub-pixels, the light from which combines in various\nproportions to produce all the other colors as well as white and shades of gray.\nThe colored sub-pixels do not overlap on the screen, but when viewed from a\nnormal distance they overlap and blend together on the eye's retina, producing\nthe same result as external superimposition.\n\nAnother example of additive color can be found in the overlapping projected\ncolored lights often used in theatrical lighting for plays, concerts, circus\nshows and night clubs.\n\nThe full gamut of color available in any additive color system is defined by all\nthe possible combinations of all the possible luminosities of each primary color\nin that system. In chromaticity space, the gamut is a plane convex polygon with\ncorners at the primaries. For three primaries, it is a triangle.\n\nResults obtained when mixing additive colors are often counterintuitive for\npeople accustomed to the more everyday subtractive color system of pigments,\ndyes, inks and other substances which present color to the eye by reflection\nrather than emission. For example, in subtractive color systems green is a\ncombination of yellow and blue; in additive color, red + green = yellow and no\nsimple combination will yield green. Additive color is a result of the way the\neye detects color, and is not a property of light. There is a vast difference\nbetween yellow light, with a wavelength of approximately 580 nm, and a\nmixture of red and green light. However, both stimulate our eyes in a similar\nmanner, so we do not detect that difference.
