{"cursor":"14533","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Acoustic resonance' is the tendency of an acoustic system to absorb more energy\nwhen it is forced or driven at a frequency that matches one of its own natural\nfrequencies of vibration (its [[resonance]] frequency) than it does at other\nfrequencies.\n\nThe term 'acoustic resonance' is sometimes used to narrow mechanical resonance\nto the frequency range of human hearing, but since acoustics is defined in\ngeneral terms concerning vibrational waves in matter Kinsler L.E., Frey\nA.R., Coppens A.B., Sanders J.V., \"Fundamentals of Acoustics\", 3rd Edition, ISBN\n978-0-471-02933-5, Wiley, New York, 1982. acoustic resonance can occur at\nfrequencies outside the range of human hearing.\n\nAn acoustically resonant object usually has more than one resonance frequency,\nespecially at harmonics of the strongest resonance. It will easily vibrate at\nthose frequencies, and vibrate less strongly at other frequencies. It will \"pick\nout\" its resonance frequency from a complex excitation, such as an impulse or a\nwideband noise excitation. In effect, it is filtering out all frequencies other\nthan its resonance.\n\nAcoustic resonance is an important consideration for instrument builders, as\nmost acoustic instruments use resonators, such as the strings and body of a\nviolin, the length of tube in a flute, and the shape of a drum membrane.\nAcoustic resonance is also important for hearing. For example, resonance of a\nstiff structural element, called the basilar membrane within the cochlea of the\ninner ear allows hair cells on the membrane to detect sound. (For mammals the\nmembrane by having different resonance on either end so that high frequencies\nare concentrated on one end and low frequencies on the other.)\n\nLike mechanical resonance, acoustic resonance can result in catastrophic failure\nof the vibrator. The classic example of this is breaking a wine glass with sound\nat the precise resonant frequency of the glass; although this is difficult in\npractice.
