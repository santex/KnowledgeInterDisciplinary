Importantly, none of these\nquestions can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nIn British education, the Five Ws are used in Key Stage 3 (age 11â14)\nlessons.\n","linknr":287,"url":"Circumstances_(rhetoric)","recorded":1362574283,"links":26,"instances":["rhetorician","rhetoric"],"pdf":["http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/lesson-plan/Deconstructing-Web-Pages-Lesson-Kit.pdf","http://mediasmarts.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/lesson-plan/Deconstructing-Web-Pages-Lesson-Kit.pdf"],"categories":["Reporting","Research","Problem solving","English phrases","Interrogative words and phrases"],"headings":["History","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Victorinus.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","rhetoric"],["thomas_wilson","rhetorician"]],"members":["thomas_wilson","locus"],"related":["Journalism","News_style","Research","Police","Criminal_procedure","Owen_Spencer-Thomas","Interrogative_word","Yes_and_no","Key_Stage_3","Hermagoras_of_Temnos","Augustine_of_Hippo","Locus_(rhetoric)","Cicero","Thomas_Aquinas","Cicero","Quintilian","Gaius_Marius_Victorinus","Cicero","Julius_Victor","Boethius","Thierry_de_Chartres","John_of_Salisbury","Penance","Sin","Fourth_Lateran_Council","Alexander_de_Stavenby","Thomas_Aquinas","Summa_Theologica","Robert_de_Sorbon","Peter_Quinel","S._Petrus_Coelestinus","Exegesis","Thomas_Wilson_(rhetorician)","William_Cleaver_Wilkinson","Rudyard_Kipling","Just_So_Stories","1902_in_literature"]}
