{"cursor":"4861","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'statistic' (singular) is a single measure of some attribute of a sample\n(e.g., its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function\n(statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are\nknown together as a set of data.\n\nMore formally, statistical theory defines a 'statistic' as a function of a\nsample where the function itself is independent of the sample's distribution;\nthat is, the function can be stated before realization of the data. The term\nstatistic is used both for the function and for the value of the function on a\ngiven sample.\n\nA statistic is distinct from a statistical parameter, which is not computable\nbecause often the population is much too large to examine and measure all its\nitems. However, a statistic, when used to estimate a population parameter, is\ncalled an '[[estimator]]'. For instance, the sample mean is a statistic that\nestimates the population mean, which is a parameter.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Statistic","recorded":1362539073,"links":30,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","statistics","statistics","statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical theory"],"headings":["Examples","Properties","Common misconceptions","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Statistical-Terminology-Why-Does-Nobody-Understand-Me.png/480px-Statistical-Terminology-Why-Does-Nobody-Understand-Me.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sample","statistics"],["function","mathematics"],["moment","mathematics"],["functional","mathematics"],["completeness","statistics"],["sufficiency","statistics"]],"members":["moment","function","functional","sample","sufficiency","completeness"],"related":["Sample_(statistics)","Function_(mathematics)","Algorithm","Data_set","Statistical_parameter","Arithmetic_mean","Data","Population_mean","Sample_mean","Sample_median","Sample_variance","Standard_deviation","Quantile","Median","Quartile","Percentile","Test_statistic","T_statistic","Chi-squared_statistic","F_test","Order_statistic","Moment_(mathematics)","Kurtosis","Skewness","Functional_(mathematics)","Empirical_distribution_function","Random_variable","Statistical_population","Standardized_test","Parameterized_family","Probability_distribution","Completeness_(statistics)","Consistent_estimator","Sufficiency_(statistics)","Estimator_bias","Minimum_mean_square_error","Variance","Robust_statistics","Fisher_information","Statistics","Statistical_theory","Descriptive_statistics","Statistical_hypothesis_testing","Well-behaved_statistic"]}
