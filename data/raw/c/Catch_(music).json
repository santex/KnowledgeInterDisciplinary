{"cursor":"5796","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In music, a 'catch' or 'trick canon' is a type of round - a musical composition\nin which two or more voices (usually at least three) repeatedly sing the same\nmelody or sometimes slightly different melodies, beginning at different times.\nIn a catch, the lines of lyrics interact so that a word or phrase is produced\nthat does not appear if sung by only one voice. This phrase is often innuendo-\nladen, politically subversive, or lewd.\n\n\"Amongst early writers on music, the terms 'round' and 'catch' were synonymous,\nbut at the present day the latter is generally understood to be what Hawkins\n(vol. ii.) defines as that species of round 'wherein, to humour some conceit in\nthe words, the melody is broken, and the sense interrupted in one part, and\ncaught again or supplied by another'.\" Sir George Grove, ed. (1909). Grove's\ndictionary of music and musicians, Volume 4, p.165. The Macmillan company.\n\n\"Catch originally meant simply a round for three or more voices (unaccompanied),\nwritten out at length as one continuous melody, an not in score. The catch was\nfor each succeeding singer to take up or catch his part in time; this was\nevident not only from the manner in which they were printed, but also from the\nsimple and innocent character of the words of the oldest catches, from which it\nwould be impossible to elicit any ingenious cross-reading. But in course of time\na new element was introduced into catches, and words were selected so\nconstructed that it was possible, either by mispronunciation or by the\ninterweaving of the words and phrases given to the different voices, to produce\nthe most ludicrous and comical effects.\" Grove, Sir George (1904). Grove's\nDictionary of Music and Musicians, p.481. Macmillan.\n\nIn the score for a catch the different voices are usually labelled, \"1\", \"2\",\n\"3\", etc. This indicates that voice \"1\" sings its part first. When the part has\nbeen completed it is typically repeated and voice \"2\" joins in and so on. After\nthey have sung to the end of their parts, voice \"3\" joins in. Sometimes there\nmay be variations in the words or music to be sung to each part, the second or\nthird time it is sung. A common mistake in performance is for all parts to\nstart together.\n\nNoted composers of catches were Henry Purcell (A catch upon the viol\n[http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/b/b5/Musikcatch.pdf]), Michael Wise (A\ncatch upon the midnight cats\n[http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/1/1e/CatCatches.pdf]) and John Wall\nCallcott. Callcott's best known catch Sir John Hawkins' History of Music\n[http://wso.williams.edu/cpdl/sheet/call-his.pdf] ridiculed Sir John\nHawkins' work by comparison with a similar work by Charles Burney. An\nexample of a particularly lewd catch is My man John\n[http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/7/70/Eccles_My_Man_John_PML.pdf] by\nJohn Eccles.\n\nOne of the most prolific of modern composers of catches is Donald Sosin, who has\nwritten dozens of them for special occasions and a variety of vocal groups since\nlearning the craft from his composition professor Dennis Riley at Columbia\nUniversity in 1974.\n\nCatches exhibit the property of synergy, whereby the whole is greater than\nthe sum of the parts (and also fairly unpredictable from examination of the\nparts alone).\n\nAn example on the \"University of Michigan Men's Glee Club\": [http://silent-film-\nmusic.com/multimedia/WeTookOffOurUglyClothes.m4a]\n\n:We took off our ugly clothes :And put on our tails again :We combed our hair\n:We're beautiful to look at :We feel immense joy :To be in your city :Of course\nwe'll tell you who we are :We could never forgive the omission.\n\nWhich resolves into the phrase \"Men's Glee Club, University of Michigan\", with\nthe second syllable of immense forming the word men's, the second syllable of\nugly forming the word glee, and the first syllables of the words clothes and\nbeautiful combining with never and city to form the word club and the word\nuniversity, and so on.\n\nAnother well-known example is the \"Liverpool Street Station Song\",\nbeginning, \"The girl that I love has given me the shove \\\\ She says I am too\nlow for her station\".\n\nTwo main composition techniques are used for making the message audible: using\nrests in other parts that don't have a part of the message (for example, in\nUitdenbogerd's \"A Big Laugh\" (2007), one part has \"ha (rest) ha (rest)\" while\nthe other part has \"(rest) don (rest) don\" to make the message component \"hard\non, hard on\"), or using the highest notes at any time to be the message melody\nnotes. Those that rely on the second technique tend to be less obvious in\nperformance unless emphasised. A performance technique used by Uitdenbogerd for\nAustralian Intervarsity Choral Festival revues is to sing the catch in unison,\nthen in parts, then with message words emphasised, and then finally only the\nmessage words. This technique only works for catches that have a message that\nspans the entire phrase. A.L. Uitdenbogerd, \"Sandra's Book of Rounds, Canons\nand Catches\", [http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-an28613508], 2005 This method\nof performance has led to a new innovation in catch-writing, pioneered by M.\nWinikoff, in which a recognisable message melody is embedded within the catch.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Catch_(music)","recorded":1364213118,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Music","/wiki/Round_(music)","/wiki/Innuendo","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Henry_Purcell","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/b/b5/Musikcatch.pdf","/wiki/Michael_Wise","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/1/1e/CatCatches.pdf","/wiki/John_Wall_Callcott","http://wso.williams.edu/cpdl/sheet/call-his.pdf","/wiki/John_Hawkins","/wiki/Charles_Burney","http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/7/70/Eccles_My_Man_John_PML.pdf","/wiki/John_Eccles_(composer)","/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Men%27s_Glee_Club","http://silent-film-music.com/multimedia/WeTookOffOurUglyClothes.m4a","/wiki/Liverpool_Street_Station","/wiki/AICSA","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Dashboard_Confessional","/wiki/The_Swiss_Army_Romance","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-an28613508","/wiki/Template:Counterpoint_%26_polyphony","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Counterpoint_%26_polyphony&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Counterpoint_%26_polyphony&action=edit","/wiki/Counterpoint","/wiki/Polyphony","/wiki/Canon_(music)","/wiki/English_cadence","/wiki/False_relation","/wiki/Fugue","/wiki/Imitation_(music)","/wiki/Ricercar","/wiki/Round_(music)","/wiki/Theme_(music)","/wiki/Part_(music)","/wiki/Voice_leading","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&oldid=544416602","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Polyphonic_form","/wiki/Category:British_music","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_December_2011","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Catch+%28music%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Catch+%28music%29","/wiki/Catch_(music)","/wiki/Talk:Catch_(music)","#","/wiki/Catch_(music)","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Catch_(music)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Catch_(music)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&oldid=544416602","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Catch_%28music%29&id=544416602","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Catch+%28music%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Catch+%28music%29&oldid=544416602&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Catch_(music)&printable=yes","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_(forme_musicale)","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_(musica)","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Catch
