The\nchurch is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established\ncongregations (called [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]] or branches) and built temples\nworldwide. According to the church, it has over 55,000 missionaries worldwide\nand has a membership of over 14.4 million. It is\nranked by the National Council of Churches as the fourth largest Christian\ndenomination in the United\nStates. [http://www.ncccusa.org/news/110210yearbook2011.html 2011 Yearbook\nof American & Canadian Churches], 2011, National Council of Churches. It\nis the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement started by Joseph\nSmith during the period of religious revival known as the Second Great\nAwakening.\n\nAdherents, referred to as Latter-day Saints or, more informally, [[Mormons]],\nview faith in Jesus Christ and his atonement as the central tenet of their\nreligion. Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, sel. Joseph Fielding Smith\n(1976), 121 (\"The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of\nthe Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried,\nand rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things\nwhich pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.\"). Thomas S. Monson,\n\"The Way of the Master\", Ensign, Jan 2003, 2â7. LDS theology includes the\nChristian doctrine of salvation only through Jesus Christ, \"For salvation cometh to none such except it be through\nrepentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Book of Mormon; Mosiah\n3:12 though LDS doctrines regarding the nature of God and the potential of\nmankind differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an\nopen canon which includes four scriptural texts: the Bible (both Old\nand New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the\nPearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon\nconstitutes revelation dictated by Joseph Smith and includes commentary and\nexegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other\nworks believed to be written by ancient prophets.\n\nUnder the doctrine of continuing revelation, Latter-day Saints believe that\nJesus Christ, under the direction of Heavenly Father, leads the church by\nrevealing His will to its president, whom adherents regard as a modern-day\n\"prophet, seer, and revelator\". The current president is Thomas S. Monson.\nIndividual members believe that they can also receive personal revelation from\nGod in conducting their lives. \"Perhaps the puzzle some feel can be\nexplained by the reality that each of us has two different channels to God. We\nhave a channel of governance through our prophet and other leaders. This\nchannel, which has to do with doctrine, ordinances, and commandments, results in\nobedience. We also have a channel of personal testimony, which is direct to God.\nThis has to do with His existence, our relationship to Him, and the truth of His\nrestored gospel. This channel results in knowledge.\" Elder Dallin H. Oaks Of the\nQuorum of the Twelve Apostles, April 2008 LDS General Conference,  The\npresident heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to\nlocal congregations. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead local congregations.\nWorthy male members, after reaching age 12, may be ordained to the priesthood.\nWomen do not hold positions within the priesthood, but do occupy leadership\nroles in church auxiliary organizations.\n\nBoth men and women may serve as missionaries, and the church maintains a large\nmissionary program which proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services\nworldwide. Faithful members adhere to laws regarding sexual purity, health,\nfasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to\nthe church as a tithe. In addition, the church teaches sacred ordinances through\nwhich adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the\nsacrament (holy communion), endowment, and celestial marriage (marriage\nblessings which extend beyond mortality), which are of great significance to\nchurch members.\n","linknr":2058,"url":"The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints","recorded":1362551683,"links":125,"instances":["latter_day_saints","latter_day_saints","latter_day_saints","engineer","lds_church","counseling","lds_church","mormonism","lds_church","lds_church","latter_day_saints","united_states","latter_day_saints","bickertonite","latter_day_saints","mormonism","word","latter_day_saints","lds_church","governor","lds_church","christian_primitivism","lds_church","lds_church","lds_church","lds_church","lds_church","lds_church","1838","organization","lds_church","latter_day_saints","2008","statue","lds_church","lds_church","latter_day_saints","lds_church","latter_day_saints","latter_day_saints","latter_day_saints","latter_day_saints","latter_day_saints","organization"],"pdf":["http://www.lds.org/gospellibrary/materials/gospel/Start%20Here_01.pdf","http://www.lds.org/gospellibrary/materials/gospel/Start%20Here_01.pdf","http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Christian/Mormon/Mormons%20in%20America.pdf","http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Christian/Mormon/Mormons%20in%20America.pdf","http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf","http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Christian
