{"cursor":"28835","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Nucleosynthesis' is the process that creates new atomic nuclei from pre-\nexisting nucleons, primarily protons and neutrons. The first nuclei were formed\nabout three minutes after the Big Bang, through the process called Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis. It was then that hydrogen and helium formed that became the\ncontent of the first stars, and is responsible for the present hydrogen/helium\nratio of the cosmos.\n\nWith the formation of stars, heavier nuclei were created from hydrogen and\nhelium by stellar nucleosynthesis, a process that continues today. Some of these\nelements, particularly those lighter than iron, continue to be delivered to the\ninterstellar medium when low mass stars eject their outer envelope before they\ncollapse to form white dwarfs. The remains of their ejected mass form the\nplantetary nebulae observable through out our galaxy.\n\nSupernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars, is responsible for the\nabundances of elements between magnesium (A=24) and nickel (A=60). Donald\nD. Clayton, Handbook of isotopes in the cosmos, Cambridge University Press\n(Cambridge 2003) Supernova nucleosynthesis is also thought to be\nresponsible for the creation of elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the\nlast few seconds of a type II supernova event. The synthesis of these heavier\nelements absorbs energy (endothermic) as they are created, from the energy\nproduced during the supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created\nfrom the absorption of multiple neutrons in the period of a few seconds\nduring the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest\nelements known, such as the long-lived primordial element radionuclides\nuranium and thorium.\n\nCosmic ray spallation, caused when cosmic rays impact the intersellar medium and\nfragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the lighter nuclei,\nparticularly 3 He, 9 Be and 10,11 B, that are not\ncreated by stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nIn addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances of\nelements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to produce very\nsmall numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides contribute little to\ntheir abundances, but may account for the presence of specific new nuclei. These\nnuclides are produced via radiogenesis (decay) of long-lived, heavy, primordial\nradionuclides such as uranium and thorium. Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on\nEarth also contribute to the presence of rare, short-lived atomic species called\ncosmogenic nuclides.\n","linknr":464,"url":"Nucleosynthesis","recorded":1362512983,"links":43,"instances":["nuclide"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Astrophysics","Nuclear physics","Nucleosynthesis|"],"headings":["Timeline","History of nucleosynthesis theory","Processes","The major types of nucleosynthesis","Empirical evidence","Minor mechanisms and processes","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/NuclearReaction.png/200px-NuclearReaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/SolarSystemAbundances.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Primordial_nucleosynthesis2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/24px-He1523a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["isobar","nuclide"]],"members":["isobar"],"related":["Nucleon","Big_Bang","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Hydrogen","Helium","Stars","White_dwarfs","Planetary_nebula","Supernova_nucleosynthesis","Magnesium","Nickel","Type_II_supernova","Endothermic","Primordial_element","Radionuclide","Cosmic_ray_spallation","Stellar_nucleosynthesis","Radiogenesis","Cosmogenic_nuclide","Quark–gluon_plasma","Big_Bang","Proton","Neutron","Lithium","Beryllium","Boron","Carbon","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Star","Supernova","Primordial_element","Stellar_nucleosynthesis","Supernova_nucleosynthesis","Atomic_number","Carbon","Plutonium","Nuclear_fusion","R-process","S-process","Nuclear_fission","Beta_decay","Hydrogen","Deuterium","Beryllium","Lithium","Boron","Cosmic_ray","Chemical_elements","Arthur_Stanley_Eddington","Hans_Bethe","Fred_Hoyle","William_A._Fowler","Alastair_G._W._Cameron","Donald_D._Clayton","B2FH_paper","Margaret_Burbidge","Geoffrey_Burbidge","Georges_Lemaître","Hans_Suess","Harold_Urey","Donald_D._Clayton","Astrophysical","Nuclear_fusion","Proton-proton_chain","CNO_cycle","Helium_fusion","Carbon_burning_process","Neon_burning_process","Oxygen_burning_process","Silicon_burning_process","Binding_energy","S-process","Supernova","R-process","Rp-process","P-process","Photodisintegration","Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis","Hydrogen-1","Deuterium","Helium-3","Helium-4","Spallation","Big_Bang","Quark","Gluon","Proton","Neutron","Beryllium","Boron","Atomic_nucleus","Stellar_evolution","Stellar_nucleosynthesis","Carbon","Iron","Triple-alpha_process","S-process","Planetary_nebula","Supernova","Technetium","Red_giant","Technetium","Asymptotic_giant_branch","S-process","Isotopes","Cosmic_dust","Presolar_grains","Supernova_nucleosynthesis","Donald_D._Clayton","W._A._Fowler","Alpha_process","B2FH_paper","R-process","Neutron","Rp-process","Proton","Donald_D._Clayton","W._A._Fowler","Isobar_(nuclide)","Spectroscopic_lines","Donald_D._Clayton","Stirling_A._Colgate","Compton_Gamma_Ray_Observatory","Cosmic_dust","Presolar_grains","Cosmic_ray_spallation","Deuterium","Lithium","Beryllium","Boron","Cosmic_rays","Interstellar_medium","Isotope","Technetium","Radioactive_decay","Radiogenic","Daughter_nuclide","Uranium-235","Uranium-238","Thorium-232","Radon","Polonium","Argon-40","Potassium-40","Helium-4","Cluster_decay","Radioactive_decay","Spontaneous_fission","Promethium","Nuclear_reactions","Radioactive_decay","Nucleogenic","Neutron_emission","Neutron_capture","Cosmogenic","Carbon-14","Iodine-129","Stellar_evolution","Supernova_nucleosynthesis","Cosmic_dust","Metallicity","Reviews_of_Modern_Physics","Physical_Review"]}
