Folate. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/folate/NS_patient-\nfolate/DSECTION=synonyms (accessed Nov 15, 2010),additional text. ') are\nforms of the water-soluble vitamin B 9. Folate is composed of the\naromatic pteridine ring linked to para-aminobenzoic acid and one or more\nglutamate residues. Folic acid is itself not biologically active, but its\nbiological importance is due to tetrahydrofolate and other derivatives after its\nconversion to dihydrofolic acid in the liver.\n\nVitamin B 9 (folic acid and folate) is essential for numerous bodily\nfunctions. Humans cannot synthesize folate de novo; therefore, folate has to be\nsupplied through the diet to meet their daily requirments. The human body needs\nfolate to synthesize DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a\ncofactor in certain biological reactions. It is\nespecially important in aiding rapid cell division and growth, such as in\ninfancy and pregnancy. Children and adults both require folic acid to produce\nhealthy red blood cells and prevent anemia.\n\nFolate and folic acid derive their names from the Latin word\n[[Wiktionary:folium|folium]] (which means \"leaf\"). Leafy vegetables are\nprincipal sources of folic acid, although in Western diets fortified cereals and\nbread may be a larger dietary source.\n\nA lack of dietary folates leads to folate deficiency, which is uncommon in\nnormal Western diets. A complete lack of dietary folate takes months before\ndeficiency develops as normal individuals have about\n500â20,000 Âµg Gentili et al, 2009, Folic Acid Deficiency http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/200184-\noverview of folate in body stores.

Folate deficiency and neurological\ndisorders in adults. Medical Hypothesis.volume 2, issue 4 pages 135â140 ,\npregnancy complications, mental confusion, forgetfulness or other cognitive\ndeclines, mental depression, sore or swollen tongue, peptic or mouth ulcers,\nheadaches, heart palpitations, irritability, and behavioral disorders. Low\nlevels of folate can also lead to homocysteine accumulation. DNA synthesis and repair are impaired and this could lead to\ncancer development.\n","linknr":1458,"url":"Folic_acid","recorded":1362509985,"links":97,"instances":["biochemistry","medicine","melon","food","human_embryo","nutrition","politician","biochemistry","medical","biology"],"pdf":["http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/12/11/1271.full.pdf","http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/12/11/1271.full.pdf","http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/eks/Milunsky1989.pdf","http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/eks/Milunsky1989.pdf","http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2008/3/21/den036v1.pdf","http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2008/3/21/den036v1.pdf","http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/14/3/247.pdf","http://www.thorne.com/altmedrev/.fulltext/14/3/247.pdf","http://www.indianpediatrics.net/oct2009/857.pdf","http://www.indianpediatrics.net/oct2009/857.pdf"],"categories":["Dietary
