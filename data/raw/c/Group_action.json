The cyclic group C 3\nconsisting of the rotations by 0Â°, 120Â° and 240Â° acts on the set of the three\nvertices.]] In algebra and geometry, a 'group action' is a description of\nsymmetries of objects using groups. The essential elements of the object are\ndescribed by a set, and the symmetries of the object are described by the\nsymmetry group of this set, which consists of bijective transformations of the\nset. In this case, the group is also called a '[[permutation group]]'\n(especially if the set is or not a vector space) or 'transformation group'\n(especially if the set is a vector space and the group acts like linear\ntransformations of the set).\n\nA group action is an extension to the definition of a symmetry group in which\nevery element of the group \"acts\" like a bijective transformation (or\n\"symmetry\") of some set, without being identified with that transformation. This\nallows for a more comprehensive description of the symmetries of an object, such\nas a polyhedron, by allowing the same group to act on several different sets of\nfeatures, such as the set of vertices, the set of edges and the set of faces of\nthe polyhedron.\n\nIf G is a group and X is a set then a group action may be defined as a group\nhomomorphism h from G to the symmetric group of X. The action assigns a\npermutation of X to each element of the group in such a way that the permutation\nof X assigned to:\n* the identity element of G is the identity transformation of X;\n* a product gh of two elements of G is the composition of the permutations\n  assigned to g and h. Since each element of G is represented as a permutation,\n  a group action is also known as a '''permutation representation'''.\n\nThe abstraction provided by group actions is a powerful one, because it allows\ngeometrical ideas to be applied to more abstract objects. Many objects in\nmathematics have natural group actions defined on them. In particular, groups\ncan act on other groups, or even on themselves. Despite this generality, the\ntheory of group actions contains wide-reaching theorems, such as the orbit\nstabilizer theorem, which can be used to prove deep results in several fields.\n","linknr":330,"url":"Group_action","recorded":1362479196,"links":31,"instances":["geometry","mathematics","mathematics","algebra","mathematics","set_theory","symmetric_group","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","group_theory","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","topology","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Group
