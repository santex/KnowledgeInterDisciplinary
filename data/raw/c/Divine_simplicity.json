{"cursor":"14358","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn theology, the doctrine of 'divine simplicity' says that God is without parts.\nThe general idea of divine simplicity can be stated in this way: the being of\nGod is identical to the \"attributes\" of God. In other words, such\ncharacteristics as omnipresence, goodness, truth, eternity, etc. are identical\nto God's being, not qualities that make up that being, nor abstract entities\ninhering in God as in a substance. Varieties of the doctrine may be found in\nJewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the\nheyday of scholasticism, though the doctrine's origins may be traced back to\nancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' Enneads as the\nSimplex.
