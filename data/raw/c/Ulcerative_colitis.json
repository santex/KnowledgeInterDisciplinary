Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the\ncolon (large intestine), that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores. The\nmain symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood, of\ngradual onset. IBD is often confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a\ntroublesome, but much less serious, condition.\n\nUlcerative colitis has similarities to Crohn's disease, another form of IBD.\nUlcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated\nsymptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom-free. Although the symptoms of\nulcerative colitis can sometimes diminish on their own, the disease usually\nrequires treatment to go into remission. Ulcerative colitis has an incidence of\n1 to 20 cases per 100,000 individuals per year, and a prevalence of 8 to 246 per\n100,000 individuals per year. Danese, S. & Fiocci, C. (2011).\n[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1102942 Ulcerative colitis.] The New\nEngland Journal of Medicine, 365:1713-1725.\n\nThe disease is more prevalent in northern countries of the world, as well as in\nnorthern areas of individual countries or other regions. Rates tend to be higher\nin more affluent countries, which may indicate the increased prevalence is due\nto increased rates of diagnosis. Although ulcerative colitis has no known cause,\nthere is a presumed genetic component to susceptibility. The disease may be\ntriggered in a susceptible person by environmental factors. Although dietary\nmodification may reduce the discomfort of a person with the disease, ulcerative\ncolitis is not thought to be caused by dietary factors.\n\nUlcerative colitis is treated as an autoimmune disease. Treatment is with anti-\ninflammatory drugs, immunosuppression, and biological therapy targeting specific\ncomponents of the immune response. Colectomy (partial or total removal of the\nlarge bowel through surgery) is occasionally necessary if the disease is severe,\ndoesn't respond to treatment, or if significant complications develop. A total\nproctocolectomy (removal of the entirety of the large bowel) can be curative,\nbut it may be associated with complications.\n","linknr":1266,"url":"Ulcerative_colitis","recorded":1362510718,"links":88,"instances":["epidemiology","medicine","medicine","genetics","anatomy","anatomy","nutrition","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/CrohnsDiseaseinAdults.pdf","http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/CrohnsDiseaseinAdults.pdf","http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1323.pdf","http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1323.pdf","http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/9/1425.full.pdf","http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/9/1425.full.pdf","http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/3/397.full.pdf","http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/3/397.full.pdf","http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080406030552/http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate.pdf","http://www.acg.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerativeColitisUpdate.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/q212420164588062/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/q212420164588062/fulltext.pdf","http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1980/Kane_edit.pdf","http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1980/Kane_edit.pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00039.x/pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00039.x/pdf","http://www.cdd.com.au/pdf/paper12.pdf","http://www.cdd.com.au/pdf/paper12.pdf","http://www.cdd.com.au/pdf/paper17.pdf","http://www.cdd.com.au/pdf/paper17.pdf","http://www.em-consulte.com/showarticlefile/100306/index.pdf","http://www.em-consulte.com/showarticlefile/100306/index.pdf","http://gut.bmj.com/content/39/5/690.full.pdf","http://gut.bmj.com/content/39/5/690.full.pdf","http://tropicalhealthsolutions.com/documents/worms/Summers-2005.pdf","http://tropicalhealthsolutions.com/documents/worms/Summers-2005.pdf","http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/307/1/104.full.pdf","http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/307/1/104.full.pdf"],"categories":["Abdominal
