As with previous codes, it takes effect as soon as ratified by the\ncongress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its\nfinal form takes some time to prepare after the congress. Preliminary wording of\nsome of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in\nSeptember 2011.\n\nThe name of the Code is partly capitalized and partly not. The lower-case for\n\"algae, fungi, and plants\" indicates that these terms are not formal names of\nclades, but indicate groups of organisms that were historically known by these\nnames and traditionally studied by botanists, mycologists, and phycologists.\nThis includes blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria); fungi, including chytrids,\noomycetes, and slime moulds; photosynthetic protists and taxonomically related\nnon-photosynthetic groups. There are special provisions in the ICN for some of\nthese groups, as there are for fossils.\n\nThe ICN can only be changed by an International Botanical Congress (IBC), with\nthe International Association for Plant Taxonomy providing the supporting\ninfrastructure. Each new edition supersedes the earlier editions and is\nretroactive back to 1753, except where different starting dates are\nspecified.\n\nFor the naming of cultivated plants there is a separate code, the\n[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]], which gives rules\nand recommendations that supplement the ICN.\n","linknr":270,"url":"International_Code_of_Botanical_Nomenclature","recorded":1362372783,"links":38,"instances":["botany","botany","botany","botany","taxonomy","botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Botanical nomenclature","Classification systems","Nomenclature"],"headings":["Principles","History","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/CarlvonLinne_Garden.jpg/250px-CarlvonLinne_Garden.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Species_plantarum_001.jpg/250px-Species_plantarum_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/1859-Martinique.web.jpg/100px-1859-Martinique.web.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["type","botany"],["conservation","botany"],["correct_name","botany"],["circumscription","taxonomy"],["author_citation","botany"],["correct_name","botany"],["infraspecific_name","botany"]],"members":["infraspecific_name","author_citation","conservation","correct_name","circumscription","type"],"related":["Botanical_name","International_Botanical_Congress","Melbourne","Clade","Botany","Mycology","Phycology","Cyanobacteria","Fungi","Chytrid","Oomycete","Slime_mould","Photosynthesis","Protists","Alpha_taxonomy","Fossil","International_Association_for_Plant_Taxonomy","Nomenclature_codes","Type_(botany)","Herbarium","Botanical_nomenclature","Carolus_Linnaeus","Conservation_(botany)","Taxon","Correct_name_(botany)","Circumscription_(taxonomy)","Taxonomic_rank","Identifier","Paris","Vienna","One_fungus,_one_name","MycoBank","Author_citation_(botany)","Botanical_name","Botanical_nomenclature","International_Association_for_Plant_Taxonomy","International_Code_of_Nomenclature_for_Cultivated_Plants","International_Plant_Names_Index","Correct_name_(botany)","Infraspecific_name_(botany)","Binomial_nomenclature","Hybrid_name","Nomenclature_codes","Scientific_classification"]}
