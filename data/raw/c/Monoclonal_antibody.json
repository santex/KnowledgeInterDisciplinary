Monoclonal antibodies have monovalent affinity,\nin that they bind to the same epitope.\n\nGiven almost any substance, it is possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that\nspecifically bind to that substance; they can then serve to detect or purify\nthat substance. This has become an important tool in biochemistry, molecular\nbiology and medicine. When used as medications, the non-proprietary drug name\nends in -mab (see \"Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies\").\n","linknr":1008,"url":"Monoclonal_antibody","recorded":1362504366,"links":58,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunology","Biotechnology","Immune
