Everything outside the system is\nknown as the environment, which in analysis is ignored except for its effects on\nthe system. The cut between system and the world is a free choice, generally\nmade to simplify the analysis as much as possible. An isolated system is one\nwhich has negligible interaction with its environment.\n\nOften a system in this sense is chosen to correspond to the more usual meaning\nof system, such as a particular machine. But physical systems are often more\nesoteric: an atom, the water in a lake, or indeed the water in the left-hand\nhalf of a lake can all be considered as physical systems. In the study of\nquantum decoherence the \"system\" may refer to the macroscopic properties of an\nobject (e.g. the position of a pendulum bob), while the relevant \"environment\"\nmay be the internal degrees of freedom, described classically by the pendulum's\nthermal vibrations.\n","linknr":220,"url":"Physical_system","recorded":1362476968,"links":31,"instances":["systems","systems_theory","physics_and_chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in physics|System","Physical systems|"],"headings":["Complexity in physical systems","The closed systems of concepts in physics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Physical_systems.gif/175px-Physical_systems.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["environment","systems"],["degrees_of_freedom","physics_and_chemistry"],["open_system","systems_theory"]],"members":["environment","open_system","degrees_of_freedom"],"related":["Physics","Universe","Environment_(systems)","Isolated_system","Negligible","System","Quantum_decoherence","Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)","Complexity","Probability","State_vector","Newtonian_mechanics","Entropy","Mathematical_systems","Turing_machine","Algorithmic_information_theory","Werner_Heisenberg","Closed_system","Hendrik_Lorentz","Einstein","Hermann_Minkowski","Quantum_mechanics","Open_system_(systems_theory)","Conceptual_system","Phase_space","Physical_phenomenon","Thermodynamic_system","Physical_ontology"]}
