{"cursor":"1922","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In medicine, a 'contraindication' is a condition or factor that serves as a\nreason to withhold a certain medical treatment.\n\nSome contraindications are absolute, meaning that there are no reasonable\ncircumstances for undertaking a course of action. For example, children and\nteenagers with viral infections should not be given aspirin because of the risk\nof Reye's syndrome, and a person with an anaphylactic food allergy\nshould never eat the food to which they are allergic. Similarly, a person with\nhemochromatosis should not be administered iron preparations.\n\nOther contraindications are relative, meaning that the patient is at higher risk\nof complications, but these risks may be outweighed by other considerations or\nmitigated by other measures. For example, a pregnant woman should normally avoid\ngetting X-rays, but the risk may be outweighed by the benefit of diagnosing (and\nthen treating) a serious condition such as tuberculosis. Relative\ncontraindications may also be referred to as cautions, such as in the British\nNational Formulary.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Contraindication","recorded":1362582369,"links":28,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical terminology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/AdhesiveBandage.png/40px-AdhesiveBandage.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["indication","medicine"]],"members":["indication"],"related":["Medicine","Aspirin","Reye's_syndrome","Anaphylaxis","Food_allergy","Hemochromatosis","X-ray","Tuberculosis","British_National_Formulary","Classification_of_Pharmaco-Therapeutic_Referrals","Drug_reaction_testing","Indication_(medicine)"]}
