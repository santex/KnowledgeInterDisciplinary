This includes non-native labeled as 'exotic pest plants' and\n'invasive exotics' growing in native plant communities. Exotic Pest Plant\nCouncil. '[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic\nPest Plants of Greatest Ecological Concern in California]' accessed\n4/10/2010. It has been used in this sense by government\norganizations (September 21, 2006).\n[http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/whatis.shtml National Invasive Species\nInformation Center - What is an Invasive Species?]. United States Department\nof Agriculture: National Agriculture Library. Retrieved on September 1,\n2007. USA (1999). Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999:\nInvasive Species. Federal Register 64(25), 6183-6186. as well as\nconservation groups such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature\n(IUCN) and the California Native Plant Society. The\nEuropean Union defines \"Invasive Alien Species\" as those that are, firstly,\noutside their natural distribution area, and secondly, threaten biological\ndiversity. It is also used by land managers, botanists,\nresearchers, horticulturalists, conservationists, and the public for noxious\nweeds. [http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic\nPest Plant Council]. p. 1. accessed 4/10/2010. The kudzu vine (Pueraria\nlobata), Andean Pampas grass (Cortaderia jubata), and yellow starthistle\n(Centaurea solstitialis) are examples.\n\n*The second definition includes the first, but broadens the boundaries to\ninclude indigenous or native species, with the non-native ones, that disrupt\nby a dominant colonization of a particular habitat or wildlands area from\nloss of natural controls (i.e.: predators or herbivores). Deer are an\nexample, considered to be overpopulating their native zones and adjacent\nsuburban gardens, by some in the Northeastern and Pacific Coast regions of\nthe United States.\n\n*The third definition identifies invasive species as a widespread nonindigenous\nspecies. This one can be too broad, as not every\nnonindigenous or \"introduced\" species has an adverse effect on a nonindigenous\nenvironment. A nonadverse example is the common goldfish ([[Carassius\nauratus]]), though common outside its native range globally, it is rarely in\nharmful densities to a native habitat.\n\nBecause of the variability of its definition, and because definitions are often\nfrom a socioeconomic perspective, the phrase invasive species is often\ncriticized as an imprecise term for the scientific field of ecology. This article concerns the first two definitions; for the third,\nsee Introduced species.\n","linknr":1140,"url":"Invasive_species","recorded":1362373135,"links":85,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","biology","biology","chemistry","fire_control","spatial"],"pdf":["http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf","http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf","http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/docs/1_EN_resume_impact_assesment_part1_v3.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/invasivealien/docs/1_EN_resume_impact_assesment_part1_v3.pdf","http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf","http://www.wsg.washington.edu/mas/pdfs/leastwanted.pdf","http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.354.aspx.pdf","http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.354.aspx.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20040102175403/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/AFT/01-114.pdf","http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf","http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental
