{"cursor":"34789","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" cipher machine]]\n\n'Cryptanalysis' (from the Greek kryptÃ³s, \"hidden\", and analÃ½ein, \"to loosen\" or\n\"to untie\") is the art and science of analyzing information systems in order to\nstudy the hidden aspects of the systems. Cryptanalysis is used to\nbreach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of\nencrypted messages, even if the cryptographic key is unknown.\n\nIn addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis\nalso includes the study of side-channel attacks that do not target weaknesses in\nthe cryptographic algorithms themselves, but instead exploit weaknesses in their\nimplementation.\n\nEven though the goal has been the same, the methods and techniques of\ncryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography,\nadapting to increasing cryptographic complexity, ranging from the pen-and-paper\nmethods of the past, through machines like Bombes and Colossus computers at\nBletchley Park in World War II, to the mathematically advanced computerized\nschemes of the present. Methods for breaking modern cryptosystems often involve\nsolving carefully constructed problems in pure mathematics, the best-known being\ninteger factorization.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"cryptanalysis","recorded":1371065249,"links":[],"instances":["cryptography","cryptography","cipher_machine","cryptography","orthography","writer","cryptography","cipher","book","cryptography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cryptographic
