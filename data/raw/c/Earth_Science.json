It is arguably a special case in planetary science,\n the Earth being the only known life-bearing planet. There are both\n reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline\n of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans\n and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically, Earth scientists will\n use tools from physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to\n build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it\n evolved to its current state.\n","linknr":673,"url":"Earth_Science","recorded":1362267989,"links":117,"instances":["planet","science","island","geology","soil_study","geology"],"pdf":["http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf","http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/~pauld/etc/210BPaper.pdf"],"categories":["Physical
