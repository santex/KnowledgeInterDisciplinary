Similarly, a formal\nalliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another's sphere\nof influence.\n\nIn more extreme cases, a country within the \"sphere of influence\" of another may\nbecome a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or de\nfacto colony. The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations\nintervene in the affairs of others continues to the present day. It is often\nanalyzed in terms of superpowers, great powers, and/or middle powers.\n\nFor example, during the height of its existence in World War II, the Japanese\nEmpire had quite a large sphere of influence. The Japanese government directly\ngoverned events in Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and parts of China. The \"Greater East\nAsia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" could thus be quite easily drawn on a map of the\nPacific Ocean as a large \"bubble\" surrounding the islands of Japan and the Asian\nand Pacific nations it controlled.\n\nSometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of\ninfluence. In the colonial era the buffer states of Iran and Thailand, lying\nbetween the empires of Britain/Russia and Britain/France respectively, were\ndivided between the spheres of influence of the imperial powers. Likewise, after\nWorld War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, which later\nconsolidated into West Germany and East Germany, the former a member of NATO and\nthe latter a member of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe term is also used to describe non-political situations, e.g. a shopping mall\nis said to have a sphere of influence which designates the geographical area\nwhere it dominates the retail trade.\n","linknr":345,"url":"Sphere_of_influence","recorded":1362481822,"links":41,"instances":["international"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Political science theories","International relations theory","Sociological terminology"],"headings":["Historical remnants","Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact","Cold War","United States","Russian Federation","Other examples","Corporations","Geography","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Monroe_doctrine.jpg/220px-Monroe_doctrine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Great_Game_cartoon_from_1878.jpg/220px-Great_Game_cartoon_from_1878.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","international"]],"members":["power"],"related":["Latin_America","Monroe_Doctrine","International_relations","Soft_power","Satellite_state","Colony","Superpower","Great_power","Middle_power","World_War_II","Japanese_Empire","Korea","Vietnam","Taiwan","China","Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere","Pacific_Ocean","Japan","Asia","Buffer_state","Iran","Thailand","United_Kingdom","Russia","France","Power_(international)","World_War_II","Germany","West_Germany","East_Germany","Warsaw_Pact","Shopping_mall","Retail_trade","Anglosphere","Arab_World","Eurosphere","Francophonie","Fran√ßafrique","Germanic_languages","Greater_India","Latin_Europe","Latin_America","Sinosphere","Slavisphere","Molotov-Ribbentrop_pact","Northern_Europe","Eastern_Europe","Nazi","Soviet_Union","Finland","Estonia","Latvia","Poland","Narev","Vistula","San_River","Lithuania","East_Prussia","Bessarabia","Romania","Moldavian_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic","Moldovan_SSR","Operation_Barbarossa","Cold_War","Baltic_states","Central_Europe","Eastern_Europe","Cuba","Laos","Vietnam","North_Korea","Sino-Soviet_split","People's_Republic_of_China","Soviet_sphere_of_influence","Western_Europe","Oceania","Japan","South_Korea","United_States","Suez_Crisis","Israel","Suez_Canal","North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organisation","Russian_Federation","Caucasus","Central_Asia","United_Kingdom","Russia","Central_Asia","The_Great_Game","The_New_Great_Game","Geostrategy_in_Central_Asia","Microsoft","Operating_system","Average","Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy","Radius","Central_place_theory","Geopolitics","National_interest","Balance_of_power_in_international_relations","Eurosphere","Lateral_Pressure_Theory"]}
