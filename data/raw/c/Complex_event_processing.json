'Complex event processing', or CEP, is\nevent processing that combines data from multiple sources to infer\nevents or patterns that suggest more complicated circumstances. The goal of\ncomplex event processing is to identify meaningful events (such as opportunities\nor threats) and respond to them as quickly as possible.\n\nThese events may be happening across the various layers of an organization as\nsales leads, orders or customer service calls. Or, they may be news\nitems, text messages, social media posts, stock market feeds, traffic\nreports, weather reports, or other kinds of data. An\nevent may also be defined as a \"change of state,\" when a measurement exceeds a\npredefined threshold of time, temperature, or other value. Analysts suggest that\nCEP will give organizations a new way to analyze patterns in real-time, and help\nthe business side communicate better with IT and service departments.\n\nThe vast amount of information available about events is sometimes referred to\nas the event cloud.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Complex_event_processing","recorded":1362570787,"links":18,"instances":["trading","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p634-wang.pdf","http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p634-wang.pdf","http://home.dei.polimi.it/margara/papers/survey.pdf"],"categories":["Information systems","Cognition","Events (computing)","Process (computing)"],"headings":["Conceptual description","Related concepts","Example","Types","Integration with business process management","In financial services","Integration with time series databases","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["order_book","trading"],["esper","disambiguation"]],"members":["order_book","esper"],"related":["Abstraction","Algorithmic_trading","Credit_card_fraud","Business_activity_monitoring","Security_monitoring","Operational_Intelligence","Network_management","Systems_management","Application_management","Service_management","Event_correlation","Inference_engine","Rule-based_system","Artificial_intelligence","Pound_per_square_inch","Algorithmic_trading","Financial_risk_management","Order_book_(trading)","Market_liquidity","Quantitative_investing","Time_series_database","Esper_(disambiguation)","Event_correlation","Event-driven_architecture","Staged_event-driven_architecture","Event_Processing_Technical_Society","Event_stream_processing","MarkLogic","Nastel","OpenPDC","Operational_intelligence","Pattern_matching","Progress_Software","Real-time_computing","Real_time_enterprise","Streambase","Sybase","WebSphere_Business_Events"]}
