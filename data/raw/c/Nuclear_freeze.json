There have been many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests. On\nJune 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park\nagainst nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the\nlargest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American\nhistory. Jonathan Schell.

[http://www.icanw.org/1982 1982 - a million people march in New\nYork City]\n\nProponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of\nnuclear war occurring, especially accidentally. Critics of nuclear disarmament\nsay that it would undermine deterrence, and if nuclear weapons were completely\neliminated, it would destroy the current Nuclear peace the world is experiencing\nand would make the large Conventional wars, common before the Nuclear age, far\nmore likely.\n","linknr":734,"url":"Nuclear_freeze","recorded":1362893059,"links":47,"instances":["2010","geology","activist","nuclear_test","people"],"pdf":["http://research.unlv.edu/innovation/issues/summer2005/pdf/nuclearpast.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/134/3491/1669.pdf","http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/134/3491/1669.pdf","http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/ESCCONTROLCHAPTER1.pdf","http://www.ifri.org/downloads/Walker_Obama_nuclear_disarmament.pdf","http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/037qk4866n431045/fulltext.pdf","http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/f64x2k3716wq9613/fulltext.pdf","http://ir.lib.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/metadb/up/kiyo/hps/24/hps_24_105.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear
