The process is named after Vulcan, Roman god of\nfire. Hard vulcanized rubber is sometimes sold under the brand names ebonite or\nvulcanite, and is used to make hard articles such as bowling balls and saxophone\nmouth pieces.\n","linknr":256,"url":"Vulcanization","recorded":1362481585,"links":56,"instances":["inventor","mass","mythology","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://cepac.cheme.cmu.edu/pasi2008/slides/venkat/library/reading/RCT-ReviewPublishedPaper.pdf","http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Apr1997/pdf/Apr1997p55-59.pdf","http://www.permatex.com/documents/msds/01_USA-English/81160.pdf","http://www.permatex.com/documents/msds/01_USA-English/81160.pdf"],"categories":["American inventions","Chemical processes","Rubber","1837 introductions"],"headings":["Natural vs vulcanized rubber","Process","History of vulcanization of rubber","Recycling and devulcanization","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Roller-hockey-%28Quad%29-Ball.jpg/200px-Roller-hockey-%28Quad%29-Ball.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Vulcanization_of_POLYIsoprene_V.2.png/320px-Vulcanization_of_POLYIsoprene_V.2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/VulcCurve.png/200px-VulcCurve.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Silicone_rubber_keypad_example_1.jpg/225px-Silicone_rubber_keypad_example_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Charles_Goodyear.png/170px-Charles_Goodyear.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vulcan","mythology"],["elasticity","physics"],["accelerator","chemistry"],["thomas_hancock","inventor"],["pound","mass"]],"members":["thomas_hancock","pound","vulcan","elasticity","accelerator"],"related":["Chemical_process","Rubber","Polymer","Sulfur","Crosslink","Vulcan_(mythology)","Fire","Ebonite","Bowling_ball","Saxophone","Natural_rubber","Elasticity_(physics)","Thermoset","Thermoplastic","Cross-link","Organic_peroxide","Polyisoprene","Styrene-butadiene","Allyl","Accelerator_(chemistry)","Zinc_oxide","Stearic_acid","Catalyst","Neoprene","Polychloroprene","Accelerator","Accelerant","Ethylene_thiourea","Room-temperature_vulcanization","Room_temperature_vulcanization","Room-temperature_vulcanisation","Room_temperature_vulcanisation","Silicone","Acetic_acid","Prehistory","Olmec","Aztec","Mesoamerica","Olmecs","Latex","Rubber_tree","Mackintosh","Charles_Goodyear","Thomas_Hancock_(inventor)","Invention","Autobiography","Grammatical_person","Factory","Woburn,_Massachusetts","Industry","Leather","Friction","George_Oenslager","Aniline","Thiocarbanilide","Energy_conservation","North_America","Pound_(mass)","Ton","Tire","European_Union","Eastern_Europe","Latin_America","Japan","Middle_East","Steel","Fiber","Oil"]}
