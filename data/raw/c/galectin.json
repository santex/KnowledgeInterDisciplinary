The family is defined by having\nat least one characteristic carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) with an\naffinity for beta-galactosides and sharing certain sequence elements. Members of\nthe galectin family are found in mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, nematodes,\nsponges, and some fungi. Galectins are known to carry out intra- and\nextracellular functions, including inhibition of chronic inflammations, GVHD,\nand allergic reactions, through glycoconjugate-mediated recogntion. From the\ncytosol they may be secreted by non-classical pathways, but they may also be\ntargeted to the nucleus or specific sub-cytosolic sites. Within the same peptide\nchain some galectins have a CRD with only a few additional amino acids, whereas\nothers have two CRDs joined by a link peptide, and one (galectin-3) has one CRD\njoined to a different type of domain.\n\nGenes encoding galectin include:\n\n*  (see also Galectin-1)\n*\n*  (see also LGALS3 or Galectin-3)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  (see also Galectin-8)\n*\n*\n*\n","linknr":211,"url":"galectin","recorded":1362513100,"links":15,"instances":["biology","receptor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein domains","Lectins"],"headings":["Structure","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/PDB_1hlc_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1hlc_EBI.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sequence","biology"],["rage","receptor"]],"members":["sequence","rage"],"related":["Protein_family","Lectins","Beta-galactoside","Carbohydrate","Sequence_(biology)","Mammals","Birds","Amphibians","Fish","Nematodes","Sponges","Fungus","Intracellular","Extracellular","GVHD","Glycoconjugate","Cytosol","Secreted","Cell_nucleus","Peptide","Galectin-1","LGALS3","Galectin-3","Galectin-8","Beta-sandwich","Amino_acid","Beta_sheet","Carbohydrate","Tetrasaccharide","RAGE_(receptor)"]}
