Dick explored sociological, political and metaphysical\nthemes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian\ngovernments, and altered states. In his later works Dick's thematic focus\nstrongly reflected his personal interest in metaphysics and theology. He often\ndrew upon his own life experiences in addressing the nature of drug abuse,\nparanoia, schizophrenia, and transcendental experiences in novels such as [[A\nScanner Darkly]] and [[VALIS]].\n\nThe novel [[The Man in the High Castle]] bridged the genres of alternate history\nand science fiction, earning Dick a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1963. [[Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said]], a novel about a celebrity\nwho awakens in a parallel universe where he is unknown, won the John W. Campbell\nMemorial Award for best novel in 1975. {{Cite web| url =\nhttp://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1975\n| title = 1975 Award Winners & Nominees| work=Worlds Without End|\n| accessdate=June 26, 2009\n}} \"I want to write about people I love, and put them into a fictional\nworld spun out of my own mind, not the world we actually have, because the world\nwe actually have does not meet my standards,\" Dick wrote of these stories. \"In\nmy writing I even question the universe; I wonder out loud if it is real, and I\nwonder out loud if all of us are real.\" {{Cite web |last = Bernstein| first\n= Richard| title = The Electric Dreams of Philip K.
