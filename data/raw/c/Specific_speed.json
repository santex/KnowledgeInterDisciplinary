One of the most valued uses of specific speed is the application of\nthis parameter to pumps to define the suction specific speed, is a quasi non-\ndimensional number used to classify pump impellers as to their type and\nproportions. In Imperial units it is defined as the speed in revolutions per\nminute at which a geometrically similar impeller would operate if it were of\nsuch a size as to deliver one gallon per minute against one foot of hydraulic\nhead. In metric units flow may be in l/s or mÂ³/s and head in m, and care must be\ntaken to state the units used.\n\nPerformance is defined as the ratio of the pump or turbine against a reference\npump or turbine, which divides the actual performance figure to provide a\nunitless figure of merit. The resulting figure would more descriptively be\ncalled the \"ideal-reference-device-specific performance.\" This resulting\nunitless ratio may loosely be expressed as a \"speed,\" only because the\nperformance of the reference ideal pump is linearly dependent on its speed, so\nthat the ratio of [device-performance to reference-device-performance] is also\nthe increased speed the reference device would need to turn, in order to produce\nthe performance, instead of its reference speed of \"1 unit.\"\n\nSpecific speed is used in engineering design where it is thought of as an index\nused to predict desired pump or turbine characteristics; e.g., the general shape\nof a pump's impeller. Often it is used to predict the type of pump or turbine\nrequired for a design flow rate and head. Once the desired specific speed is\nknown, basic dimensions of the unit's components can be easily calculated.\n\nSeveral mathematical definitions of specific speed (all of them actually ideal-device-\nspecific) have been created for different devices and applications.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Specific_speed","recorded":1362375117,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hydraulics","Fluid dynamics","Pumps"],"headings":["Pump specific speed","Net suction specific speed","Turbine specific speed","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/8/2/f8223b4ca52dce355dc038f2766e5627.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/3/05355d3274aed8dc2eca2ab604bd85d3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/9/f09564c9ca56850d4cd6b3319e541aee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/d/c1d9f50f86825a1a2302ec2449c17196.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2/f/b2f5ff47436671b6e533d8dc3614845d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/4/c/34ca9fbf8059ab3e0c2e41be4bba6628.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/7/7b76c990c414b0f3b50a49c13d33af39.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/9/e/09ed817bb052ed278a62fa422527f148.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/7/c/c7c06373467cf5426806cf9d1cb10b91.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/f/0/8f0f65e45e544874eed876c481c38c11.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/0/5/005cfa8383bb38052fc1aa14a5bde41f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/d/b9d99db8626de63193c7fe96273a6cae.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/3/e/83ebf1e52c0751dae18d910f74dc3818.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/9/f09564c9ca56850d4cd6b3319e541aee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/c/44c29edb103a2872f519ad0c9a0fdaaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/d/c1d9f50f86825a1a2302ec2449c17196.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/e/3/ee325ee271f9160c0afa024e40e57493.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/3/cb34e6571f25bed62acd10c2579444e6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/d/2/ad238ad2b8a40306d5dee05dab4d2b78.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Turbomachinery","Dimensionless_quantity","Pump","Impeller","Imperial_unit","Revolutions_per_minute","Hydraulic_head","Figure_of_merit","Impeller","Hydraulic_head","Centrifugal_force","Centrifugal_pump","Axial_flow_pump","Positive_displacement_pump","Net_positive_suction_head","Pelton_wheel","Francis_turbine","Kaplan_turbine","English_unit","Rpm","Horsepower","Metric_unit","Rpm","Kilowatt","Pump","NPSH","Water_turbine"]}
