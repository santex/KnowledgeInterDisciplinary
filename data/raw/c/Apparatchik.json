Billington, Fire in the minds of men,\nTransaction Publishers, 1999, [http://books.google.com/books?id=a4PRx21WVqMC&pg-\n=PA455&dq=apparatchik&ei=Unp5Sve5G6PCM4j-vYUN&client=firefox-\na#v=onepage&q=apparatchik&f=false p. 455], ISBN 0-7658-0471-9, ISBN 978-0-7658-0471-\n6 It often is considered a derogatory term, with negative connotations in\nterms of the quality, competence, and attitude of a person thus\ndescribed.

Thus, the term apparatchik, or \"agent of the\napparatus\" was usually the best possible description of the person's\nprofession and occupation.

Many only entered such positions\nin middle age.
