The ends of the rope are\ntucked (plaited) back into the standing end to form the loop. Originally this\nsplice was described with each end being tucked only about three times. When\nthe splice was made in tarred hemp or cotton this was reasonably safe. With\nmodern synthetic ropes, five complete tucks is a minimum and additional tucks\nare recommended for critical loads.
