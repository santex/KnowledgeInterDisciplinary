Genetic variation is important because it provides the genetic\nmaterial for natural selection. Genetic variation is brought about by mutation,\nwhich is a permanent change in the chemical structure of a gene. Polyploidy is\nan example of chromosomal mutation. Polyploidy is a condition wherein organisms\nhave three or more sets of genetic variation (3n or more).\n","linknr":126,"url":"Genetic_variation","recorded":1362486375,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Population genetics"],"headings":["Among individuals within a population","Between populations","Measurement","Sources","Maintenance in populations","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Wheat.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mendelian_inheritance#law_of_independent_assortment","the_\"second_law\""]],"members":[],"related":["Allele","Gene","Population","Natural_selection","Phenotype","Enzyme","Protein_electrophoresis","Nucleotide","DNA_sequence","Amino_acid","Peptide_sequence","Genetic_drift","Mutation","Chromosome","Sexual_reproduction","Zygosity","Ploidy","Zygosity","Genetic_diversity","Human_genetic_variation","National_Council_for_Science_and_the_Environment"]}
