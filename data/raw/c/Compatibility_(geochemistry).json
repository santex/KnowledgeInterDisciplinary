{"cursor":"2011","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In geochemistry, 'compatibility' is a measure of how readily a particular trace\nelement substitutes for a major element within a mineral.\n\nCompatibility of an ion is controlled by two things: its valence and its ionic\nradius. Both must approximate those of the major element for the trace element\nto be compatible in the mineral. For instance, olivine (an abundant mineral in\nthe upper mantle) has the chemical formula (Mg,Fe) 2SiO 4.\nNickel, with very similar chemical behaviour to iron and magnesium, substitutes\nreadily for them and hence is very compatible in the mantle. The compatibility\nof an element in a rock is a weighted average of its compatibility in each of\nthe minerals present. By contrast, an incompatible element is one that is least\nstable within its crystal structure.\n\nCompatibility controls the partitioning of different elements during melting. If\nan element is incompatible in a rock, it partitions into a melt as soon as\nmelting begins.\n\nIn general, when an element is referred to as being âcompatibleâ without\nmentioning what rock it is compatible in, the mantle is implied. Thus\nincompatible elements are those that are enriched in the continental crust and\ndepleted in the mantle. Examples include: rubidium, barium, uranium, and\nlanthanum. Compatible elements are depleted in the crust and enriched in the\nmantle, with examples nickel and titanium.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Compatibility_(geochemistry)","recorded":1362268776,"links":12,"instances":["geology","chemistry","geology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geochemistry"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["valence","chemistry"],["mantle","geology"],["mantle","geology"],["fractional_crystallization","geology"]],"members":["mantle","valence","fractional_crystallization"],"related":["Geochemistry","Trace_element","Major_element","Mineral","Ion","Valence_(chemistry)","Ionic_radius","Olivine","Mantle_(geology)","Nickel","Iron","Magnesium","Rock_geology","Weighted_mean","Crystal","Melting","Magma","Continental_crust","Rubidium","Barium","Uranium","Lanthanum","Titanium","Magma","Mineral","Isotope_geochemistry","Continental_crust","Mantle_(geology)","Igneous_differentiation","Fractional_crystallization_(geology)"]}
