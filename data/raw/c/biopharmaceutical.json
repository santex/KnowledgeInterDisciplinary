{"cursor":"8352","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":The term'biopharmacology' describes a field of research closely related to\n[[pharmacokinetics]], sometimes called biopharmacy.\n\n'Biopharmaceutics' is the field of study concerning biopharmaceuticals, medical\ndrugs (see pharmacology) produced using biotechnology. They include proteins\n(including antibodies), nucleic acids (DNA, RNA or antisense oligonucleotides)\nand living microorganisms like virus and bacteria where the virulence of viruses\nand bacteria is reduced by the process of attenuation, they can be used for\ntherapeutic or [[in vivo]] diagnostic purposes, and are produced by means other\nthan direct extraction from a native (non-engineered) biological source.\n{{cite book\n | last = Walsh first = Gary authorlink = coauthors = year = title =\n | Biopharmaceuticals: Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Second Edition\n | publisher = John Wiley & Sons Ltd location = isbn = 0-470-84326-8 (ppc),\n | ISBN 0-470-84327-6 (pbk)\n}} \n\nThe first such substance approved for therapeutic use was biosynthetic 'human'\ninsulin made via recombinant DNA technology. Sometimes referred to as rHI, under\nthe trade name Humulin, was developed by Genentech, but licensed to Eli Lilly\nand Company, who manufactured and marketed the product starting in 1982. \n\nThe large majority of biopharmaceutical products are pharmaceuticals that are\nderived from life forms. Small molecule drugs are not typically regarded as\nbiopharmaceutical in nature by the industry. However members of the press and\nthe business and financial community often extend the definition to include\npharmaceuticals not created through biotechnology. That is, the term has become\nan often-used buzzword for a variety of different companies producing new,\napparently high-tech pharmaceutical products. Research and development\ninvestment in new medicines by the biopharmaceutical industry stood at $65.2bn\nin 2008. {{cite web\n| author=BriskFox Financial title=Biopharmaceutical sector sees rising R&D\n| despite credit crunch, finds analysis\n| url=http://www.briskfox.com/open/years/2009_q1/do_v_c44751.php accessdate=2009-03-\n| 11 }}\n\nWhen a biopharmaceutical is developed, the company will typically apply for a\npatent, which is a grant for exclusive manufacturing rights. This is the primary\nmeans by which the developer of the drug can recover the investment cost for\ndevelopment of the biopharmaceutical. The patent laws in the United States and\nEurope differ somewhat on the requirements for a patent, with the European\nrequirements are perceived as more difficult to satisfy. The total number of\npatents granted for biopharmaceuticals has risen significantly since the 1970s.\nIn 1978 the total patents granted was 30. This had climbed to 15,600 in 1995,\nand by 2001 there were 34,527 patent applications. {{cite web\n| author=Luke Foster title=Patenting in the Biopharmaceutical\n| Industry—comparing the US with Europe\n| url=http://scientific.thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/ accessdate=2006-06-\n| 23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060316164416/http://scientific.-\n| thomson.com/free/ipmatters/pii/8180019/ \n| |archivedate = 2006-03-16}}\n\nWithin the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exerts strict\ncontrol over the commercial distribution of a pharmaceutical product, including\nbiopharmaceuticals. Approval can require several years of clinical trials,\nincluding trials with human volunteers. Even after the drug is released, it will\nstill be monitored for performance and safety risks.\n\nThe manufacture of the drug must satisfy the \"current Good Manufacturing\nPractices\" regulations of the FDA. They are typically manufactured in a clean\nroom environment with set standards for the amount of airborne particles.\n","linknr":199,"url":"biopharmaceutical","recorded":1362569414,"links":18,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology","Pharmacology","Pharmaceutical industry"],"headings":["Classification of biopharmaceuticals","Uses","Large scale production","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pharming","genetics"]],"members":["pharming"],"related":["Biopharmacology","Pharmacology","Biotechnology","Proteins","Antibody","Nucleic_acids","DNA","RNA","Antisense","Oligonucleotide","Virus","Bacteria","Organism","Insulin","Recombinant_DNA","Humulin","Genentech","Eli_Lilly_and_Company","Buzzword","United_States","Europe","United_States","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Clean_room","Factor_VIII","Factor_IX","Tissue_plasminogen_activator","Hormones","Insulin","Erythropoietin","Colony_stimulating_factors","Interferons","Interleukin","Vaccines","Hepatitis_B","Antigen","Monoclonal_antibodies","Tumour_necrosis_factor","Erythropoietin","Anaemia","Interferon-α","Leukaemia","IFNB1","Multiple_sclerosis","Monoclonal_antibody","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Neutropenia","Glucocerebrosidase","Gaucher's_disease","Escherichia_coli","Cell_culture","Plant_tissue_culture","Moss","Bioreactor","Photo-bioreactors","Ralf_Reski","Bacteria","Virus","Mycoplasma","Plant-made_pharmaceuticals","Transgenic","Pronuclear_microinjection","Nature_Biotechnology","Goat","ATryn","European_Medicines_Agency","Biologic_medical_product","Genetic_engineering","List_of_recombinant_proteins","List_of_pharmaceutical_companies","Nanobiopharmaceutics","Pharming_(genetics)","Medical_science_liaison"]}
