{"cursor":"8567","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nEstablished in 2002, the 'Nursing and Midwifery Council' (NMC) is a statutory\nbody set up by the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the\n[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20020253.htm Nursing and Midwifery Order\n2001]. The NMC is the UK regulator for nursing and midwifery professions with a\nstated aim to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the public. The NMC\nmaintains a register of all nurses, midwives and specialist community public\nhealth nurses eligible to practise within the UK and by setting and reviewing\nstandards for their education, training, conduct and performance. The NMC also\ninvestigates allegations of impaired fitness to practise (i.e. where these\nstandards are not met).\n\nThere are currently close to 700,000 nurses and midwives on the NMC register,\nmaking the NMC the largest healthcare regulator in the UK.  In April\n2008, the NMC launched its new 'code' to replace its existing 'Code of Conduct'.\nThe code details the standards of conduct, performance and ethics required of\nnurses and midwives. In addition to being a statutory body, the NMC is also a\ncharity registered with the Charity Commission, charity number 1091434 and in\nScotland with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, charity number\nSC038362. All Council members are trustees of the charity.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council","recorded":1371245490,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:NMC_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/NMC_logo.jpg","/wiki/File:NMC_logo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20020253.htm","/wiki/Nurses","/wiki/Midwives","/wiki/Public_health","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Charity_Commission","/wiki/Office_of_the_Scottish_Charity_Regulator","#From_UKCC_to_NMC","#Criticism","#Accusations_of_bullying_and_racism","#Panorama_controversy","#Regulatory_criticism","#Data_loss","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Jim_Devine","/wiki/John_Smith_(Welsh_politician)","/wiki/British_House_of_Commons","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Council_for_Healthcare_Regulatory_Excellence","/wiki/Charity_Commission","#cite_note-3","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Panorama_(TV_series)","/wiki/Royal_Sussex_County_Hospital","/wiki/Teaching_hospital","/wiki/Brighton","/wiki/England","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Royal_College_of_Nursing","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Council_for_Healthcare_Regulatory_Excellence","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Information_Commissioner%27s_Office","/wiki/Encrypted","/wiki/Courier","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/File:Nursing_symbol.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Nursing_symbol.svg/32px-Nursing_symbol.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Nursing","/wiki/Nursing_in_the_United_Kingdom","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-1","http://www.nmc-uk.org/aArticle.aspx?ArticleID=2349","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","#cite_ref-2","http://web.archive.org/web/20080318214441/http://www.nmc-uk.org/aArticle.aspx?ArticleID=3043","http://www.nmc-uk.org/aArticle.aspx?ArticleID=3043","#cite_ref-3","http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/mar/12/nhs.health3","#cite_ref-4","http://www.nmc-uk.org/aArticle.aspx?ArticleID=3668","/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot","#cite_ref-5","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8003228.stm","#cite_ref-6","http://www.rcn.org.uk/newsevents/news/article/uk/over_15,000_sign_petition_to_support_struck_off_rcn_member","#cite_ref-7","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8303304.stm","#cite_ref-8","https://www.chre.org.uk/_img/pics/library/120702_CHRE_Final_Report_for_NMC_strategic_review_(pdf)_1.pdf","#cite_ref-9","http://www.nmc-uk.org/Press-and-media/Latest-news/Appointment-of-Mark-Addison-as-Chair-of-the-NMC-/","#cite_ref-10","http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/clinical-specialisms/management/grave-concerns-over-appointment-of-new-nmc-chair/5047742.article","#cite_ref-11","http://www.chre.org.uk/media/18/486/","#cite_ref-12","http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/19/nmc_fined_by_ico/","/wiki/The_Register","/w/index.php?title=Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council&action=edit&section=9","http://www.nmc-uk.org","http://www.nmc-review.org","http://www.youtube.com/nmcvideos","http://videos.med.wisc.edu/videoInfo.php?videoid=220","/wiki/Template:Medical_regulation_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Template_talk:Medical_regulation_in_the_United_Kingdom","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Medical_regulation_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=edit","/wiki/Council_for_Healthcare_Regulatory_Excellence","/wiki/General_Chiropractic_Council","/wiki/General_Dental_Council","/wiki/General_Medical_Council","/wiki/General_Optical_Council","/wiki/General_Osteopathic_Council","/wiki/Health_Professions_Council","/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Society_
