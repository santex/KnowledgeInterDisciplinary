The members of the genus are\ncollectively known as cruciferous vegetables, cabbages, or mustards. Crops from\nthis genus are sometimes called cole crops, which is derived from the Latin\ncaulis, meaning stem or cabbage. http://www.wordnik.com/words/caulis\n\nCommon types of brassica used for food include cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli,\nBrussel sprouts, and some types of seeds. The genus is known for containing\nmany important agricultural and horticultural crops. It also includes a number\nof weeds, both wild taxa and escapees from cultivation. It includes over 30\nwild species and hybrids, and numerous additional cultivars and hybrids of\ncultivated origin. Most are annuals or biennials, but some are small shrubs.\nDue to their agricultural importance, Brassica plants have been the subject of\nmuch scientific interest. Six particularly important species (Brassica\ncarinata, B. juncea, B. oleracea, B. napus, B. nigra and B. rapa) are derived\nby combining the chromosomes from three earlier species, as described by the\nTriangle of U theory.\n\nThe genus is native in the wild in western Europe, the Mediterranean and\ntemperate regions of Asia. In addition to the cultivated species, which are\ngrown worldwide, many of the wild species grow as weeds, especially in North\nAmerica, South America, and Australia.\n\nA dislike for cabbage, broccoli et.al. can be due to the Brassica species\ncontaining a chemical similar to phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), a chemical which is\neither bitter or tasteless depending on one's genetic makeup.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Brassica","recorded":1362504865,"links":51,"instances":["brassica_rapa"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Brassica|"],"headings":["Uses","Species","Genome sequencing and genetics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Brassica_rapa_plant.jpg/220px-Brassica_rapa_plant.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["turnip","brassica_rapa"],["turnip","brassica_rapa"]],"members":["turnip"],"related":["Plantae","Angiosperms","Eudicots","Rosids","Brassicales","Brassicaceae","Mustard_plant","Brassicaceae","Cruciferous_vegetables","Cabbage","Cauliflower","Broccoli","Brussel_sprouts","Genus","Agricultural","Horticultural","Weed","Cultivar","Annual_plant","Biennial_plant","Chromosome","Triangle_of_U","Europe","Mediterranean_climate","Asia","North_America","South_America","Australia","Phenylthiocarbamide","Rutabaga","Turnip_(Brassica_rapa)","Kohlrabi","Cabbage","Collard_greens","Cauliflower","Broccoli","Brussel_sprouts","Cabbage","Mustard_seed","Rapeseed","Larva","Lepidoptera","List_of_Lepidoptera_that_feed_on_Brassica","Vitamin_C","Dietary_fiber","3,3'-diindolylmethane","Sulforaphane","Selenium","Steaming","Microwave_oven","Stir_frying","Indole-3-carbinol","Carotenoids","Broccoli","Immune","Antiandrogen","Goitrogen","Biodiesel","Rapeseed","Canola","Rutabaga","Kale","Cabbage","Broccoli","Cauliflower","Brussel_sprout","Kohlrabi","Chinese_cabbage","Turnip_(Brassica_rapa)","Rapini","Cruciferous_vegetables","Gene_nomenclature","Mustard_plant","Triangle_of_U"]}
