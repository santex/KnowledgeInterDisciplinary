Sizes of individual objects have been exaggerated for visibility.]]\n\nThe 'Oort cloud'  (named after Jan Oort), or 'ÃpikâOort cloud', is a hypothesized spherical cloud of predominantly icy\nplanetesimals that may lie roughly 50,000 AU, or nearly a light-year, from the\nSun. This places the cloud at nearly a quarter of\nthe distance to Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun. The Kuiper belt\nand the scattered disc, the other two reservoirs of trans-Neptunian objects, are\nless than one thousandth of the Oort cloud's distance. The outer limit of the\nOort cloud defines the cosmographical boundary of the Solar System and the\nregion of the Sun's gravitational dominance.\n\nThe Oort cloud is thought to comprise two separate regions: a spherical outer\nOort cloud and a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud, or 'Hills cloud'. Objects in the\nOort cloud are largely composed of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.\n\nAstronomers believe that the matter composing the Oort cloud formed closer to\nthe Sun and was scattered far out into space by the gravitational effects of the\ngiant planets early in the Solar System's evolution.\nHowever, citing the Southwest Research Institute, NASA published a 2010 article\nthat includes the following quotation: We know that stars form in\nclusters. The Sun was born within a huge community of other stars that formed in\nthe same gas cloud. In that birth cluster, the stars were close enough together\nto pull comets away from each other via gravity.\n\nIt is therefore speculated that the Oort cloud is, at least partly, the product\nof an exchange of materials between the Sun and its sister stars as they formed\nand drifted apart.\n\nAlthough no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made,\nastronomers believe that it is the source of all long-period and Halley-type\ncomets entering the inner Solar System and many of the centaurs and Jupiter-\nfamily comets as well. The outer Oort cloud is only\nloosely bound to the Solar System, and thus is easily affected by the\ngravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These\nforces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send\nthem towards the inner Solar System. Based on their\norbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but\nsome may still have originated from the Oort cloud. Although the Kuiper belt and the\nscattered disc have been observed and mapped, only four currently known trans-\nNeptunian objects—90377 Sedna, , , and —are considered possible\nmembers of the inner Oort cloud.\n","linknr":989,"url":"Oort_cloud","recorded":1362371903,"links":125,"instances":["magazine","h","hypothetical_star","astrophysics","journal","astronomy","journal","minor_planet","journal","hypothetical_planet","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/oort.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/oort.pdf","http://star.arm.ac.uk/preprints/396.pdf","http://star.arm.ac.uk/preprints/396.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/7031.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/7031.pdf","http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~jjm9638/acm2002/acm2002_05_06.pdf","http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~jjm9638/acm2002/acm2002_05_06.pdf","http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/users/sheppard/pub/Sheppard06smallbodies.pdf","http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/users/sheppard/pub/Sheppard06smallbodies.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/volatiles.pdf","http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/volatiles.pdf"],"categories":["Trans-Neptunian
