{"cursor":"7855","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the genetic code, a 'stop codon' (or 'termination codon') is a nucleotide\ntriplet within messenger RNA that signals a termination of\ntranslation. Proteins are based on polypeptides, which are unique\nsequences of amino acids. Most codons in messenger RNA (from DNA) correspond to\nthe addition of an amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain, which may\nultimately become a protein. Stop codons signal the termination of this process\nby binding release factors, which cause the ribosomal subunits to disassociate,\nreleasing the amino acid chain.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Stop_codon","recorded":1362484000,"links":25,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular genetics","Gene expression","Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["Introduction","Amber, ochre, and opal nomenclature","Hidden stops","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Genetic_code","Nucleotide","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Protein","Amino_acid","Codon","Release_factor","Mnemonic","Selenocysteine","Selenoprotein","SECIS_element","Pyrrolysine","Nonsense_mutations","Bacteriophage","Enterobacteria_phage_T4","Lambda_phage","Virus","Nonsense_mutation","Amber","Ochre","Sydney_Brenner","Opal","Umber","TRNA","Frameshift","Louisiana_State_University","Start_codon","Genetic_code"]}
