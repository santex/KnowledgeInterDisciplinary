{"cursor":"21324","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Graphics' (from Greek graphikos) are visual presentations on some surface, such\nas a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone to brand, inform, illustrate, or\nentertain. Graphics word is derived from the word graph. A graph has x and y\naxis. Same way something which is created in digital word is seen on a digital\nscreen, this screen also has x and y axis. So the output on any digital device\nis termed as graphics. In other words an image that is generated by a computer\ncalled graphics. The pictorial representation and manipulation of data, as used\nin computer-aided design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts,\nand in educational and recreational programs.\n\nExamples are photographs, drawings, Line Art, graphs, diagrams, typography,\nnumbers, symbols, geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other\nimages. Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color. Graphic design may\nconsist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography\nalone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other\nelement. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association\nwith other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a\ndistinctive style.\n\nGraphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version,\nsuch as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential\nfeatures, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics\nmay become blurred.\n","linknr":402,"url":"Graphics","recorded":1362667778,"links":62,"instances":["philosophy","archaeology","computing","computer","information","printmaking","semiotics","web_browser","graphics","philosophy","arts","computer","photography","video_game","film","2005_film","software","software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer
