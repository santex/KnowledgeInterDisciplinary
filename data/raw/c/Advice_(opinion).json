{"cursor":"11724","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] 'Advice' (also called 'exhortation') is a form of relating personal or\ninstitutional opinions, belief systems, values, recommendations or guidance\nabout certain situations relayed in some context to another person, group or\nparty often offered as a guide to action and/or conduct. Put a little more\nsimply, an advice message is a recommendation about what might be thought, said,\nor otherwise done to address a problem, make a decision, or manage a situation.\nAdvice is believed to be theoretical, and is often considered taboo as well as\nhelpful. The kinds of advice can range from systems of instructional and\npractical toward more esoteric and spiritual, and is often attributable toward\nproblem solving, strategy seeking, and solution finding, either from a social\nstandpoint or a personal one. Advice may pertain to relationships, lifestyle\nchanges, legal choices, business goals, personal goals, career goals, education\ngoals, religious beliefs, personal growth, motivation, inspiration and so on.\nAdvice is not pertinent to any solid criteria, and may be given freely, or only\ngiven when asked upon. In some cultures advice is socially unacceptable to be\nreleased unless requested. In other cultures advice is given more openly. It\nmay, especially if it is expert advice such as legal advice or methodological\nadvice also be given only in exchange for payment.\n\nMany expressions and quotations have been used to describe the status of advice,\nwhether given, or received. One such expression is \"Advice is what we ask for\nwhen we already know the answer but wish we didn't.\" (Erica Jong, How to Save\nYour Own Life, 1977). Advice is like water, you drink it to replenish your soul.\nThis particular quotation pertains the belief system that states that the\nanswers to one's questions are within themselves, and do not come from any\nexternal stimuli. The accuracy of this particular belief is often disputed among\ntheologians, philosophers, etc. However, a person who would hold such a belief,\nwould \"advise\" another person to seek the answers out from within one's own\nesoteric and inner spiritual natures.\n\nAdvice when adhered to and followed may be beneficial, non-beneficial, damaging,\nnon-damaging, partially beneficial and partially damaging, in reference to\npersonal or social paradigms. In other words, not all advice is either \"all\ngood\" or \"all bad\". Many people consider unrequested advice to be paternalistic\nand patronizing and are thus offended.\n\nTherefore some people may come to the conclusion that advice is morally better\nto be left out of the equation altogether, and this theory is included within\nthe following quote (author unknown): \"The best advice is this: Don't take\nadvice and don't give advice.\" Yet, often in society advice has been helpful. A\nmore day to day example would be \"eat your vegetables\" or \"don't drink and\ndrive.\" If this advice is adhered to we can see that the benefits would outweigh\nthe consequences.\n\nGrammatically speaking, advice is an uncountable noun, like rice or milk.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Advice_(opinion)","recorded":1363505892,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Le_bon_conseil.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Le_bon_conseil.jpg/250px-Le_bon_conseil.jpg","/wiki/File:Le_bon_conseil.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Madou","/wiki/Opinion","/wiki/Taboo","/wiki/Education","/wiki/Esoteric","/wiki/Spirituality","/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship","/wiki/Education","/wiki/Religious","/wiki/Motivation","/wiki/Erica_Jong","#Advice-Giving_and_Advice-Taking_in_the_Social_Sciences","#Background_Information","#Social_Science_Definitions_of_.22Advice.22","#Methodological_advice","#See_also","#References","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Psychology","/wiki/Economics","/wiki/Decision-making","/wiki/Organizational_behavior","/wiki/Human_resources","/wiki/Human_communication","#cite_note-organizational2006-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Laboratory","#cite_note-organizational2006-1","/wiki/Literature_review","#cite_note-organizational2006-1","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Sex_differences_in_humans","#cite_note-8","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-organizational2006-1","#cite_note-organizational1-9","#cite_note-10","/wiki/Social_support","/wiki/Accuracy","/wiki/Autonomy","#cite_note-organizational1-9","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Research_methodology","/wiki/Statistical_consultant","/wiki/Researcher","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","/wiki/Research_question","/wiki/Scientific_hypothesis","/wiki/Psychological_test","/wiki/Research_design","/wiki/Data_analysis","/wiki/Scientific_publishing","#cite_note-13","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Judge%E2%80%93advisor_system","/wiki/Protrepsis_and_paraenesis","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit&section=6","#cite_ref-organizational2006_1-0","#cite_ref-organizational2006_1-1","#cite_ref-organizational2006_1-2","#cite_ref-organizational2006_1-3","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-organizational1_9-0","#cite_ref-organizational1_9-1","#cite_ref-10","http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/","http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/","#cite_ref-11","#cite_ref-12","#cite_ref-13","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&oldid=534111290","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Ethics","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Advice+%28opinion%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Advice+%28opinion%29","/wiki/Advice_(opinion)","/wiki/Talk:Advice_(opinion)","#","/wiki/Advice_(opinion)","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Advice_(opinion)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Advice_(opinion)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&oldid=534111290","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Advice_%28opinion%29&id=534111290","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Advice+%28opinion%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Advice+%28opinion%29&oldid=534111290&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Advice_(opinion)&pri
