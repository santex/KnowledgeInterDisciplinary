{"cursor":"46319","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'conflict of interest' ('COI') occurs when an individual or organization is\ninvolved in multiple interests, one of which could possibly corrupt the\nmotivation for an act in another.\n\nThe presence of a conflict of interest is independent from the execution of\nimpropriety. Therefore, a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily\ndefused before any corruption occurs. A widely used definition is: âA conflict\nof interest is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional\njudgment or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a\nsecondary interest.â Lo and Field (2009). The definition originally appeared\nin Thompson (1993). Primary interest refers to the principal goals of the\nprofession or activity, such as the protection of clients, the health of\npatients, the integrity of research, and the duties of public office. Secondary\ninterest includes not only financial gain but also such motives as the desire\nfor professional advancement and the wish to do favors for family and friends,\nbut conflict of interest rules usually focus on financial relationships because\nthey are relatively more objective, fungible, and quantifiable. The secondary\ninterests are not treated as wrong in themselves, but become objectionable when\nthey are believed to have greater weight than the primary interests. The\nconflict in a conflict of interest exists whether or not a particular individual\nis actually influenced by the secondary interest. It exists if the circumstances\nare reasonably believed (on the basis of past experience and objective evidence)\nto create a risk that decisions may be unduly influenced by secondary interests.\n\nWilliam K. Black insists that \"Conflicts of interest matter.\" Black (2005,\npp. 253-254) In the run up to the Savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and\nearly 1990s, control frauds like Charles Keating were able to get legislators\nlike Speaker of the House Jim Wright, the Keating Five Senators and majorities\nin both the US House and Senate to suppress investigations of massive\ncriminality until their Ponzi schemes finally collapsed. Only then did citizen\npressure and media involvement force political action. Then regulators filed\nthousands of criminal referrals that translated into over a thousand felony\nconvictions. The current foreclosure and Subprime mortgage crisis is similar to\nthe run up to the S&L crisis with zero criminal referrals and zero prosecutions\nof key finance executives. Black calls this the de facto decriminalization of\nelite financial fraud. {{cite web |url= http://www.nextnewdeal.net/2011-will-bring-more-de-facto-decriminalization-\nelite-financial-fraud |title= 2011 Will Bring More De facto Decriminalization of\nElite Financial Fraud |last= Black |first= William K. |authorlink= William K.\nBlack |date= Dec. 28, 2010 |publisher= Next New Deal: Blog of the Roosevelt\nInstitute |accessdate= |September 9, 2012 }} {{cite web |url= http://therealnew-\ns.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=767&Itemid=74&jumival=8713\n|title= Black Report: No Criminal Prosecution of Wall St. and Who is the\nEuropean, Romney or Obama? |last= Black |first= William K. |authorlink= William\nK.
