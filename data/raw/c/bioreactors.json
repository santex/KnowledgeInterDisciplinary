{"cursor":"8289","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'bioreactor' may refer to any manufactured or engineered device or system\nthat supports a biologically active environment. In one case, a\nbioreactor is a vessel in which a chemical process is carried out which\ninvolves organisms or biochemically active substances derived from such\norganisms. This process can either be aerobic or anaerobic. These bioreactors\nare commonly cylindrical, ranging in size from litres to cubic metres, and are\noften made of stainless steel.\n\nA bioreactor may also refer to a device or system meant to grow cells or tissues\nin the context of cell culture. These devices are being developed for use in\ntissue engineering or biochemical engineering.\n\nOn the basis of 'mode of operation', a bioreactor may be classified as batch,\nfed batch or continuous (e.g. a continuous stirred-tank reactor model). An\nexample of a continuous bioreactor is the chemostat.\n\nOrganisms growing in bioreactors may be suspended or immobilized. A simple\nmethod, where cells are immobilized, is a Petri dish with agar gel. Large scale\nimmobilized cell bioreactors are: *moving media, also known as Moving Bed\nBiofilm Reactor (MBBR) *packed bed *fibrous bed *membrane\n","linknr":236,"url":"bioreactors","recorded":1362500385,"links":34,"instances":["device","mbbr","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/ux267q4q14736845/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Biotechnology","Biological engineering","Bioreactors|"],"headings":["Bioreactor design","Photobioreactor","Sewage treatment","NASA tissue cloning bioreactor","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0e/Final_half_coil_vessel.JPG/210px-Final_half_coil_vessel.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Bioreactor_principle.svg/210px-Bioreactor_principle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Pg166_bioreactor.jpg/250px-Pg166_bioreactor.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Bioreaktor_quer2.jpg/170px-Bioreaktor_quer2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["moving_bed_biofilm_reactor","mbbr"],["agitator","device"],["moving_bed_biofilm_reactor","mbbr"]],"members":["agitator","moving_bed_biofilm_reactor","cell"],"related":["Manufacture","Engineering","Chemical_reaction","Organism","Biochemistry","Chemical_substance","Aerobic_organism","Anaerobic_organism","Stainless_steel","Cell_(biology)","Biological_tissue","Cell_culture","Tissue_engineering","Biochemical_engineering","Batch_reactor","Fed-batch","Continuous_reactor","Continuous_stirred-tank_reactor_model","Chemostat","Petri_dish","Agar","Gel","Moving_Bed_Biofilm_Reactor_(MBBR)","Packed_bed","Fibrous_bed","Biochemical_engineering","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Carbon_dioxide","PH","Agitator_(device)","Sensor","Control_system","Heat_exchangers","Heat_exchanger","Temperature","Refrigeration","Oxygen","Air","Henry's_law","Photobioreactor","Translucent","Tank","Pond","Phototroph","Cyanobacteria","Alga","Moss","Ralf_Reski","Biopharmaceuticals","Photosynthesis","Energy","Sugar","Lipid","Contamination","Bacterium","Fungus","Heterotroph","Sewage","Wastewater","Submersible_mixer","Biochemical_Oxygen_Demand","ATP_test","Auxotrophy","NASA","Tissue_engineering","ATP_test","Biochemical_engineering","Biofuel_from_algae","Biological_hydrogen_production","Bioreactor_landfill","Cell_culture","Chemostat","Digester","Hairy_root_culture","Industrial_biotechnology","Moving_Bed_Biofilm_Reactor_(MBBR)","Septic_tank","Tissue_Engineering","Single-use_bioreactor"]}
