It is named in honor of its former president,\ntheoretical physicist Max Planck.\n\nThe nearly 80 research institutes of the Max Planck Society conduct basic\nresearch in the interest of the general public in the natural sciences, life\nsciences, social sciences, and the arts and humanities. They have a total staff\nof approx. 13,000 permanent employees, including 4,700 scientists, plus around\n11,000 non-tenured scientists and guests. Their budget for 2006 was about â¬1.4\nbillion, with 84% from state and federal funds. {{cite web |title=MPG Facts\nand Figures
