{"cursor":"20867","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" it with a prism is an example of spectroscopy.]] 'Spectroscopy' () is the study\n of the interaction between matter and radiated energy. Historically, spectroscopy originated through the study of\n visible light dispersed according to its wavelength, e.g., by a prism. Later\n the concept was expanded greatly to comprise any interaction with radiative\n energy as a function of its wavelength or frequency. Spectroscopic data is\n often represented by a spectrum, a plot of the response of interest as a\n function of wavelength or frequency.\n","linknr":668,"url":"Spectroscopy","recorded":1362569877,"links":81,"instances":["physics","physics","physics","color","optics"],"pdf":["http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf2006/fpl_2006_wang002.pdf","http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf2006/fpl_2006_wang002.pdf"],"categories":["Spectroscopy|","Observational
