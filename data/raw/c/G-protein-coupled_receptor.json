They are\ncalled transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane, and\nthey are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell\nmembrane seven times.\n\nG protein-coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast,\nchoanoflagellates, and animals. The ligands that\nbind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors,\npheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters, and vary in size from small\nmolecules to peptides to large proteins. G protein-coupled receptors are\ninvolved in many diseases, and are also the target of approximately 40% of all\nmodern medicinal drugs. The 2012 Nobel\nprize in chemistry was awarded to Brian Kobilka and Robert Lefkowitz for their\nwork that was \"crucial for understanding how G-proteinâcoupled receptors\nfunction.\"\n\nThere are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-\ncoupled receptors: the cAMP signal pathway and the phosphatidylinositol signal\npathway. When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes\na conformational change in the GPCR, which allows it to act as a guanine\nnucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated G-\nprotein by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP. The G-protein's Î± subunit,\ntogether with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the Î² and Î³ subunits to\nfurther affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins\ndirectly depending on the Î± subunit type (G Î±s , G Î±i/o ,\nG Î±q/11 , G Î±12/13 ).\n","linknr":1577,"url":"G-protein-coupled_receptor","recorded":1362567723,"links":50,"instances":["gene","biology","pharmacology","biology","chemistry","biology","molecular_biology","biology","biology","biochemistry","medicine","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2012/popular-chemistryprize2012.pdf","http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2012/popular-chemistryprize2012.pdf","http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=153653&blobname=pnas_0230374100v2_1.pdf","http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=153653&blobname=pnas_0230374100v2_1.pdf"],"categories":["G
