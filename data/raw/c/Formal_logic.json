{"cursor":"60373","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Mathematical logic' (also 'symbolic logic', 'formal logic', or, less\nfrequently, '[[modern logic]]') is a subfield of mathematics with close\nconnections to the foundations of mathematics, theoretical computer science\nand philosophical logic. Undergraduate texts include Boolos, Burgess, and\nJeffrey (2002), Enderton (2001), and Mendelson (1997). A classic graduate text\nby Shoenfield (2001) first appeared in 1967. The field includes both the\nmathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other\nareas of mathematics. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the\nstudy of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of\nformal proof systems.\n\nMathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory,\nrecursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic,\nparticularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science\n(particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses\nadditional topics not detailed in this article; see logic in computer science\nfor those.\n\nSince its inception, mathematical logic has both contributed to, and has been\nmotivated by, the study of foundations of mathematics. This study began in the\nlate 19th century with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry,\narithmetic, and analysis. In the early 20th century it was shaped by David\nHilbert's program to prove the consistency of foundational theories. Results of\nKurt GÃ¶del, Gerhard Gentzen, and others provided partial resolution to the\nprogram, and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency. Work in set\ntheory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of\nsets, although there are some theorems that cannot be proven in common axiom\nsystems for set theory. Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics\noften focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in\nparticular formal systems (as in reverse mathematics) rather than trying to find\ntheories in which all of mathematics can be developed.\n","linknr":1048,"url":"Formal_logic","recorded":1362668930,"links":78,"instances":["complexity","mathematics","structure","computer_science","mathematician","mathematics","mathematical_logic","logic","mathematical_logic","order","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/lectures/logic/ws03/ml.pdf","http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/lectures/logic/ws03/ml.pdf","http://www.ams.org/notices/200106/fea-woodin.pdf"],"categories":["Mathematical
