This is\nimportant because DNA is wrapped around histones, and DNA expression is\nregulated by acetylation and de-acetylation. Its action is opposite to that of\nhistone acetyltransferase. HDAC proteins are now also called lysine deacetylases\n(KDAC), to describe their function rather than their target, which also includes\nnon-histone proteins.\n","linknr":646,"url":"Histone_deacetylase","recorded":1362481199,"links":23,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linear amides"],"headings":["HDAC super family","Classes of HDACs in higher eukaryotes","Subtypes","Subcellular distribution","Function","HDAC inhibitors","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/2vqj.png/220px-2vqj.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["crosstalk","biology"]],"members":["crosstalk","transcription"],"related":["HDAC4","Protein_Data_Bank","Enzyme_Commission_number","Enzyme","Acetyl_group","Lysine","Amino_acid","Histone","DNA","Histone_acetyltransferase","Acetylpolyamine_amidohydrolase","Acetoin_utilization_protein","HDAC1","Androgen_receptor","Small_heterodimer_partner","P53","MyoD","E2F1","STAT3","P21","P27","HDAC2","Glucocorticoid_receptor","YY1","BCL6","STAT3","HDAC3","Small_heterodimer_partner","YY1","GATA1","RELA","STAT3","MEF2D","HDAC8","SMG5","HDAC4","GCM1","GATA1","Heterochromatin_protein_1","RFXANK","Chondrocyte","HDAC5","GCM1","SMAD7","Heterochromatin_protein_1","PHB2","Estrogen_receptor","HDAC7","PLAG1","PLAG2","HIF1A","BCL6","Endothelin_receptor","ACTN1","ACTN4","Androgen_receptor","KAT5","MMP10","HDAC9","FOXP3","HDAC6","HSP90","Small_heterodimer_partner","SMAD7","RUNX2","HDAC10","Sirtuin","Sirtuin_1","SIRT2","SIRT3","SIRT4","SIRT5","SIRT6","SIRT7","Sir2","HDAC11","Trichostatin_A","Sir2","Tubulin","Hsp90","Cortactin","Amine","Lysine","Arginine","Phosphate_group","Acetylation","Amide","Chromatin","Transcription_(genetics)","KEGG","Signal_transduction","Notch_signaling_pathway","Cell_cycle","Chronic_myeloid_leukemia","Crosstalk_(biology)","HDAC1","HDAC2","GAD67","Post-translational_modification","Phosphorylation","Protein_kinase","Phosphatases","Acetylation","Transcription_factor","Co-regulator","HDAC6","Aggresomes","Ubiquitin","Dynein","PTEN","Phosphoinositol","AKT","PI3_kinase","PCAF","SIRT1","HDAC1","APEX1","Oxidative_stress","DNA_repair","Parathyroid_hormone","NF-κB","HDAC3","Neurodegenerative_diseases","Vorinostat","Epigenetic","Trichostatin_A","Histone_acetyltransferase","Histone_deacetylase_inhibitor","Histone_methyltransferase","Histone-Modifying_Enzymes","RNA_polymerase_control_by_chromatin_structure","Merck_&_Co."]}
