{"cursor":"7833","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'dichroic filter', 'thin-film filter', or interference filter is a very\naccurate color filter used to selectively pass light of a small range of colors\nwhile reflecting other colors. By comparison, 'dichroic mirrors' and 'dichroic\nreflectors' tend to be characterized by the color(s) of light that they\nreflect, rather than the color(s) they pass. (See dichroism for the etymology\nof the term.)\n\nUsed before a light source, a dichroic filter produces light that is perceived\nby humans to be highly saturated (intense) in color. Although costly, such\nfilters are popular in architectural [http://www.operaen.dk/site/OplevTeat-\neret/Galleri/Scenerne/Scener%20og%20huse/Operaen.aspx?sc_lang=en The Copenhagen\nOpera House] and theatrical applications.\n\nUsed behind a light source, dichroic reflectors commonly reflect visible light\nforward while allowing the invisible infrared light (radiated heat) to pass out\nof the rear of the fixture, resulting in a beam of light that is \"cooler\". Many\nquartz halogen bulbs have an integrated dichroic reflector for this purpose,\nbeing originally designed for use in slide projectors to avoid melting the\nslides, but now widely used for interior home and commercial lighting. This\nimproves whiteness by removing excess red, however it poses a serious fire\nhazard if used in recessed or enclosed luminaires by allowing infrared radiation\ninto those luminaires. For these applications non cool beam (ALU or Silverback)\nlamps must be used.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Dichroic_filter","recorded":1362896637,"links":19,"instances":["color_theory","wave_propagation","optics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Optical filters","Thin-film optics","Stage lighting"],"headings":["Theory","Applications","Advantages of dichroic filters","Disadvantages of dichroic filters","Other uses of dichroic filters","Further reading","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Dichroic_filters.jpg/300px-Dichroic_filters.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Nocb.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["filter","optics"],["reflection","physics"],["saturation","color_theory"],["interference","wave_propagation"],["filter","optics"]],"members":["saturation","interference","filter","reflection"],"related":["Interference_filter","Color","Filter_(optics)","Light","Reflection_(physics)","Dichroism","Perception","Saturation_(color_theory)","Architecture","Stage_lighting","Infrared","Heat","Incandescent_light_bulb","MR16","Luminaire","Infrared","Luminaire","Aluminium","Silver","Thin-film_interference","Interference_(wave_propagation)","Optical_coating","Refractive_index","Glass","Vacuum_deposition","Frequency","Wavelength","Passband","Fabry–Pérot_interferometer","White","Video_projector","Professional_video_camera","Dichroic_prism","Luminaire","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","Fluorescence_microscopy","Beam_splitter","LCD_projector","Passband","Stopband","Laser","National_Ignition_Facility","Jewelry","Angle_of_incidence","Iridescence","Earring","Spatial_filter","Infitec","Dolby_Labs","Stereoscopic","Color_gel","Dielectric_mirror","Fabry–Pérot_interferometer","Filter_(optics)","Holographic_Versatile_Disc","Thin-film_optics"]}
