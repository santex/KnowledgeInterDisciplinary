It is an extension of the idea of evidence-based medicine to\nall areas of public policy. An important aspect of evidence-based policy is the\nuse of scientifically rigorous studies such as randomized controlled trials to\nidentify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes.\nHowever, some areas of knowledge are not well serviced by quantitative research,\nleading to debate about the methods and instruments that are considered critical\nfor the collection of relevant evidence. Good data, analytical skills and\npolitical support, as such, are seen as the important elements. [http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/96208/03-\nchapter2.pdf Head, B. (2009) Evidence-based policy: principles and requirements]\nRetrieved 4 June 2010\n\nAlthough evidence-based policy can be traced as far back as the fourteenth\ncentury, it was more recently popularized by the Blair Government in the United\nKingdom. http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/-\n85836/20090204-evidence-based-\npolicy.pdf [http://www.pc.gov.au/speeches/cs20090204 Banks, G. (2009).\nEvidence-based policy making: What is it? How do we get it?] Retrieved 4 June\n2010 The Blair Government said they wanted to end the ideological led-\nbased decision making for policy making. For example, a\nUK Government white paper published in 1999 (\"Modernising Government\") noted\nthat Government \"must produce policies that really deal with problems, that are\nforward-looking and shaped by evidence rather than a response to short-term\npressures; that tackle causes not symptoms\". {{cite web\n  | last = Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs first = authorlink\n  | = Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs title = Evidence-based\n  | policy making date = 21 September 2006 url =\n  | http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/policy/evidence/index.htm accessdate = 6\n  | March 2010}}\n\nEvidence-based policy is associated with Adrian Smith because in his 1996\npresidential address to the Royal Statistical Society, Smith questioned the\ncurrent process of policy making and urged for a more âevidence-based approachâ\ncommenting that it has âvaluable lessons to\nofferâ.
