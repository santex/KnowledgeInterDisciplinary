The\nsite also provides machine translation and web search.\n\nReference.com was launched by InReference, Inc in February, 1997. The\nsite was later acquired by Lexico Publishing Group, LLC. In 2005, Lexico\nannounced that Reference.com would begin offering searches of Wikipedia\ncontent. In mid-2007, the site typically ranked in the mid-200s among\nthe most popular websites on the Internet. The\npopularity of dictionary.com had been greatly boosted by Google's practice of\noffering a link at the top of their search results that go to the dictionary.com\ndefinition. This exclusive relationship was terminated without explanation to\nthe public when the Google links were redirected to definitions at Answers.com.\n(In December of 2009, the Answers.com links were replaced with Google's own\ndictionary.) More recently, Google added a dictionary.com definition link for\ncertain search words in a non-exclusive relationship (along with links to\ndefinitions from a few other commercial reference websites). On 3 July 2008, IAC\nacquired Lexico Publishing Group, LLC and its three properties: Thesaurus.com,\nReference.com, and Dictionary.com.\n\nReference.com reproduces content from external sources. The site's\nsources include other online dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a search of terms\nfound on other websites such as Wikipedia and the CIA World Factbook. The site\ncan also search Usenet groups and other mailing lists.\n\nReference.com in 2010 topped the list compiled by The Wall Street Journal\nranking websites by how many third-party tracking cookies were added to the\nuser's computer. Reference.com added 234 tracking cookies when encountering a\nfirst-time user.\n","linknr":194,"url":"Reference.com","recorded":1362566888,"links":15,"instances":["company"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Online dictionaries","American websites","Websites which mirror Wikipedia","IAC (company)","Internet properties established in 1997"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Reference-com_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Increase_Negative.svg/11px-Increase_Negative.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["iac","company"],["iac","company"]],"members":["iac"],"related":["Encyclopedia","Dictionary","Thesaurus","IAC_(company)","Encyclopedia","Thesaurus","Dictionary","Machine_translation","Web_search_engine","Wikipedia","Google","Answers.com","IAC_(company)","CIA_World_Factbook","Usenet","Mailing_list","The_Wall_Street_Journal"]}
