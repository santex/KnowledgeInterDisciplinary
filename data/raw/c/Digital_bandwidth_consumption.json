Forouzan,\nData communications and networking, McGraw-Hill, 2007 are terms used to\nrefer to various bit-rate measures, representing the available or consumed data\ncommunication resources expressed in bits per second or multiples of it (bit/s,\nkbit/s, Mbit/s, Gbit/s, etc.).\n\nNote that in textbooks on signal processing, wireless communications, modem\ndata transmission, digital communications, electronics, etc., the word\n'bandwidth' is used to refer to analog signal bandwidth measured in hertz. The\nconnection is that according to Hartley's law, the digital data rate limit (or\nchannel capacity) of a physical communication link is proportional to its\nbandwidth in hertz.\n","linknr":197,"url":"Digital_bandwidth_consumption","recorded":1362676820,"links":23,"instances":["signal_processing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronics terminology"],"headings":["Network bandwidth capacity","Network bandwidth consumption","Asymptotic bandwidth","Multimedia bandwidth","Bandwidth in web hosting","Internet connection bandwidths","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bandwidth","signal_processing"]],"members":["bandwidth"],"related":["Computer_networking","Computer_science","Andrew_S._Tanenbaum","Douglas_Comer","Fred_Halsall","Behrouz_A._Forouzan","Bit-rate","Signal_processing","Wireless_communications","Modem","Data_transmission","Digital_communications","Electronics","Signal_bandwidth","Hertz","Hartley's_law","Channel_capacity","Net_bit_rate","Channel_capacity","Maximum_throughput","Bandwidth_test","Hartley's_law","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Throughput","Goodput","Bandwidth_shaping","Bandwidth_management","Bandwidth_throttling","Bandwidth_cap","Bandwidth_allocation","Bandwidth_allocation_protocol","Dynamic_bandwidth_allocation","Asymptotic_bandwidth","Throughput","Greedy_source","Average_bitrate","Data_compression","Source_coding","Web_hosting_service","Net_bitrate","List_of_device_bandwidths","ADSL_Lite","Digital_Signal_1","E-carrier","Ethernet","802.11b","Digital_Signal_3","802.11g","Fast_Ethernet","OC3","802.11n","OC12","Gigabit_Ethernet","OC48","OC192","10_Gigabit_Ethernet","100_Gigabit_Ethernet","92_Code","Asymptotic_bandwidth","Bandwidth_cap","Bandwidth_extension","Bandwidth_hogging","Bandwidth_optimization","Bandwidth_test","Bandwidth_theft","Bit_rate","Broadband","Comparison_of_latency_and_throughput","Goodput","List_of_device_bandwidths","Measuring_network_throughput","Narrowband","Signal_processing","Throughput"]}
