Water requires a non-gaseous\nsurface to make the transition from a vapour to a liquid. In the atmosphere,\nthis surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called CCNs.\nWhen no CCNs are present, water vapour can be supercooled at about 8Â°F (-13Â°C)\nfor 5-6 hours before droplets spontaneously form (this is the basis of the\ncloud chamber for detecting subatomic particles). In above freezing\ntemperatures the air would have to be supersaturated to around 400% before the\ndroplets could form.\n\nThe concept of cloud condensation nuclei has led to the idea of cloud seeding,\nthat tries to encourage rainfall by seeding the air with condensation nuclei. It\nhas further been suggested that creating such nuclei could be used for marine\ncloud brightening, a geoengineering technique.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Condensation_nucleus","recorded":1362685297,"links":33,"instances":["meteorology","water"],"pdf":["http://www.sesame-ip.eu/doc/Estuaries_Coasts.pdf"],"categories":["Clouds","Particulates"],"headings":["Size, abundance, and composition","Phytoplankton role","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Aerosol-India.jpg/260px-Aerosol-India.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Phytobloom.jpg/260px-Phytobloom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coalescence","meteorology"],["stratification","water"]],"members":["coalescence","stratification"],"related":["Micrometre","Cloud","Coalescence_(meteorology)","Vapour","Liquid","Water_vapour","Cloud_chamber","Supersaturation","Cloud_seeding","Marine_cloud_brightening","Geoengineering","Particulate","Haze","Humidity","Albedo","Atmospheric_particulate_matter","Clay","Soot","Sulfate","Volcanic","Phytoplankton","Sulfur_dioxide","Volatile_organic_compound","Hygroscopic","Ice_nuclei","Cloud","Climate_change","Solar_variation","Methanesulfonic_acid","Dimethyl_sulfide","Algal_bloom","Climate_change","James_Lovelock","Stratification_(water)","Photosynthesis","Albedo","Bergeron_process","Evapotranspiration","Ice_nucleus","Seed_crystal","Water_cycle"]}
