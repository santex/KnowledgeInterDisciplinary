{"cursor":"33019","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Asymmetric warfare' is war between belligerents whose relative military power\ndiffers significantly, or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly.\n\n\"Asymmetric warfare\" can describe a conflict in which the resources of two\nbelligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact and attempt to\nexploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve\nstrategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the weaker combatants\nattempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality.\n Such strategies may not necessarily be militarized. This is in\ncontrast to symmetric warfare, where two powers have similar military power and\nresources and rely on tactics that are similar overall, differing only in\ndetails and execution.\n\nThe term is frequently used to describe what is also called \"guerrilla warfare\",\n\"insurgency\", \"terrorism\", \"counterinsurgency\", and \"counterterrorism\",\nessentially violent conflict between a formal military and an informal, poorly\nequipped, but resilient opponent.\n","linknr":567,"url":"Asymmetric_warfare","recorded":1362554373,"links":41,"instances":["american_revolution","american_revolution","military","united_states","caw"],"pdf":["http://books.sipri.org/files/RR/SIPRIRR23.pdf","http://books.sipri.org/files/RR/SIPRIRR23.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/class/polisci211z/2.2/Arreguin-Toft%20IS%202001.pdf","http://www.stanford.edu/class/polisci211z/2.2/Arreguin-Toft%20IS%202001.pdf","http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB223.pdf","http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/03summer/meigs.pdf","http://www.ausa.org/PDFdocs/LWPapers/LWP_58.pdf"],"categories":["Warfare
