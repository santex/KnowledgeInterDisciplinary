It follows the cancellation of the\nConstellation Program, and is to replace the retired Space Shuttle. The NASA\nAuthorization Act of 2010 envisions the transformation of the Ares I and Ares V\nvehicle designs into a single launch vehicle usable for both crew and cargo.\n\nThe SLS launch vehicle is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions.\nIts initial version without an upper stage is to lift a payload of 70 metric\ntons to orbit. The final version with an integrated upper Earth Departure Stage\nis to lift 130 metric tons, which would make it the most powerful rocket ever\ncreated.\n\nSLS is to take astronauts and hardware to such destinations as near-Earth\nobjects like asteroids, Lagrangian points, the Moon, and Mars. SLS may also\nsupport trips to the International Space Station, if necessary. The SLS Program\nis integrated with NASA's Orion Program, providing a multipurpose crew vehicle.\nSLS will use the ground operations and launch facilities at NASA's Kennedy Space\nCenter, Florida.\n","linknr":923,"url":"Space_Launch_System","recorded":1362267974,"links":64,"instances":["spacecraft","moon","moon","spacecraft","spacecraft","rocket_family"],"pdf":["http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/581582main_BAH_Executive_Summary.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/581582main_BAH_Executive_Summary.pdf","http://spacepolicyonline.com/pages/images/stories/SLS_budget_Integration_2011-08.pdf","http://spacepolicyonline.com/pages/images/stories/SLS_budget_Integration_2011-08.pdf","http://www.nasawatch.com/images/heft.presentation.pdf","http://www.nasawatch.com/images/heft.presentation.pdf","http://planetary.org/programs/projects/space_advocacy/Planetary_Society_Statement_20110712.pdf","http://planetary.org/programs/projects/space_advocacy/Planetary_Society_Statement_20110712.pdf","http://research.lifeboat.com/ieee.em.pdf","http://research.lifeboat.com/ieee.em.pdf","http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/21.jul2011.vxs.pdf","http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/21.jul2011.vxs.pdf","http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/F9Prop.Depot.pdf","http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/F9Prop.Depot.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/publications/AffordableExplorationArchitecture2009.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/publications/AffordableExplorationArchitecture2009.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf","http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/510449main_SLS_MPCV_90-day_Report.pdf"],"categories":["NASA
