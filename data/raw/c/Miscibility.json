In principle, the term applies also to other phases\n(solids and gases), but the main focus is usually on the solubility of one\nliquid in another. Water and ethanol, for example, are miscible because they mix\nin all proportions.\n\nBy contrast, substances are said to be immiscible if in some proportion, they do\nnot form a solution. For example, diethyl ether is fairly soluble in water, but\nthese two solvents are not miscible because they are not soluble in all\nproportions.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Miscibility","recorded":1362371838,"links":30,"instances":["matter","chemistry","molecule","fraction","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties"],"headings":["Organic compounds","Metals","Effect of entropy","Determination","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Dieselrainbow.jpg/220px-Dieselrainbow.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["homogeneity","physics"],["phase","matter"],["concentration#mass_percentage","fraction"],["water","molecule"],["precipitation","chemistry"]],"members":["phase","precipitation","water","homogeneity"],"related":["Water","Thin-film_optics","Optical_interference","Liquid","Homogeneity_(physics)","Solution","Phase_(matter)","Solubility","Water","Ethanol","Solution","Diethyl_ether","Organic_compound","Hydrocarbon","Alcohol","Ethanol","Carbon","Atom","Octanol","Substituent","Partition_equilibrium","Lipid","Functional_group","Acetic_acid","Valeric_acid","Aldehyde","Ketone","Hydrogen_bond","Water_(molecule)","Chemical_bond","Carbonyl","Oxygen","Metal","Alloy","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Copper","Cobalt","Zinc","Silver","Lead","Silver","Parkes_process","Liquid-liquid_extraction","Configuration_entropy","Polymer","Refractive_index","Emulsion","Multiphasic_liquid","Heteroazeotrope","ITIES"]}
