{"cursor":"1364","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Scribonius Largus' was the court physician to the Roman emperor Claudius.\n\nAbout 47 AD, at the request of Gaius Julius Callistus, the emperor's freedman,\nhe drew up a list of 271 prescriptions (Compositiones), most of them his own,\nalthough he acknowledged his indebtedness to his tutors, to friends and to the\nwritings of eminent physicians. Certain traditional remedies are also\nincluded. The work has no pretensions to style, and contains many\ncolloquialisms. The greater part of it was transferred without acknowledgment\nto the work of Marcellus Empiricus (c. 410), De Medicamentis Empiricis,\nPhysicis, et Rationabilibus, which is of great value for the correction of the\ntext of Largus.\n\nSee the edition of the Compositiones by S. Sconocchia (Teubner 1983), which\nreplaced the well-outdated edition [http://forumromanum.org/literature/scri-\nbonius_largus/conpositiones.html Online but not complete.] of G. Helmreich\n(Teubner 1887).\n","linknr":103,"url":"Scribonius_Largus","recorded":1362485534,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Latin-language writers","Ancient Roman writers","Silver Age Latin writers","Ancient Roman physicians","1st-century Romans"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Physician","Claudius","47_AD","Gaius_Julius_Callistus","Marcellus_Empiricus","S._Sconocchia","Teubner","G._Helmreich"]}
