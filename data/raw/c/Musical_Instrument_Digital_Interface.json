A single MIDI\nlink can carry up to sixteen channels of information, each of which can be\nrouted to a separate device.\n\nMIDI carries event messages that specify notation, pitch and velocity, control\nsignals for parameters such as volume, vibrato, audio panning and cues, and\nclock signals that set and synchronize tempo between multiple devices. These\nmessages are sent to other devices where they control sound generation and other\nfeatures. This data can also be recorded into a hardware or software device\ncalled a sequencer, which can be used to edit the data and to play it back at a\nlater time.\n\nMIDI technology was standardized in 1983 by a panel of music industry\nrepresentatives, and is maintained by the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA).\nAll official MIDI standards are jointly developed and published by the MMA in\nLos Angeles, California, USA, and for Japan, the MIDI Committee of the\nAssociation of Musical Electronics Industry (AMEI) in Tokyo.\n","linknr":1324,"url":"Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface","recorded":1362579528,"links":75,"instances":["software_company","audio","music","music_technology","music","music","music","musical_instrument","computing","theatrical","video_performance_artist","music","music","music","pitch_standard","company","communication","audio_effect","video","audio","software","magazine","music","electrical_engineering","signal_processing","engineer","signal_processing","electricity","instrument","software","electricity","software","information_technology"],"pdf":["http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bello/FMT_files/10_MIDI_soundcontrol.pdf","http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/midi10.pdf","http://nime2008.casapaganini.org/documents/Proceedings/Papers/163.pdf","http://localhostr.com/download/LJUEw0K/midiformat.pdf"],"categories":["MIDI|*","Computer
