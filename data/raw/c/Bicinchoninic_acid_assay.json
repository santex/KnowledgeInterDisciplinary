Smith at the Pierce Chemical Company, is\na biochemical assay for determining the total concentration of protein in a\nsolution (0.5 Î¼g/mL to 1.5 mg/mL), similar to Lowry protein assay, Bradford\nprotein assay or biuret reagent. The total protein concentration is exhibited by\na color change of the sample solution from green to purple in proportion to\nprotein concentration, which can then be measured using colorimetric techniques.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Bicinchoninic_acid_assay","recorded":1362481304,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://media.wiley.com/CurrentProtocols/0471111848/0471111848-sampleUnit.pdf","http://media.wiley.com/CurrentProtocols/0471111848/0471111848-sampleUnit.pdf"],"categories":["Biochemistry methods","Chemical tests"],"headings":["Mechanism","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["copper(ii_sulfate"]],"members":[],"related":["Pierce_Biotechnology","Biochemistry","Assay","Protein","Lowry_protein_assay","Bradford_protein_assay","Biuret_reagent","Colorimetry","Alkaline","PH","Bicinchoninic_acid","Sodium_carbonate","Sodium_bicarbonate","Sodium_tartrate","Copper(II)_sulfate","Peptide_bonds","Redox","Chelate","Ion","Color","Nanometer","Absorption_spectroscopy","Biuret_test"]}
