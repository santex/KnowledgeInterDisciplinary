In other words, she was the most recent\nwoman from whom all living humans today descend, on their mother's side, and\nthrough the mothers of those mothers and so on, back until all lines converge on\none person. Because all mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is generally passed from\nmother to offspring without recombination, all mtDNA in every living person is\ndirectly descended from hers by definition. Mitochondrial Eve is the female\ncounterpart of Y-chromosomal Adam, who is thought to have lived as early as\naround 142,000 years ago, and is the patrilineal most recent common ancestor,\nalthough they lived thousands of years apart.\n\nEach ancestor (of people now living) in the line back to the matrilineal MRCA\nhad female contemporaries such as sisters, female cousins, etc. and some of\nthese female contemporaries may have descendants living now (with one or more\nmales in their descendancy line). But none of the female contemporaries of the\n\"Mitochondrial Eve\" has descendants living now in an unbroken female line.\n\nMitochondrial Eve is estimated to have lived around 200,000 years ago, .
