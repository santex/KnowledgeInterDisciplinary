{"cursor":"12235","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn vertebrates, 'mucus' (adjectival form: \"mucous\") is a slippery secretion\nproduced by, and covering, mucous membranes. Mucous fluid is typically produced\nfrom cells found in mucous glands. Mucous cells secrete products that are rich\nin glycoproteins and water. Mucous fluid may also originate from mixed glands,\nwhich contain both serous and mucous cells. It is a viscous colloid containing\nantiseptic enzymes (such as lysozyme), immunoglobulins, inorganic salts,\nproteins such as lactoferrin, and glycoproteins known as mucins that\nare produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands. This\nmucus serves to protect epithelial cells (the lining of the tubes) in the\nrespiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, visual, and auditory systems in\nmammals; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish. A major function of\nthis mucus is to protect against infectious agents such as fungi, bacteria and\nviruses. The average human body produces about a litre of mucus per\nday.\n\nBony fish, hagfish, snails, slugs, and some other invertebrates also produce\nexternal mucus. In addition to serving a protective function against infectious\nagents, such mucus provides protection against toxins produced by predators, can\nfacilitate movement and may play a role in communication.\n","linknr":301,"url":"Mucus","recorded":1362509183,"links":58,"instances":["biology","zoology"],"pdf":["http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ChoosingWiselySinusitisAAFP.pdf","http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ChoosingWiselySinusitisAAFP.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Acad_Fam_Phys.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Acad_Fam_Phys.pdf"],"categories":["Body fluids","Exocrine system"],"headings":["Respiratory system","Digestive system","Reproductive system","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Mucus_cells.png/220px-Mucus_cells.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epidermis","zoology"],["tissue","biology"]],"members":["tissue","epidermis"],"related":["Vertebrate","Adjectival_form","Mucous_membrane","Glycoprotein","Serous","Viscous","Colloid","Antiseptic","Lysozyme","Immunoglobulin","Inorganic_ions","Lactoferrin","Glycoprotein","Mucins","Goblet_cell","Submucosal_glands","Epithelium","Respiratory","Gastrointestinal","Urogenital","Mammals","Epidermis_(zoology)","Amphibians","Gills","Fish","Infectious_agents","Fungi","Bacteria","Viruses","Osteichthyes","Hagfish","Snail","Slugs","Invertebrates","Infectious_agents","Toxins","Predator","Communication","Respiratory_system","Lung","Phlegm","Nasal_cavity","Mucosa","Airways","Vertebrate_trachea","Bronchus","Bronchioles","Goblet_cells","Submucosal_glands","Pollutant","Allergen","Infectious_agent","Bacteria","Oropharynx","Tissue_(biology)","Nasal_cavity","Respiratory_epithelium","Dried_nasal_mucus","Common_cold","Influenza","Allergy","Asthma","Chronic_bronchitis","Nose","Throat","Expectoration","Phlegm","Bacteria","Virus","Myeloperoxidase","Respiratory_burst","Paranasal_sinus","Sinusitis","Common_cold","Influenza","Cystic_fibrosis","Common_cold","Nasal_irrigation","Allergies","Decongestant","Asthma","Bronchitis","Influenza","Cilium","Respiratory_epithelium","Rhinorrhea","Esophagus","Stomach","Sperm","Seminal_vesicles","Semen","Amino_acid","Prostaglandin","Vitamin_C","Fructose","Empty_nose_syndrome","Spinnbarkeit","Snail_slime","Mucoadhesion","Mucophagy","Sniffle"]}
