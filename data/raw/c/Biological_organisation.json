The traditional\nhierarchy, as detailed below, extends from atoms (or l Organization , it's\nnot spelled as organisation . ower) to biospheres. The higher levels of\nthis scheme are often referred to as 'ecological organization'.\n\nEach level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational , with each\n\"object\" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.\nThe basic principle behind the organization is the concept of [[emergence]]âthe\nproperties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and\nirrelevant at the lower levels.\n\nOrganization furthermore refers to the high degree of order of an organism (in\ncomparison to general objects). Ideally, individual organisms of the\nsame species have the same arrangement of the same structures. For example, the\ntypical human has a torso with two legs at the bottom and two arms on the sides\nand a head on top. It is extremely rare (and usually impossible, due to\nphysiological and biomechanical factors) to find a human that has all of these\nstructures but in a different arrangement.\n\nThe biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas\nof scientific research, particularly in the medical sciences. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more\ndifficultâand likely impossibleâto apply the study of the effects of various\nphysical and chemical phenomena to diseases and body function. For example,\nfields such as cognitive and behavioral neuroscience could not exist if the\nbrain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of\npharmacology could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular\nlevel can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the\necological levels as well. For example, DDT's direct effect occurs at the\nsubcellular level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple\necosystems. Theoretically, a change in one atom could change the entire\nbiosphere.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Biological_organisation","recorded":1362483192,"links":32,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Life"],"headings":["Levels","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Issoria_lathonia.jpg/32px-Issoria_lathonia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/16px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/16px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/16px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["organ","biology"],["domain","biology"]],"members":["domain","organ","tissue","cell"],"related":["Hierarchy","Complex_systems","Biology","Structures","Systems","Life","Reductionistic","Atom","Biosphere","Entropy","Organism","Human","Scientific_research","Medical_sciences","Physical_phenomenon","Chemical_phenomenon","Diseases","Physiology","Cognitive_neuroscience","Behavioral_neuroscience","Neuroscience","Pharmacology","Ecological","DDT","Subcellular","Ecosystem","Atom","Biosphere","Atom","Molecule","Organelle","Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(biology)","Organ_(biology)","Organ_system","Organism","Population","Species","Biocoenosis","Biological_interaction","Ecosystem","Domain_(biology)","Abiotic","Biosphere","Earth's_spheres","Chemical_element","Subatomic_particle","Genome","Gene","Histological","Abiogenesis","Cell_theory","Cellular_differentiation","Composition_of_the_human_body","Evolutionary_biology","Hierachy_of_matter","Human_ecology","Living_systems","Self-organization","Spontaneous_order"]}
