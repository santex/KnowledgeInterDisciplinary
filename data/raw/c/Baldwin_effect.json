{"cursor":"8406","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Baldwin effect', also known as 'Baldwinian evolution' or 'ontogenic\nevolution', is a theory of a possible evolutionary process that was originally\nput forward in 1896 in a paper, \"A New Factor in Evolution,\" by American\npsychologist James Mark Baldwin. The paper proposed a mechanism for specific\nselection for general learning ability. Selected offspring would tend to have an\nincreased capacity for learning new skills rather than being confined to\ngenetically coded, relatively fixed abilities. In effect, it places emphasis on\nthe fact that the sustained behavior of a species or group can shape the\nevolution of that species. The \"Baldwin effect\" is better understood in evo-devo\n(evolutionary developmental biology) literature as a scenario in which a\ncharacter or trait change occurring in an organism as a result of its\ninteraction with its environment becomes gradually assimilated into its\ndevelopmental genetic or epigenetic repertoire (Simpson, 1953; Newman, 2002). In\nthe words of Daniel Dennett,  Thanks to the Baldwin effect, species\ncan be said to pretest the efficacy of particular different designs by\nphenotypic (individual) exploration of the space of nearby possibilities. If a\nparticularly winning setting is thereby discovered, this discovery will create a\nnew selection pressure: organisms that are closer in the adaptive landscape to\nthat discovery will have a clear advantage over those more distant.
