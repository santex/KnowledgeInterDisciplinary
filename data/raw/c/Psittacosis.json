The\nincidence of infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in\npsittacine birds.\n\nIn certain contexts, the word \"psittacosis\" is used when the disease is carried\nby any species of bird belonging to the Psittacidae family, whereas \"ornithosis\"\nis used when other birds carry the disease.\n","linknr":353,"url":"Psittacosis","recorded":1362501593,"links":38,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Respiratory diseases","Zoonoses","Bacterial diseases","Bird diseases","Biological weapons","Poultry diseases"],"headings":["In humans","In birds","Use as a biological weapon","Notable Casualties","Source","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Chlamydophila_psittaci_FA_stain.jpg/230px-Chlamydophila_psittaci_FA_stain.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Blue_heron_chlamydiosis.JPG/220px-Blue_heron_chlamydiosis.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Direct_fluorescent_antibody","Medicine","Pulmonology","Zoonosis","Infectious_diseases","Bacterium","Parrot","Macaw","Cockatiel","Budgerigar","Pigeon","Sparrow","Duck","Chicken","Gull","Psittacidae","Pneumonia","Typhoid_fever","Fever","Arthralgia","Diarrhea","Conjunctivitis","Epistaxis","Leukopenia","Splenomegaly","Headache","Meningitis","Coma","Pneumococcal","X_rays","Endocarditis","Hepatitis","Myocarditis","Arthritis","Keratoconjunctivitis","Encephalitis","Thrombocytopenia","Liver","Mycoplasma","Legionella","Q_fever","Microbiological_culture","Serology","Antibody","National_Institutes_of_Health","Cockatiels","Parakeets","Macaws","Antibiotic","Tetracycline","Doxycycline","Tetracycline","Chloramphenicol","Intravenous","In_vivo","Erythromycin","Pregnant","Antigen","Antibody","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Doxycycline","Tetracycline","Bacteriophage","Biological_weapon","United_States_biological_weapons_program","Middlebury_College","Philip_Selway"]}
