The company broadcasts its events on television\nand the Internet fifty two weeks a year with over a million weekly viewers on\nits primary television program, [[Impact Wrestling]] on Spike. TNA\nalso gains revenue from live events, product licensing, and direct product\nsales. In 2002, Panda Energy International and its head executive, Robert\nCarter, purchased a controlling share (71%) in TNA from co-founder Jerry\nJarrett.  In 2009, Carter and Panda Energy acquired the rest of TNA\n(28%) from its Vice-President and Co-Founder, Jeff Jarrett, placing Carter as\nOwner and Chairman of TNA. Carter's daughter, Dixie, is President of\nthe company.\n\nTNA headquarters is located in Nashville, Tennessee; its operating company 'TNA\nEntertainment, [[Limited liability company|LLC]]'. operates out of Universal\nStudios Florida in Orlando, Florida. The company previously bore the name \"'NWA\nTotal Nonstop Action'\" as, at the time of its formation, it was a member of the\nNational Wrestling Alliance (NWA). TNA was granted exclusive rights to both the\nNWA World Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Tag Team Championship. TNA\nabdicated from the NWA in 2004, but was permitted to continue to use the\nchampionships until the NWA ceased their contract agreement with TNA in May\n2007, after which TNA created its own championship titles.\n\nIn 2004, TNA became the first American wrestling company to make exclusive use\nof a hexagonal wrestling ring (as opposed to the more conventional square ring).\nIn 2010, the company reverted to the original square ring which the company used\nin the Asylum years. The organization also employed the unconventional rule that\na championship can change hands as the result of a disqualification or countout,\nbut has since phased out this rule. TNA produces monthly PPV events and over 100\nlive shows a year. TNA programming is broadcast in more than 120 countries all\nover the world reaching a global audience.\n","linknr":1023,"url":"Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling","recorded":1362374757,"links":65,"instances":["wrestler","wrestler","igf_version","character","tv_channel","professional_wrestling","wrestler","mass","2009","uk_and_ireland","wrestler","2011","wrestler","wrestler","wrestler","wrestler","2009","wrestler","professional_wrestling","wrestler","2008","tv_channel","wrestler","uk_tv_channel","wrestler"],"pdf":["http://oversight-archive.waxman.house.gov/documents/20081231140812.pdf"],"categories":["American
