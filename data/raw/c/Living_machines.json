Aquatic and wetland\nplants, bacteria, algae, protozoa, plankton, snails and other organisms are used\nin the system to provide specific cleansing or trophic functions. The tidal\nprocess operates outdoors in tropical and temperate climates. In colder\nclimates, the system of tanks, pipes and filters may be housed in a greenhouse\nto prevent freezing and raise the rate of biological activity.\n\nThe initial development of the technology in the United States is generally\ncredited to John Todd, and evolved out of the bioshelter concept developed\nat the now-defunct New Alchemy Institute. The Living Machine system falls\nwithin the emerging discipline of ecological engineering, and many systems\nusing earlier generations of the technology are built without being dubbed a\nLiving Machine.\n","linknr":373,"url":"Living_machines","recorded":1362507356,"links":17,"instances":["physiology","biologist","environmental","ecology"],"pdf":["http://www.livingmachines.com/images/uploads/resources/tidal_wetland_living_machine_technology_description.pdf","https://stars.aashe.org/media/secure/15/2/140/701/Wastewater%20letter.pdf"],"categories":["Sewerage","Environmental engineering","Aquatic ecology","Environmental soil science","Pollution control technologies","Systems ecologists"],"headings":["Design theory","Comparison with conventional treatment","Built components","Living Machine System Process","Hydroponics and Aquaculture","Future horizons","List of Living Machines","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Living_Machine_at_Port_of_Portland-interior.jpg/220px-Living_Machine_at_Port_of_Portland-interior.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/29/Oberlin_Living_Machine2.JPG/220px-Oberlin_Living_Machine2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_todd","biologist"],["biota","ecology"],["biota","ecology"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["respiration","physiology"]],"members":["respiration","john_todd","hypoxia","biota"],"related":["U.S._Green_Building_Council","Wastewater_treatment","Wetlands","Bioremediation","Wetland","Bacteria","Algae","Protozoa","Plankton","Snails","John_Todd_(biologist)","Bioshelter","New_Alchemy_Institute","Ecological_engineering","Public_works","Wastewater","Ecovillages","Findhorn_Foundation","Scotland","South_Burlington,_Vermont","Heavy_metals","Biota_(ecology)","Bleach","Toxin","Ecosystem","Biochemical","Biota_(ecology)","Photosynthetic","Oxygenate","Biofilms","Heavy_metals","Biodiversity","Ecosystem","Sewage_treatment","Sewage_treatment","Chlorine","United_States","Biosolids","Aluminum","Municipal","Constructed_wetlands","Sewage_treatment","Applied_ecology","Biofilters","John_Todd","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Turbidity","Anaerobic_organism","Biofilter","Humus","Photosynthetic","Algae","Oxygen","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Oxygen","Metabolism","Respiration_(physiology)","Cell_growth","Photosynthetic","Macrophytes","Bacteria","Minerals","Species","Nutrient","Nitrification","Ammonia","Nitrates","Microbial","Calcium_carbonate","Catalyst","Nitrates","Nitrogen","Volatilisation","Coliform","Pathogen","Activated_sludge","Hydroponic","Water_hyacinth","Microbes","Biofilm","Plankton","Zooplankton","Plankton","Microbes","Plankton","Mollusks","Zooplankton","Ecological_engineering","Ecological_engineering","Phytoplankton","Phytoplankton","Primary_production","Zooplankton","Zooplankton","Photosynthetic","Aquaculture","Eutrophication","Snails","Mollusks","Detritus","Biosolids","Biofilm","Colloid","Extinction","Gills","Ocean_Arks_International","Trophic_level","Predation","Flowers","Fish","Tomatoes","Lettuce","Hydroponic","Alaska","Ecological_engineering","Wastewater_treatment","Developing_countries","San_Francisco_Public_Utilities_Commission","Port_of_Portland","Furman_University","Old_Trail_School","Esalen_Institute","Northern_Guilford_Middle_School","Missouri_Department_of_Conservation","Oberlin_College","Berea_College","South_Burlington","BedZED","Findhorn","Ohio_State_University","Conserve_School","Land_O'_Lakes,_Wisconsin","Darrow_School","EVA_Lanxmeer","Bioremediation","Rain_garden","Anaerobic_digestion","Constructed_wetlands","Biomimicry"]}
