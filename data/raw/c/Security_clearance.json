The term \"security clearance\" is also\nsometimes used in private organizations that have a formal process to vet\nemployees for access to sensitive information. A clearance by itself is normally\nnot sufficient to gain access; the organization must determine that the cleared\nindividual needs to know the information. No one is supposed to be granted\naccess to classified information solely because of rank, position, or a security\nclearance.\n","linknr":357,"url":"Security_clearance","recorded":1362897206,"links":29,"instances":["intelligence"],"pdf":["http://eisen-shapiro.com/WebMaterials/52002r.pdf","http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf","http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/doha/policyinterpmemo.pdf","http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/doha/policyinterpmemo.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/nsa-interview.pdf","http://www.clearancejobs.com/security_clearance_faq.pdf"],"categories":["Espionage","National security","United States government secrecy","United Nations legislation"],"headings":["Canada","United Kingdom","United States","United Nations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["compartmentalization","intelligence"],["compartmentalization","intelligence"]],"members":["compartmentalization"],"related":["Classified_information","Secret","Background_check","Vetting","Need_to_know","Treasury_Board","Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police","Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service","Public_Works_and_Government_Services_Canada","Order-in-council","Need_to_know","Need_to_know","Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service","Government_Houses_of_Canada","List_of_Canadian_nuclear_facilities","2010_Winter_Olympics","Acts_of_Parliament","Criminal_Code_of_Canada","Official_Secrets_Act","United_States","President_of_the_United_States","National_Agency_Check_with_Local_Agency_Check_and_Credit_Check","Military_intelligence","Military_intelligence","Single_Scope_Background_Investigation","National_security","Counterterrorism","Counterintelligence","Defense_Security_Service","United_States_Office_of_Personnel_Management","Sensitive_Compartmented_Information","Single_Scope_Background_Investigation","Compartmentalization_(intelligence)","Read_into","SIGINT","Nuclear_weapons","National_Security_Agency","COMINT","Stealth_technology","L_clearance","Q_clearance","Yankee_White","Janitor","Vetting","Fingerprint","E-qip","E-qip","E-qip","National_Agency_Check_with_Local_Agency_Check_and_Credit_Check","Background_check","Single_Scope_Background_Investigation","Polygraph","Credit_check","Felony","Mental_health","Presidential_transition","Non-disclosure_agreement","Form_SF-312","Dual_citizenship","Passport","United_States_Department_of_Defense","World_War_II","Sandy_Berger","John_M._Deutch","Abdel-Moniem_El-Ganayni","Wen_Ho_Lee","Robert_Oppenheimer","Alan_Turing","United_Kingdom","United_Nations","Security_phase","United_Nations","Department_for_Safety_and_Security","Background_check","Compartmentalization_(intelligence)","List_of_U.S._security_clearance_terms","Security_Advisory_Opinion"]}
