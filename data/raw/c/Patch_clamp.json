{"cursor":"13547","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'patch clamp technique' is a laboratory technique in electrophysiology that\nallows the study of single or multiple ion channels in cells. The technique can\nbe applied to a wide variety of cells, but is especially useful in the study of\nexcitable cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, muscle fibers and pancreatic\nbeta cells. It can also be applied to the study of bacterial ion channels in\nspecially prepared giant spheroplasts.\n\nThe patch clamp technique is a refinement of the voltage clamp. Erwin Neher and\nBert Sakmann developed the patch clamp in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This\ndiscovery made it possible to record the currents of single ion channels for the\nfirst time, proving their involvement in fundamental cell processes such as\naction potential conduction. Neher and Sakmann received the Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology or Medicine in 1991 for this work.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Patch_clamp","recorded":1362509735,"links":27,"instances":["biochemistry","cell_biology","biology","unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neurophysiology","Physiology","Electrophysiology","Laboratory techniques"],"headings":["Basic technique","Variations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Patch_Clamp_Rig_classic.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Single_channel.png/270px-Single_channel.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Patch_clamp.svg/250px-Patch_clamp.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Patchclamp_Spheroplast1.jpg/220px-Patchclamp_Spheroplast1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Patchmodes.svg/260px-Patchmodes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/WholeCellPatchClamp-03.jpg/220px-WholeCellPatchClamp-03.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Neuro_logo.png/32px-Neuro_logo.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["ohm","unit"],["receptor","biochemistry#metabotropic_receptors"],["dialysis","biochemistry"],["bleb","cell_biology"],["voltage_clamp#continuous_single-electrode_clamp","sev-c"]],"members":["dialysis","receptor","bleb","cell","ohm"],"related":["Laboratory_technique","Electrophysiology","Ion_channel","Cell_(biology)","Neuron","Cardiomyocyte","Muscle_fiber","Pancreas","Beta_cell","Spheroplasts","Voltage_clamp","Erwin_Neher","Bert_Sakmann","Ion_channel","Action_potential","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Electrode","Micropipette","Micrometer","Plasma_membrane","Cell_membrane","Electrical_resistance","Cytoplasm","Ohm_(unit)","Electronic_noise","Voltage_clamp","Differential_amplifier","Electric_current","Membrane_potential","Ligand-gated_ion_channels","Neurotransmitter","Dose-response_relationship","Voltage-gated_ion_channel","Ohm's_law","Intracellular","Second_messenger_system","Dialysis_(biochemistry)","Bleb_(cell_biology)","Extracellular","Amphothericin-B","Nystatin","Gramicidin","Automated_patch_clamp","Microfluidics","Injection_molding","Polydimethylsiloxane","Bioelectronics","Cable_theory","Channelome","Channelomics","GHK_flux_equation","Goldman_equation","Multielectrode_array","Slice_preparation"]}
