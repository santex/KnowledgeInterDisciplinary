All\ntypes of VHF are characterized by fever and bleeding disorders and all can\nprogress to high fever, shock and death in many cases. Some of the VHF agents\ncause relatively mild illnesses, such as the Scandinavian [[nephropathia\nepidemica]], while others, such as the African Ebola virus, can cause severe,\nlife-threatening disease.\n","linknr":521,"url":"Viral_hemorrhagic_fever","recorded":1362501553,"links":76,"instances":["united_states"],"pdf":["http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf","http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%206th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202006.pdf","http://usmex.ucsd.edu/assets/022/10129.pdf","http://www.earthmatrix.com/linguistic/cocolitzli.pdf","http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/62/6/733.pdf","http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/62/6/733.pdf"],"categories":["Hemorrhagic fevers"],"headings":["Etiologic agents","Clinical and treatment aspects","Pathophysiology","Biowarfare/bioterrorism potential","Notable VHF outbreaks","See also","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/7042_lores-Ebola-Zaire-CDC_Photo.jpg/230px-7042_lores-Ebola-Zaire-CDC_Photo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"]],"members":["food_and_drug_administration"],"related":["RNA_virus","Ebola_virus","Arenaviridae","Lassa_fever","Lujo_virus","Argentine_hemorrhagic_fever","Bolivian_hemorrhagic_fever","Brazilian_hemorrhagic_fever","Venezuelan_hemorrhagic_fever","Bunyaviridae","Hemorrhagic_fever_with_renal_syndrome","Crimean-Congo_hemorrhagic_fever","Garissa_virus","Rift_Valley_fever","Filoviridae","Ebola_virus","Marburg_virus","Flaviviridae","Dengue","Yellow_fever","Tick-borne_encephalitis","Omsk_hemorrhagic_fever","Kyasanur_Forest_disease","PLOS_Pathogens","Rhabdoviridae","Fever","Bleeding_diathesis","Petechiae","Edema","Hypotension","Myalgia","Biocontainment","Lymphocyte","Platelet","Blood_serum","Liver","Enzyme","Ribavirin","Investigational_new_drug","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","Nosocomial","Dengue_hemorrhagic_fever","Antibody_dependent_enhancement","Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation","Biological_weapon","Yellow_Fever_Epidemic_of_1793","Mékambo","Gabon","Ebola_virus","Orientale_Province","Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Durba,_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Watsa","Marburg_virus","Uíge_Province","Angola","Epidemic","Mweka,_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo","Ebola_virus","Black_Death","Middle_Ages","Bubonic_plague","Plague_of_Athens","Peloponnesian_War","Lujo_virus","Biological_agent","Biopreparat","Bioterrorism","Fever","List_of_viruses","Matthew_Lukwiya","C.J._Peters"]}
