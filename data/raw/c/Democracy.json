{"cursor":"89857","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n:For the use of the term \"democracy\" as referring to a system involving\nmultiparty elections, representative government, and freedom of speech, see\n[[Liberal democracy]]. For other uses, see [[Democracy (disambiguation)]].\n\n\n\n\n\n'Democracy' is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal\nsay in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy allows eligible citizens\nto participate equally—either directly or through elected\nrepresentatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. It\nencompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and\nequal practice of political self-determination.\n\nThe term originates from the Greek ({{lang|grc-Latn|dÄmokratÃ­a}}) \"rule of the\npeople\", [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A199-\n9.04.0058%3Aentry%3Ddhmokrati%2Fa Î´Î·Î¼Î¿ÎºÏÎ±ÏÎ¯Î±] in Henry George Liddell, Robert\nScott, \"A Greek-English Lexicon\", at Perseus which was coined from Î´á¿Î¼Î¿Ï\n(dÃªmos) \"people\" and ÎºÏÎ¬ÏÎ¿Ï (kratos) \"power\" in the 5th century BCE to denote\nthe political systems then existing in Greek city-states, notably Athens; the\nterm is an antonym to (aristocratie) \"rule of an elite.\" While theoretically\nthese definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been\nblurred historically. Wilson, N. G. (2006). Encyclopedia of ancient Greece.\nNew York: Routledge. p. 511. ISBN 0415973341. The political system of\nClassical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class\nof free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In\nvirtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history,\ndemocratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement\nwas won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage\nmovements of the 19th and 20th centuries. The English word dates to the 16th\ncentury, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents.\n\nA democratic government contrasts to forms of government where power is either\nheld by one, as in a monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of\nindividuals, as in an oligarchy. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from\nGreek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments\nhave mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. Karl Popper defined\ndemocracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities\nfor the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a\nrevolution. Jarvie, 2006, pp. 218-9\n\nSeveral variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of\nwhich concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One\nform of democracy is direct democracy, in which all eligible citizens have\ndirect and active participation in the decision making of the government. In\nmost modern democracies, the whole body of all eligible citizens remain the\nsovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected\nrepresentatives; this is called representative democracy. The concept of\nrepresentative democracy arose largely from ideas and institutions that\ndeveloped during the European Middle Ages, the Age of Enlightenment, and the\nAmerican and French\nRevolutions. \"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/157129/democracy\nDemocracy]\".
