{"cursor":"4327","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'Brunton compass', properly known as the 'Brunton Pocket Transit', is a type\nof precision compass made by Brunton, Inc. of Riverton, Wyoming. The instrument\nwas patented in 1894 by a Canadian-born Colorado geologist named David W.\nBrunton. Unlike most modern compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit utilizes\nmagnetic induction damping rather than fluid to damp needle oscillation.\nAlthough Brunton Inc. makes many other types of magnetic compasses, the Brunton\nPocket Transit is a specialized instrument used widely by those needing to make\naccurate degree and angle measurements in the field. These people are primarily\ngeologists, but archaeologists, environmental engineers, and surveyors also make\nuse of the Brunton's capabilities. The United States Army has adopted the Pocket\nTransit as the M2 Compass for use by crew-served artillery.\n\nThe Pocket Transit may be adjusted for declination angle according to one's\nlocation on the Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements\n(azimuth) through use of the Earth's magnetic field. Holding the compass at waist-\nheight, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and\nguide line that is on the mirror. Once all three are lined up and the compass is\nlevel, the reading for that azimuth can be made. Arguably the most frequent use\nfor the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the strike and dip of\ngeological features (faults, contacts, foliation, sedimentary strata, etc.). If\nnext to the feature, the strike is measured by leveling (with the bull's eye\nlevel) the compass along the plane being measured. Dip is taken by laying the\nside of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating\nhorizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made. If\nproperly used and if field conditions allow, additional features of the compass\nallow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance.\n\nAs with most traditional compasses, directional measurements are made in\nreference to the Earth's magnetic field and will thus run into difficulties if\nin a region of locally abnormal magnetism. For example, if the user is near an\noutcrop that contains magnetite or some other iron-bearing material, compass\nreadings can be affected anywhere from several inches from the outcrop to tens\nof yards away (depending on the strength of the magnetic field). Since they are\nmeasured only using a rotating level, dip measurements are unaffected by\nmagnetic fields.\n\nThere are numerous other compasses used by geologists, for example a Breithaupt\ncompass (http://www.breithaupt.de/). This is commonly used by structural\ngeologists because it readily allows accurate measurement of the orientation of\nplanes (foliations) and of lines on those planes (lineations). With the advent\nof portable electronic devices such as the iPhone, a new generation of compasses\nhas emerged, some again of specific interest to geologists (e.g.\nhttp://geologyCompass.com/). The listerCompass (designed by structural geologist\nProfessor Gordon Lister) allows a single measurement that simultaneously records\nstrike, dip, as well as the rake of a lineation on a foliation plane.\nAlternatively with the focus on lineations, an option that allows measurement of\nyaw, pitch, and roll (the same as involved in the motion of an aircraft) may\nachieve the same objective. Unlike analogue compasses, a digital compass relies\non an accelerometer and a teslameter, and may provide much information as to the\nreliability of a measurement (e.g. by repeating the same measurement and\nperforming statistical analysis).\n","linknr":106,"url":"Brunton_compass","recorded":1363572651,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Brunton.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Brunton.JPG/300px-Brunton.JPG","/wiki/File:Brunton.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Compass","/wiki/Brunton,_Inc.","/wiki/Riverton,_WY","/wiki/Wyoming","/wiki/Magnetic_damping","/wiki/Geologist","/wiki/Archaeologist","/wiki/Environmental_engineer","/wiki/Surveying","/wiki/United_States_Army","/wiki/Artillery","/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field","/wiki/Azimuth","/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field","/wiki/Strike_and_dip","/wiki/Geology","/wiki/Fault_(geology)","/wiki/Foliation","/wiki/Stratum","/wiki/Bull%27s_eye_level","/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field","/wiki/Magnetism","/wiki/Magnetite","/wiki/Iron","/wiki/Outcrop","/wiki/Spirit_level","http://www.breithaupt.de/","http://geologyCompass.com/","/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&action=edit&section=1","http://www.kooters.com/sezbrntn.html","http://www.brunton.com","http://www2.gsu.edu/~geohab/Babaie/pages/geol4009/bruntonCompass.htm","http://earthsci.org/education/fieldsk/compass/compass.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&oldid=544312035","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Structural_geology","/wiki/Category:Surveying","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brunton+compass&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Brunton+compass","/wiki/Brunton_compass","/wiki/Talk:Brunton_compass","#","/wiki/Brunton_compass","/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Brunton_compass","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Brunton_compass","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&oldid=544312035","/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Brunton_compass&id=544312035","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Brunton+compass","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Brunton+compass&oldid=544312035&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Brunton_compass&printable=yes","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BAixola_Brunton","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BAjula_Brunton","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Brunton
