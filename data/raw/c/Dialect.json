{"cursor":"22763","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe term 'dialect' (from the ancient Greek word ÎÎ¹Î¬Î»ÎµÎºÏÎ¿Ï diÃ¡lektos,\n\"discourse\", from diÃ¡, \"through\" + legÅ, \"I speak\") is used in two distinct\nways, even by linguists. One usage refers to a variety of a language that is a\ncharacteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers. [http://di-\nctionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&queryword=dialect&first=1&m-\nax_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-\n18775&hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.] The term is applied most\noften to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other\nfactors, such as social class. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dialect Merriam-\nWebster Online dictionary.] A dialect that is associated with a particular\nsocial class can be termed a sociolect and a regional dialect may be termed a\nregiolect or topolect. The other usage refers to a language that is socially\nsubordinate to a regional or national standard language, often historically\ncognate to the standard, but not a variety of it or in any other sense derived\nfrom it. An example of the overlap of these is the historical Romance language\nof the County of Nice, located in modern day France. NiÃ§ard is a distinct\nsubdialect of the Occitan language (ProvenÃ§al dialect). NiÃ§ard is a language\nalso spoken in Monaco, Calabria Italy, and Catalonia Spain, where it is an\nofficial language Aranese. Along with Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian and\nSardinian, the Occitan language is a descendant of the spoken Latin language of\nthe Roman Empire. Some authors, like Francesco Barberis, believe original\nNissart was more closely related to the Gallo-Italian languages (Ligurian) than\nto the Occitan, until this was annexed to France in 1860.\n\nA framework was developed in 1967 by Heinz Kloss, Ausbau-, Abstand- and Dach-\nsprache, to describe speech communities, that while unified politically and/or\nculturally, include multiple dialects which though closely related genetically\nmay be divergent to the point of inter-dialect unintelligibility.\n\nA dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation\n(phonology, including prosody). Where a distinction can be made only in terms\nof pronunciation, the term [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] is appropriate, not\ndialect. Other speech varieties include: standard languages, which are\nstandardized for public performance (for example, a written standard); jargons,\nwhich are characterized by differences in lexicon (vocabulary); slang; patois;\npidgins or argots.\n\nThe particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an idiolect.\n","linknr":451,"url":"Dialect","recorded":1362480895,"links":109,"instances":["linguistics","dialect","dialect","linguistics","romance_language","dialect","polity","sociolinguistics","linguist","linguistics","language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dialects|","Language","Language varieties and styles","Lexicology"],"headings":["Standard and non-standard dialect","Dialect or Language","Political factors","Historical linguistics","Selected list of articles on dialects","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["variety","linguistics"],["ligurian","romance_language"],["prosody","linguistics"],["joseph_wright","linguist"],["german","language"],["codification","linguistics"],["state","polity"],["shirazi","dialect"],["yazdi","dialect"],["accent","dialect"],["register","sociolinguistics"]],"members":["variety","shirazi","yazdi","prosody","ligurian","accent","state","register","joseph_wright","codification","german"],"related":["Ancient_Greek","Linguists","Variety_(linguistics)","Language","Social_class","Sociolect","Cognate","County_of_Nice","France","Niçard","Subdialect","Occitan_language","Provençal_dialect","Calabria","Catalonia","Aranese","Roman_Empire","Gallo-Italian_languages","Ligurian_(Romance_language)","Heinz_Kloss","Ausbausprache,_Abstandsprache_and_Dachsprache_","Phonology","Prosody_(linguistics)","Standard_language","Jargon","Lexicon","Vocabulary","Slang","Patois","Pidgin","Argot","Idiolect","American_English","Canadian_English","Indian_English","Australian_English","Philippine_English","English_language","Hong_Kong_Special_Administrative_Region","Putonghua","Language_proficiency","English_language","Nonstandard_dialect","Southern_American_English","Newfoundland_English","Dialect_Test","Joseph_Wright_(linguist)","Pennsylvania_Dutch","German_(language)","Codification_(linguistics)","State_(polity)","Prestige_dialect","Anthropological_linguistics","Speech_community","Elite","Social_status","Romansh_language","Chinese_language","Mandarin_Chinese","Yue_Chinese","Nationalism","French_Revolution","Yiddish_language","Max_Weinreich","A_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy","New_High_German","Ausgleichssprache","Nation_building","German_dialectology","Slavic_languages","Frisian_languages","Dutch_language","Danish_language","Tsar","Russia","Ukrainian_language","Russian_language","Serbo-Croatian_language","British_English","Serbian_language","Croatian_language","Serbia","Croatia","Macedonian_language","Bulgarian_language","South_Slavic_languages","Dialect_continuum","Republic_of_Macedonia","Lebanon","Guardians_of_the_Cedars","Arab","Lebanese_language","Arabic_language","Arabic_alphabet","Phoenician_alphabet","Varieties_of_Arabic","North_Africa","Maghreb","Middle_East","Mashriq","Egypt","Sudan","Arab_Nationalism","Literary_Arabic","Islam","Liturgical_language","Qur'an","Illinois","Official_language","Moldovan_language","President_of_Moldova","Mircea_Snegur","Moldovan–Romanian_dictionary","Romanian_Academy","Academy_of_Sciences_of_Moldova","Spoken_Chinese","Han_Chinese","Commission_on_the_Filipino_Language","Historical_linguistics","Romance_languages","Latin","Greek_language","Tok_Pisin","Scandinavian_languages","Old_Norse","Italian_language","Spanish_language","French_language","Interlingua","Interlingua_and_eligibility_of_international_words","Alice_Vanderbilt_Morris","International_scientific_vocabulary","Standard_Average_European","International_Auxiliary_Language_Association","Alexander_Gode","Interlingua-English_Dictionary","Varieties_of_Arabic","Bengali_dialects","Catalan_dialect_examples","Connacht_Irish","Munster_Irish","Ulster_Irish","Cypriot_Greek","Cypriot_Turkish","Danish_dialects","Dialect_of_Chalkidiki","Dialects_in_Serbia,_Croatia_and_Bosnia","Dialects_of_the_French_language","Dutch_dialects","German_dialects","Isfahani","Shirazi_(dialect)","Yazdi_(dialect)","Italian_dialects","Japanese_dialects","Korean_dialects","List_of_Assyrian_tribes","List_of_Chinese_dialects","List_of_dialects_of_the_English_language","Norwegian_dialects","Portuguese_dialects","Rauma_dialect","Finnish_language","Sicilian_language","Slovenian_dialects","Spanish_dialects_and_varieties","Sri_Lankan_Tamil_dialects","Swedish_dialects","Warsaw_dialect","Polish_language","Yiddish_dialects","Nahuatl_dialects","Accent_(dialect)","Creole_language","Dialect_levelling","Dialectometry","Ethnolect","Isogloss","Koiné_language","Register_(sociolinguistics)","Literary_language","Nation_language","Regional_language","Sprachbund"]}
