The site currently houses the\nBletchley Park Museum, the National Museum of Computing, tenanted office space\nand a number of other attractions.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bletchley Park was the site of the United Kingdom's\nmain decryption establishment, the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS),\nwhere ciphers and codes of several Axis countries were decrypted, most\nimportantly the ciphers generated by the German Enigma and Lorenz machines. It\nalso housed a secret radio intercept station, and also a message sending\nstation, although interception was soon moved to a location with better\nreception. \"Station X\", \"London Signals Intelligence Centre\" and \"Government\nCommunications Headquarters\" were all cover names that were used during the war,\nand the latter (GCHQ) was adopted for the successor peacetime organisation that\nstill bears this name. For the many members of the Women's Royal\nNaval Service (Wrens) who worked at Bletchley Park, their posting was to HMS\nPembroke V.\n\nThe high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra,\nprovided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort. Sir Harry Hinsley, a\nBletchley veteran and the official historian of British Intelligence during the\nSecond World War, said that Ultra shortened the war by two to four years and\nthat the outcome of the war would have been uncertain without it.\n\nThe site is now controlled by the Bletchley Park Trust. One of its tenants is a\ncompany called the Bletchley Park Science and Innovation Centre (BPSIC), which\nprovides rental income for the Trust by providing office space and services to\ninnovative, early stage companies. The BPSIC refurbished\nsome of the historic structures and occupies part of the former code-breaker\nbuildings. The National Museum of Computing,\nan independent voluntary organisation, rents space from the Trust to house its\ncollection of historic computers. The museum is run by the Codes and Ciphers\nHeritage Trust (an independent registered charity) and is open to the public. It\nreceives no Government or regional funding.\n\nSince 1967, Bletchley has been part of the town, and subsequently borough, of\nMilton Keynes.\n","linknr":967,"url":"Bletchley_Park","recorded":1362902182,"links":60,"instances":["cipher_machine","cryptography","newspaper_reporter","united_kingdom","language","cipher_machine","uk","great_britain","computer_scientist","2001_film"],"pdf":["http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/imported-docs/p-t/thehistoryofthemansionbletchleypark.pdf","http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/content/imported-docs/p-t/thehistoryofthemansionbletchleypark.pdf","http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf","http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf","http://www.ams.org/online_bks/hmath1/hmath1-hilton22.pdf","http://www.ams.org/online_bks/hmath1/hmath1-hilton22.pdf"],"categories":["Organizations
