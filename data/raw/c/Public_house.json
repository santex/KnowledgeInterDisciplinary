Newfoundland,\nCanada and New Zealand. In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the\nfocal point of the community. The writings of Samuel Pepys describe the pub as\nthe heart of England.\n\nThe history of pubs can be traced back to Roman taverns, through the Anglo-Saxon alehouse to the development of the modern tied\nhouse system in the 19th century.\n\nHistorically, pubs have been socially and culturally distinct from cafÃ©s, bars,\nbierkellers and brewpubs. Most pubs offer a range of beers, wines, spirits, and\nsoft drinks. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so cask ale or keg beer may\nbe a better value than wines and spirits. Traditionally the windows of town pubs\nwere of smoked or frosted glass to obscure the clientele from the street but in\nthe 1990s and after in the UK and other countries there has been a move towards\nclear glass, in keeping with brighter interior dÃ©cors.\n\nThe owner, tenant or manager (licensee) of a pub is properly known as the\n\"pub landlord\". The term publican (in historical Roman usage a public\ncontractor or tax farmer) has come into use since Victorian times to\ndesignate the pub landlord. Known as \"locals\" to regulars, pubs are typically\nchosen for their proximity to work, the availability of a particular beer, as\na place to smoke (or avoid it), hosting a darts team, having a pool table, or\nappealing to friends.\n\nUntil the 1970s most of the larger pubs also featured an off-sales counter or\nattached shop for the sales of beers, wines and spirits for home consumption. In\nthe 1970s the newly built supermarkets and high street chain stores or off-\nlicences undercut the pub prices to such a degree that within ten years all but\na handful of pubs had closed their off-sale counters.\n","linknr":1278,"url":"Public_house","recorded":1362574101,"links":75,"instances":["pub","british_coin","bury_st_edmunds_pub","london_street","entertainer","english_law","law","beer","oxford","sport","pool","economics","pub","bivalve","uk","island","public_house","public_house"],"pdf":["http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/bsc/pdfs/research/soap.pdf"],"categories":["Bartending","Public
