{"cursor":"3106","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n[[File:Cultivated phototrophic biofilm.jpg|thumb|Phototrophic biofilm cultivated\nin a lab]] ]]\n\n'Phototrophic biofilms' occur on contact surfaces in a range of terrestrial and\naquatic environments. Phototrophic biofilms can best be described as surface\nattached microbial communities (see also Biofilm and Chemistry of Biofilm\nPrevention) mainly driven by light as the energy source with phototrophic\norganisms clearly present. Eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria generate energy\nand reduce carbon dioxide, providing organic substrates and oxygen. The\nphotosynthetic activity fuels processes and conversions in the total biofilm\ncommunity, including the heterotrophic fraction.\n\nThick laminated multilayered phototrophic biofilms are usually referred to as\nmicrobial mats or phototrophic mats (see also biofilm). Phototrophic biofilms\nand microbial mats have been described in extreme environments like thermal\nsprings, hyper saline ponds, desert soil crusts, and in\nlake ice covers in Antarctica. The 3.4-billion-year fossil record of benthic\nphototrophic communities, such as microbial mats and stromatolites, indicates\nthat these associations represent the Earth's oldest known ecosystems. It is\nthought that these early ecosystems played a key role in the build-up of oxygen\nin the Earthâs atmosphere.\n\nThere is a growing interest in the application of phototrophic biofilms, for\ninstance in wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands, bioremediation,\naquaculture, and biohydrogen production.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Phototrophic_biofilms","recorded":1362511602,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteria","Cyanobacteria","Environmental microbiology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Merge-arrow.svg/50px-Merge-arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/Cultivated_phototrophic_biofilm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/86/Microbial_mat_section.jpg/220px-Microbial_mat_section.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biofilm","Chemistry_of_Biofilm_Prevention","Phototrophic","Algae","Cyanobacteria","Oxygen","Photosynthetic","Heterotrophic","Microbial_mat","Biofilm","Benthic","Stromatolites","Oxygen","Earth’s_atmosphere","Constructed_wetlands","Bioremediation","Aquaculture","Biohydrogen"]}
