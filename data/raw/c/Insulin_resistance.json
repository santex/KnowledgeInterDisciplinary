Insulin's job is to\ndeliver sugar to cells to provide them with energy. Cells are not\nable to take in glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. Thus, glucose, fatty acids\nand amino acids 'leak' out of the cells. A decrease in insulin/glucagon ratio\ninhibits glycolysis which in turn decreases energy production. The resulting\nincrease in blood glucose may raise levels outside the normal range and cause\nadverse health effects, depending on dietary conditions. Certain cell\ntypes such as fat and muscle cells require insulin to absorb glucose. When these\ncells fail to respond adequately to circulating insulin, blood glucose levels\nrise. The liver helps regulate glucose levels by reducing its secretion of\nglucose in the presence of insulin. This normal reduction in the liverâs glucose\nproduction may not occur in people with insulin resistance.\n\nInsulin resistance in muscle and fat cells reduces glucose uptake (and also\nlocal storage of glucose as glycogen and triglycerides, respectively), whereas\ninsulin resistance in liver cells results in reduced glycogen synthesis and\nstorage and a failure to suppress glucose production and release into the blood.\nInsulin resistance normally refers to reduced glucose-lowering effects of\ninsulin. However, other functions of insulin can also be affected. For example,\ninsulin resistance in fat cells reduces the normal effects of insulin on lipids\nand results in reduced uptake of circulating lipids and increased hydrolysis of\nstored triglycerides. Increased mobilization of stored lipids in these cells\nelevates free fatty acids in the blood plasma. Elevated blood fatty-acid\nconcentrations (associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus Type\n2), reduced muscle glucose uptake, and increased liver glucose production all\ncontribute to elevated blood glucose levels. High plasma levels of insulin and\nglucose due to insulin resistance are a major component of the metabolic\nsyndrome. If insulin resistance exists, more insulin needs to be secreted by the\npancreas. If this compensatory increase does not occur, blood glucose\nconcentrations increase and type 2 diabetes occurs.\n","linknr":1126,"url":"Insulin_resistance","recorded":1362485026,"links":57,"instances":["test","biology"],"pdf":["http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/dspace/bitstream/10113/30297/1/IND44194772.pdf","http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/dspace/bitstream/10113/30297/1/IND44194772.pdf","http://ijch.fi/issues/644/644_Ebbesson_4.pdf","http://ijch.fi/issues/644/644_Ebbesson_4.pdf","http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Energy/422-541.pdf","http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Energy/422-541.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/49/6/1155.full.pdf","http://www.ajcn.org/content/49/6/1155.full.pdf","http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/10/5/512.pdf","http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/10/5/512.pdf","http://leptinresearch.org/pdf/rsh_leptin_resistance_and_obesity.pdf","http://leptinresearch.org/pdf/rsh_leptin_resistance_and_obesity.pdf","http://www.uoguelph.ca/hhns/grad/courses/HHNS6700F10WeeklyReadings/UngerandScherer.pdf","http://www.uoguelph.ca/hhns/grad/courses/HHNS6700F10WeeklyReadings/UngerandScherer.pdf","http://www.healthinsight.co.za/Dietary%20Fats,%20Fatty%20Acids%20and%20IR%20-%20Haag,%20Dippenaar.pdf","http://www.healthinsight.co.za/Dietary%20Fats,%20Fatty%20Acids%20and%20IR%20-%20Haag,%20Dippenaar.pdf","http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/11/2579.full.pdf","http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/11/2579.full.pdf","http://www.ysonut.es/pdf/Ysodoc/D060302.pdf","http://www.ysonut.es/pdf/Ysodoc/D060302.pdf"],"categories":["Diabetes"],"headings":["Signs and symptoms","Causes","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis","Management","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["gold_standard","test"]],"members":["gold_standard","cell"],"related":["Physiological","Insulin","Fat","Muscle","Cell_(biology)","Liver","Glucose","Glycogen","Triglycerides","Adipose_tissue","Hydrolysis","Triglyceride","Fatty_acid","Blood_plasma","Metabolic_syndrome","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Acanthosis_nigricans","Insulin_receptor","Donohue_Syndrome","LMNA","Familial_partial_lipodystrophy","Obesity","Triglyceride","Hypertriglyceridemia","High-density_lipoprotein","Hepatitis_C","Haemochromatosis","Gastroparesis","Polycystic_ovary_syndrome","Hypercortisolism","Steroid","Cushing's_disease","Medication","Glucosamine","Rifampicin","Isoniazid","Olanzapine","Risperidone","Progestogen","Corticosteroid","Glucocorticoid","Methadone","Antiretroviral","Obesity","Omega-3","Eicosapentaenoic_acid","Docosahexaenoic_acid","Alpha-Linolenic_acid","Free_fatty_acid","Triglyceride","Trans_fat","VLDL","Fructose","Palmitate","Leptin","Low-carb","Potato","Pumpernickel","Glycemic_index","Fat_cells","Adipose_cells","Fast_food","Glucosamine","Cortisol","Vitamin_D","Protease_inhibitors","Phospholipid","Cell_membranes","Insulin","Gluconeogenesis","Glucose_transporter","GLUT4","C-Jun_N-terminal_kinases","Superoxide_dismutase","Mitochondria","Uncoupling_protein","Electron_transport_chain","Bariatric_surgery","Duodenum","PCOS","Sucrose","Starch","Blood_glucose_level","Islets_of_Langerhans","Pancreas","Muscle","Adipose","Liver","Glucose","Reference_ranges_for_blood_tests","Insulin","Insulin","Metabolic_syndrome","T2DM","Hyperglycemia","Euglycemia","T2DM","Infection","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Acidosis","Adipokine","Cytokine","Adipose_tissue","Glucocorticoid","GLUT4","Glycation","Protein","Dyslipidemia","Cytokines","TNF-a","Interleukins","NF-kappa-B","T2DM","Hypercoagulable_state","Fibrinolysis","Magnesium","T2DM","T2DM","T2DM","T2DM","Glucose_tolerance_test","Glycemia","Impaired_glucose_tolerance","Diabetes_mellitus","Hypoglycemia","Gold_standard_(test)","Glucose","Insulin","Hypoglycemia","Glucose_clamp_technique","Peripheral_vein","Insulin","Minute","Intravenous","Glucose","Blood_sugar","Hypoglycemia","Homeostatic_model_assessment","Quantitative_insulin_sensitivity_check_index","Fasting","Insulin","Glucose","Logarithm","Exercise","Weight_loss","Glycemic_load","Metformin","Thiazolidinedione","Growth_hormone_treatment","Exenatide","Metformin","Monounsaturated_fat","Polyunsaturated_fat","Omega-3","Diabetes_mellitus","Harold_Percival_Himsworth","Chronic_Somogyi_rebound","Hyperinsulinemia","Resistin","Chronic_stress","Advanced_glycation_end-products","Open_Directory_Project"]}
