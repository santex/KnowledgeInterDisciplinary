{"cursor":"22275","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton.\nThere are very few 'strong acids'. A strong acid is one that completely ionizes\n(dissociates) in water; in other words, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves\nin water yielding one mole of H + and one mole of the conjugate base,\nA â . Essentially none of the non-ionized acid HA remains. In contrast\na weak acid only partially dissociates, and at equilibrium both the acid and the\nconjugate base are present in solution. Examples of strong acids are\nhydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr),\nperchloric acid (HClO 4), nitric acid (HNO 3) and sulfuric\nacid (H 2SO 4). In water each of these essentially ionizes\n100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H +.\nTwo key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of\nthe HâA bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the HâA\nbond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the\nconjugate base.\n\nStronger acids have a larger K a and a more negative pK a\nthan weaker acids.\n\nSulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A\ncommon example is toluenesulfonic acid (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid\nitself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, polystyrene functionalized into\npolystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.\n\nSuperacids are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids\nare fluoroantimonic acid, magic acid and perchloric acid. Superacids can\npermanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline hydronium \"salts\". They\ncan also quantitatively stabilize carbocations.\n","linknr":351,"url":"Weak_acid","recorded":1362372423,"links":38,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":["http://www2.lsdiv.harvard.edu/labs/evans/pdf/evans_pKa_table.pdf","http://research.chem.psu.edu/brpgroup/pKa_compilation.pdf"],"categories":["Acids"],"headings":["Strong acids","Weak acids","Factors determining acid strength","Corrosivity","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/4/b/c4be43e592e20b8148a49a4d4a0ad059.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/1/e1160cb29e6e647fa04612aee2af4f35.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/a/0/2a02eca08939cca0b8b70efd4af2627a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/0/0/800618943025315f869e4e1f09471012.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/1/cb108e5afcbac4112ebe9a4f4f6cc9d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/1/cb108e5afcbac4112ebe9a4f4f6cc9d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/1/cb108e5afcbac4112ebe9a4f4f6cc9d4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/8/8/388d5ea566217a7057d3b0ffee09e6ea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/0/9/6091efa587e39500fd784fb6d234d10f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/1/051cb7ddf204b18468c0e2c11d82ac73.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/b/b/4bb2dd990393b55eab81e8276435eca6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/4/2/34277a501d15354196efc7b502569e36.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/9/a/39aecc76e6b9d021f78a3af185c1720c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/f/69f785895569d2095a8eb2e6143a3c99.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/9/5/99524dd528420fa74f51e3e1b21aa919.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/3/5/03597d21a394ce42a1d9f048d3b5c7f6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/5/d552f13f436f6279c5d8c888581c0e5a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Butanoic.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/4chlorobutanoic.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/3chlorobutanoic.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/2bromobutanoic.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/2chlorobutanoic.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Perchloricacid.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Reduction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dissociation","chemistry#acids"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["mole","dissociation"],"related":["Acid","Mole_(unit)","Strong_acid","Hydrochloric_acid","Hydroiodic_acid","Hydrobromic_acid","Perchloric_acid","Nitric_acid","Sulfuric_acid","Chemical_polarity","Toluenesulfonic_acid","Polystyrene","Superacid","Fluoroantimonic_acid","Magic_acid","Perchloric_acid","Hydronium","Carbocation","Acid","Ionization","Aqueous_solution","Proton","Sulfuric_acid","Diprotic_acid","Hydronium","Acid_dissociation_constant","Hydrochloric_acid","Standard_temperature_and_pressure","Weak_acid","Acid_dissociation_constant","PH","Electronegativity","Conjugate_base","Hydroiodic_acid","Acid_dissociation_constant","Hydrobromic_acid","Perchloric_acid","Hydrochloric_acid","Sulfuric_acid","P-Toluenesulfonic_acid","Hydronium_ion","Nitric_acid","Chloric_acid","Bromic_acid","Perbromic_acid","Iodic_acid","Periodic_acid","Fluoroantimonic_acid","Magic_acid","Carborane_superacid","Fluorosulfuric_acid","Triflic_acid","Acid","Hydrogen","Proton","PKa","Strong_acids","Acetic_acid","Oxalic_acid","Ionization","Solution","Acid_dissociation_constant","PH","Chemical_bond","Electronegativity","Oxygen","Bromine","Electron_density","Periodic_table","Noble_gases","Binary_acid","Hydrofluoric_acid","Ammonia","Methane","Inductive_effect","Halogenated","Butanoic_acid","Chlorine","Bromine","Carboxylic_acid","Butanoic_acid","Butyric_acid","Butyric_acid","Oxoacid","Strong_acid","Oxoacid","Chlorine","Chloric_acid","Chlorous_acid","Hypochlorous_acid","Carboxylic_acid","Organic_acid","Hydroxyl_group","Carbonyl","Redox","Acetic_acid","Ethanol","Lithium_aluminium_hydride","Diethyl_ether","Chemical_bond","Bond_energy","Atomic_radius","Hydrogen_sulfide","Corrosive_substance","Carborane","Superacid","Sulfuric_acid","Hammett_acidity_function","Weak_acid","Hydrofluoric_acid","Titration_curves"]}
