{"cursor":"35395","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn statistics, 'statistical inference' is the process of drawing conclusions\nfrom data that is subject to random variation, for example, observational errors\nor sampling variation. Upton, G., Cook, I. (2008) Oxford\nDictionary of Statistics, OUP. ISBN 978-0-19-954145-4 More substantially,\nthe terms 'statistical inference', 'statistical induction' and 'inferential\nstatistics' are used to describe systems of procedures that can be used to draw\nconclusions from datasets arising from systems affected by random\nvariation, Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms, OUP.\nISBN 0-19-920613-9 (entry for \"inferential statistics\") such as\nobservational errors, random sampling, or random experimentation. Initial requirements of such a system of procedures for\ninference and induction are that the system should produce reasonable answers\nwhen applied to well-defined situations and that it should be general enough to\nbe applied across a range of situations.\n\nThe outcome of statistical inference may be an answer to the question \"what\nshould be done next?\", where this might be a decision about making further\nexperiments or surveys, or about drawing a conclusion before implementing some\norganizational or governmental policy.\n","linknr":761,"url":"Statistical_inference","recorded":1362484622,"links":44,"instances":["philosophy","statistics","statistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical inference|","Statistical
