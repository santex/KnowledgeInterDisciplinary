{"cursor":"50087","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Molecular [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]' ('MD') is a computer simulation\nof physical movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are\nallowed to interact for a period of time, giving a view of the motion of the\natoms. In the most common version, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are\ndetermined by numerically solving the Newton's equations of motion for a system\nof interacting particles, where forces between the particles and potential\nenergy are defined by molecular mechanics force fields. The method was\noriginally conceived within theoretical physics in the late 1950s  {{cite journal\n | first = B. J. last = Alder authorlink = coauthors = T. E.

However, long MD\nsimulations are mathematically ill-conditioned, generating cumulative errors in\nnumerical integration that can be minimized with proper selection of algorithms\nand parameters, but not eliminated entirely.\n\nThe results of molecular dynamics simulations may be used to determine\nmacroscopic thermodynamic properties of the system based on the ergodic\nhypothesis: the statistical ensemble averages are equal to time averages of the\nsystem. MD has also been termed \"statistical mechanics by numbers\" and\n\"Laplace's vision of Newtonian mechanics\" of predicting the future by animating\nnature's forces {{cite book\n | last = Schlick first = T. editor = J.
