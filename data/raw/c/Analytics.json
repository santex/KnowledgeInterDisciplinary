Analytics often favors data\n visualization to communicate insight.\n\nFirms may commonly apply analytics to business data, to describe, predict, and\nimprove business performance. Specifically, arenas within analytics include\nenterprise decision management, retail analytics, store assortment and SKU\noptimization, marketing optimization and marketing mix analytics, web analytics,\nsales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive\nscience, credit risk analysis, and fraud analytics. Since analytics can require\nextensive computation (See Big Data), the algorithms and software used for\nanalytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and\nmathematics.\n","linknr":180,"url":"Analytics","recorded":1362570787,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytics|","Financial data analysis","Mathematical finance","Formal sciences","Business terms","Business intelligence","Big Data"],"headings":["Analytics vs. analysis","Examples","Challenges","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Google_Analytics_Sample_Dashboard.jpg/220px-Google_Analytics_Sample_Dashboard.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["risk_analysis","business#"]],"members":["risk_analysis"],"related":["Statistics","Computer_programming","Operations_research","Data_visualization","Enterprise_decision_management","Web_analytics","Fraud_detection","Big_Data","Methodology","Text_analytics","Text_mining","Web_analytics","Marketing_mix_modeling","Portfolio_finance","Bank","Value_economics","Risk","Loan","Time_series","Big_data","Unstructured_data","Structured_data","Business_intelligence","Complex_event_processing","Analysis","Big_data","Business_analytics","Business_intelligence","Complex_event_processing","Data_mining","Data_presentation_architecture","Learning_analytics","List_of_software_engineering_topics","Machine_learning","Online_analytical_processing","Online_video_analytics","Operations_research","Predictive_analytics","Prescriptive_Analytics","Statistics","Web_analytics"]}
