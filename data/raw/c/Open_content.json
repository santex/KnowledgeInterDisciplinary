{"cursor":"13035","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Open content' or 'OpenContent' is a neologism coined by David Wiley in 1998 which describes a creative work that others can copy or\nmodify. The term evokes open source software, which is a related concept in\nsoftware. {{cite web\n| last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org|\n| accessdate = 2012-04-17| year = 1998| url =\n| http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/we-\n| b/19990128224600/http://www.opencontent.org/home.shtml| archivedate = 1999-01-\n| 28}}\n\nWhen the term OpenContent was first used by Wiley, it described works licensed\nunder the Open Content License (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free\ncontent' below) and perhaps other works licensed under similar terms. {{cite web\n| last = Wiley| first = David| title = Open Content| work = OpenContent.org|\n| accessdate = 2010-01-12| year = 1998| url = http://web.archive.org/web/199904-\n| 29221830/www.opencontent.org/home.shtml}} It has since come to describe\n| a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The\n| openness of content can be assessed under the '4Rs Framework' based on the\n| extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by\n| members of the public without violating copyright law. Unlike open source and free content, there is\n| no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.\n\nAlthough open content has been described as a counterbalance to\ncopyright, open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power\nto license their work.\n","linknr":338,"url":"Open_content","recorded":1362535054,"links":49,"instances":["publishing"],"pdf":["http://www.apdip.net/publications/fosseprimers/foss-opencontent-nocover.pdf","http://www.apdip.net/publications/fosseprimers/foss-opencontent-nocover.pdf","http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf","http://www.hewlett.org/uploads/files/Hewlett_OER_report.pdf"],"categories":["Open content|","Digital art"],"headings":["Definition","Free content and free documentation","Open access","Open Content and Education","Licenses","See also","References","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["open_access","publishing"]],"members":["open_access"],"related":["Neologism","David_A._Wiley","Creative_work","Open_source_software","Open_Content_License","Open_source","Free_content","Copyright","Open_Content_License","Open_educational_resources","Open_knowledge","Alternative_terms_for_free_software","Free_content","Free_Software_Foundation","Copyfree_Initiative","Copyfree","Open_access_(publishing)","Gratis","Peer_review","OpenCourseWare","The_Saylor_Foundation","Khan_Academy","MIT","Yale","Tufts","Open_textbooks","Connexions","Wikibooks","Open_Education_Resources","Free_content","Creative_Commons_licenses","Open_Publication_License","Open_Content_Project","Open_Content_License","Against_DRM_license","GNU_Free_Documentation_License","Open_Game_License","Wizards_of_the_Coast","Free_Art_License","Digital_freedom","Free_content","Ideagoras","Libre_knowledge","Open_catalogue","Open_data","Open_source","Writing_Commons"]}
