It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895\nby Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel\nwas personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a\nprize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel\nprize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the\nanniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the\nmonetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred\nNobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its\nreverse side is unique to this medal.\n\nAs of 2011, 102 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 199\nmen and 10 women. The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in\n1901 to the German physiologist Emil Adolf von Behring, for his work on serum\ntherapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria. The first woman to\nwin the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Gerty Cori, received it in 1947\nfor her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose, important in many aspects\nof medicine, including treatment of diabetes. In 2011, the prize was awarded to\nBruce Beutler of the United States and Jules A. Hoffmann of France \"for their\ndiscoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity\" and to Ralph M.\nSteinman of Canada \"for his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in\nadaptive immunity.\" Some awards have been\ncontroversial. This includes one to AntÃ³nio Egas Moniz in 1949 for the\nprefrontal leucotomy, bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment.\nOther controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the\naward. The 1952 prize to Selman Waksman was litigated in court, and half the\npatent rights awarded to his co-discoverer Albert Schatz who was not recognized\nby the prize. The 1962 prize awarded to James D. Watson, Francis Crick and\nMaurice Wilkins for their work on DNA structure and properties did not\nacknowledge the contributing work from others, such as Oswald Avery and Rosalind\nFranklin who had died by the time of the nomination. Since the Nobel Prize rules\nforbid nominations of the deceased, longevity is an asset, one prize being\nawarded as long as 50 years after the discovery. Also forbidden is awarding any\none prize to more than three recipients, and since in the last half century\nthere has been an increasing tendency for scientists to work as teams, this rule\nhas resulted in controversial exclusions.\n","linknr":1027,"url":"Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","recorded":1362510481,"links":98,"instances":["doctor","neurophysiologist","scientist"],"pdf":["http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/prize_amounts.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/prize_amounts.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf","http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/92/4/507.pdf","http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/92/4/507.pdf","http://www.biology.buffalo.edu/courses/bio130/medler/banting.pdf","http://www.biology.buffalo.edu/courses/bio130/medler/banting.pdf","http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXVI/2/150.full.pdf","http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXVI/2/150.full.pdf"],"categories":["Nobel
