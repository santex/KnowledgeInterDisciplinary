{"cursor":"11204","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'George Fletcher Moore' (10 December 1798 â 30 December 1886) was a prominent\nearly settler in colonial Western Australia, and \"one [of] the key figures in\nearly Western Australia's ruling elite\" (Cameron, 2000). He conducted a number\nof exploring expeditions; was responsible for one of the earliest published\nrecords of the language of the Australian Aborigines of the Perth area; and was\nthe author of Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western\nAustralia.\n\nGeorge Fletcher Moore was born on 17 December 1798 at Bond's Glen, Donemana,\nCounty Tyrone in Ireland. He was educated at Foyle College in Derry, and at\nTrinity College in Dublin. He graduated in law in 1820, and spent the next six\nyears at the Irish Bar, but seeing little prospect of advancement he decided to\npursue a judicial career in the colonies. Moore enquired at the Colonial Office\nafter an official posting to the recently established Swan River Colony in\nWestern Australia, but was told that such appointments were the responsibility\nof the Governor of Western Australia, Sir James Stirling, and could not be\nguaranteed by the Colonial Office. However the Colonial Office promised him a\nletter of introduction should he choose to emigrate.\n\nMoore sailed from Dublin bound for Western Australia on board the Cleopatra,\narriving at the Swan River Colony on 30 October 1830. He then learned that\nWilliam Mackie had been appointed Chairman of the Courts of Petty and Quarter\nSessions in the previous December, effectively eliminating any chances of an\nofficial judicial appointment for Moore. He therefore turned his attention to\nthe problems of obtaining his land grant and establishing a farm. By the end of\nNovember, Moore had claimed a large area of land in the Avon Valley, which he\nhad not yet seen but had been highly recommended by Robert Dale, who had\nexplored the area in July. Moore also obtained half of William Lamb's grant in\nUpper Swan by agreeing to undertake the improvements necessary to secure the\nentire title.\n\nIn September 1831, Robert Dale led a large party in cutting a road from\nGuildford to the Avon Valley. Eager to see his grant for the first time, Moore\njoined the party. On arriving at the intended site for the town of York, Moore\nand Dale explored much of the Avon River, correctly guessing that the Avon and\nthe Swan were in fact the same river. The information Moore gathered on this\nexpedition guided him in relocating his inland grant to an area with vastly\nbetter pasture land.\n\nIn February 1832, Moore finally obtained the judicial appointment he had hoped\nfor, being appointed a Commissioner of the Civil Court. With good land and a\nregular salary, Moore rapidly consolidated his position as a leading farmer. By\n1833 he had one of the largest flocks of sheep in the colony.\n\nMoore was unusual amongst his contemporaries in that he developed friendly,\nlasting relationships with the Indigenous Australians of the area. As he learned\nmore of their culture, his interest deepened, and he began to take a scholarly\ninterest in their language and customs. In the middle of 1833, Moore published\nin the Perth Gazette the first account of the customs of the Aborigines of the\narea. He advocated compensating the natives for the loss of their land, and also\npromoted the idea of Christianising them. For a while he funded Robert Lyon in\nhis attempt to learn their language, then set out to learn it himself.\n\nBetween 1834 and 1836, Moore went exploring a number of times. In January 1834,\nhe explored up the Swan River, finally confirming the belief that the Swan and\nAvon were the same river. In April 1835, he discovered extended pastoral land\nnear the Garban River, which was subsequently renamed the Moore River. In March\n1836, he explored the land between the Moore River and the northern end of the\nAvon River. In October 1836, he joined a party under John Septimus Roe, which\nexplored inland in the hopes of finding an inland sea, finding instead extremely\narid land.\n\nIn 1834, A collection of Moore's letters to family in England were published\nunder the title Extracts from the Letters and Journals of George Fletcher Moore\nEsq., Now Filling a Judicial Office at the Swan River Settlement. The\npublication was at the request of Moore's father Joseph Moore, and George\nFletcher Moore may have been unaware of the publication for some time\nafterwards.\n\nIn July of the same year, Moore's judicial position was handed over to Mackie,\nand Moore was instead appointed Advocate-General. Moore was initially very upset\nabout his re-appointment, because of the loss of social status in changing from\na judge to a lawyer. His new position, however, accorded him a seat on the\ncolony's Legislative Council, and was therefore a position of great influence.\nMoore took a dislike to many of Governor Stirling's policies, and opposed him on\na number of measures. In particular, from March 1835 he continually opposed\nStirling's proposal to raise a troops of mounted police to protect against\nattack by natives.\n\nEarly in 1839, John Hutt took office as Governor. He shared Moore's interest in\nthe language of the Aborigines, and shortly after his arrival the two of them\ncommenced a project to produce a dictionary of the Aboriginal language. By\nAugust 1840 the dictionary was largely complete. Moore took extended leave in\nMarch 1841, returning to London for two years. In 1842, Moore's dictionary was\npublished under the title [[A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common\nUse Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia]].\n\nMoore returned to Western Australia in 1843, when the Swan River Colony was in a\nsevere recession. Over the next few years, he vigorously opposed a number of\nproposed measures intended to soften the effects of the recession on leading\nland holders. Moore claimed that most of the large land holders that were facing\neconomic ruin had been brought to that position through mismanagement. His hard\nline made many influential enemies, and his popularity plummeted. His views\nbegan to attract ridicule both in the Legislative Council and in the press, but\nhe remained influential as he had the confidence of successive governors John\nHutt and Andrew Clarke.\n\nOn 29 October 1846, Moore married Fanny, stepdaughter of Governor Clarke. In the\nfinal months of 1846, both the Governor and the Colonial Secretary Peter Broun\nwere seriously ill. As son-in-law of the Governor, Moore was one of a few\npersons allowed access to the Governor by his doctors. Because of this\nsubstantial advantage, Moore was appointed acting Colonial Secretary in November\n1846. Broun died that same month, and Clarke died in February 1847, but Moore\ncontinued acting in the position until the arrival of the new Colonial Secretary\nRichard Madden in March 1848.\n\nUnder the acting governorship of Frederick Irwin, Moore's popularity waned\nfurther. The government of Irwin and Moore was extremely unpopular; Battye\n(1924) writes \"every administrative act was viewed with suspicion.... Long years\nof depression and struggle had made the colonists pessimistic, and... they threw\nthe blame on the Government of the day.\" The eventual appointments of Madden and\nthe new Governor Charles Fitzgerald left Moore with almost no influence in the\nnew government.\n\nEarly in 1852, Moore took leave and returned to Ireland. His claimed reason for\ntaking leave was to visit his sick father, but Cameron (2000) states that his\nchief reason was concern for the mental health of his wife. Her condition\ndeteriorated in Ireland, and she refused to return to Western Australia. Moore\nwas forced to resign his seat; his request for a pension was denied. Fanny Moore\ndied in 1863, but Moore still did not return to Western Australia.\n\nIn about 1878, the editor of [[The West Australian]], Sir Thomas Cockburn\nCampbell, sought and was granted permission to serialise Moore's letters. The\nletters appeared in the West Australian in 1881 and 1882. On seeing them in\nprint, Moore decided to republish them in book form. They were published in 1884\nas Diary of Ten Years Eventful Life of an Early Settler in Western Australia.\n\nMoore died in his London apartment on 30 December 1886. Stannage (1978) writes\nthat he died \"apparently friendless\", and Cameron (2000) adds \"it was a sad end\nto a worthwhile colonial career.\"\n","linknr":156,"url":"George_Fletcher_Moore","recorded":1363440312,"links":["/w/index.php?title=George_Fletcher_Moore&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Fletcher_Moore&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:George_Fletcher_Moore.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/George_Fletcher_Moore.jpg/220px-George_Fletcher_Moore.jpg","/wiki/File:George_Fletcher_Moore.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Colony","/wiki/Western_Australia","/wiki/Australian_Aborigine","/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia","/wiki/Diary_of_Ten_Years_Eventful_Life_of_an_Early_Settler_in_Western_Australia","/wiki/Donemana","/wiki/County_Tyrone","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/Derry","/wiki/Dublin","/wiki/Graduation","/wiki/Law","/wiki/Irish_Bar","/wiki/Colonial_Office","/wiki/Swan_River_Colony","/wiki/Governor_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/James_Stirling_(Australian_governor)","/wiki/William_Mackie","/wiki/Land_grants_in_the_Swan_River_Colony","/wiki/Avon_River_(Western_Australia)","/wiki/Robert_Dale","/wiki/Upper_Swan,_Western_Australia","/wiki/Robert_Dale","/wiki/Guildford,_Western_Australia","/wiki/York,_Western_Australia","/wiki/Avon_River_(Western_Australia)","/wiki/Sheep","/wiki/Indigenous_Australians","/wiki/Culture","/wiki/Language","/wiki/Customs","/wiki/Christianity","/wiki/Robert_Lyon_(Australian_settler)","/wiki/Moore_River_(Western_Australia)","/wiki/John_Septimus_Roe","/wiki/Attorney-General_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/Judge","/wiki/Lawyer","/wiki/Western_Australian_Legislative_Council","/wiki/John_Hutt","/wiki/Dictionary","/wiki/London","/wiki/A_Descriptive_Vocabulary_of_the_Language_in_Common_Use_Amongst_the_Aborigines_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/Recession","/wiki/John_Hutt","/wiki/Andrew_Clarke_(governor)","/wiki/Colonial_Secretary_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/Peter_Broun","/w/index.php?title=Richard_Madden_(colonial_secretary)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frederick_Irwin","/wiki/Charles_Fitzgerald","/wiki/The_West_Australian","/wiki/Thomas_Cockburn_Campbell","/wiki/Diary_of_Ten_Years_Eventful_Life_of_an_Early_Settler_in_Western_Australia","/w/index.php?title=George_Fletcher_Moore&action=edit&section=1","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","/wiki/Wikisource","//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:George_Fletcher_Moore","/wiki/James_Sykes_Battye","/wiki/Diary_of_Ten_Years_Eventful_Life_of_an_Early_Settler_in_Western_Australia","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0855641371","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/100653645","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Donemana","/wiki/County_Tyrone","/wiki/Ireland","/wiki/London","/wiki/England","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Fletcher_Moore&oldid=544047917","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Colonial_Secretaries_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/Category:Attorneys-General_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Council","/wiki/Category:Australian_judges","/wiki/Category:Explorers_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/Category:Settlers_of_Western_Australia","/wiki/Category:Irish_explorers","/wiki/Category:Irish_barristers","/wiki/Category:Irish_emigrants_to_Australia","/wiki/Category:Irish_writers","/wiki/Category:People_from_County_Tyrone","/wiki/Category:1798_births","/wiki/Category:1886_deaths","/wiki/Category:Australian_diarists","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Fletcher+Moore&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=George+Fletcher+Moore","/wiki/George_Fletcher_Moore","/wiki/Talk:George_Fletcher_Moore","#","/wiki/George_Fletcher_Moore","/w/index.php?title=George_Fletcher_Moore&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=George_Fletcher_Moore&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_m
