Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding\nfor most privately owned television networks. The vast majority of television\nadvertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from\na few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length infomercials).\nAdvertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods,\nservices and ideas since the dawn of television.\n\nThe effect upon the viewing public of commercial advertisements, and mass media\nin general, has been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries\nas Marshall McLuhan. The viewership of television programming, as measured by\ncompanies such as Nielsen Media Research, is often used as a metric for\ntelevision advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to\nadvertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day\n(called a \"daypart\").\n\nIn many countries, including the United States, television campaign\nadvertisements are considered indispensable for a political campaign. In other\ncountries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily\nrestricted, Fritz Plasser, Global Political Campaigning, p226 while\nsome countries, such as Norway, completely ban political ads.\n\n\nThe first television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on July 1,\n1941. The watchmaker Bulova paid $9 for a placement on New York station WNBT\nbefore a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies.\nThe 10-second spot displayed a picture of a clock superimposed on a map of the\nUnited States, accompanied by the voice-over \"America runs on Bulova\ntime.\" The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on ITV on\n21 September 1955, advertising Gibbs SR toothpaste. The first TV Ad broadcast in\nthe Philippines was on ABS-CBN in 1960, advertising Tide detergent powder. Until\nthe early 1990s, advertising on television had only been affordable for large\ncompanies willing to make a significant investment, but the advent of desktop\nvideo allowed many small and local businesses to produce television ads for\nairing on local cable TV services.\n","linknr":731,"url":"Television_commercial","recorded":1362481227,"links":49,"instances":["tv_series","television_commercial","u2_song","brand","tv_series","popular_music","media","1956_film","new_zealand","denmark","tv_network","filmmaking","sound","broadcaster","denmark","malaysia","song","marketing","song","uk","song","tv_channel","malaysia","song","proposed_law","commercial","cigarette"],"pdf":["http://www.bci.ie/documents/88act.pdf","http://www.bci.ie/documents/88act.pdf","http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/201007_bai_rulesadvtel_eng1.pdf","http://www.bai.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/201007_bai_rulesadvtel_eng1.pdf","http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/aba/contentreg/codes/television/documents/2010-commercial_tv_industry_code_of_practice.pdf"],"categories":["Promotion
