It is frequently used in physiology.\n\nThe Bunsen coefficient is defined as the volume of gas, reduced to 273.15 K (0\nÂ°C) and 101.3 kPa, which is absorbed (under equilibrium) per unit volume of a\npure liquid solvent at a specified temperature, under the partial pressure of\nthe gas of 101.3 kPa.

ISBN 0 471 9225 5.\n\nThe units of volume are unimportant as long as they are the same, but often\ncm 3 are used. In the SI system, the Bunsen coefficient is dimensionless.
