{"cursor":"139796","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Racism' is usually defined as views, practices and actions reflecting the\nbelief that humanity is divided into distinct biological groups called races and\nthat members of a certain race share certain attributes which make that group as\na whole less desirable, more desirable, inferior or\nsuperior. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/488187/racism Racism]\nEncyclopÃ¦dia\nBritannica [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/racism\nRacism] Oxford Dictionaries \"Racism\" in R. Schaefer.\n2008 Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society. SAGE. p. 1113\n\nThe exact definition of racism is controversial both because there is little\nscholarly agreement about the meaning of the concept \"race\", and because there\nis also little agreement about what does and doesn't constitute discrimination.\nCritics argue that the term is applied differentially, with a focus on such\nprejudices by whites, and defining mere observations of racial differences as\nracism. Some definitions would have it that any assumption that a\nperson's behavior would be influenced by their racial categorization is racist,\nregardless of whether the action is intentionally harmful or pejorative. Other\ndefinitions only include consciously malignant forms of\ndiscrimination. Among the questions about how to define racism are\nthe question of whether to include forms of discrimination that are\nunintentional, such as making assumptions about preferences or abilities of\nothers based on racial stereotypes, whether to include symbolic or\ninstitutionalized forms of discrimination such as the circulation of ethnic\nstereotypes through the media, and whether to include the socio-political\ndynamics of social stratification that sometimes have a racial component. Some\ndefinitions of racism also include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on\ncultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes.\n\nRacism and 'racial discrimination' are often used to describe discrimination on\nan ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are\ndescribed as racial. According to the United Nations convention, there is no\ndistinction between the terms racial discrimination and [[Ethnic group|ethnic]]\ndiscrimination, and superiority based on racial differentiation is\nscientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and\nthat there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in\npractice, anywhere.\n\nIn history, racism has been a major part of the political and ideological\nunderpinning of genocides such as The Holocaust, but also in colonial contexts\nsuch as the rubber booms in South America and the Congo, and in the European\nconquest of the Americas and colonization of Africa, Asia and Australia. It was\nalso a driving force behind the transatlantic slave trade, and behind states\nbased on racial segregation such as the USA in the nineteenth and early\ntwentieth centuries and South Africa under apartheid. Practices and\nideologies of racism are universally condemned by the United Nations in the\nDeclaration of Human Rights.
