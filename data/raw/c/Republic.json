{"cursor":"60277","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'republic' is a form of government in which the country is considered a\n\"public matter\" (Latin: res publica), not the private concern or property of\nthe rulers, and where offices of state are subsequently directly or indirectly\nelected or appointed rather than inherited. In modern times, a common\nsimplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is\nnot a monarch. Currently, 135\nof the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \"republic\" as part of their\nofficial names.\n\nBoth modern and ancient republics vary widely in their ideology and\ncomposition. In classical and medieval times the archetype of all republics was\nthe Roman Republic, which referred to Rome in between the period when it had\nkings, and the periods when it had emperors. The Italian medieval and\nRenaissance political tradition today referred to as \"civic humanism\" is\nsometimes considered to derive directly from Roman republicans such as Sallust\nand Tacitus. However, Greek-influenced Roman authors, such as Polybius and\nCicero, sometimes also used the term as a translation for the Greek\n[[wikt:politeia|politeia]] which could mean regime generally, but could also be\napplied to certain specific types of regime which did not exactly correspond to\nthat of the Roman Republic. Republics were not equated with classical\ndemocracies such as Athens, but had a democratic aspect.\n\nIn modern republics such as the United States, France, Russia, India, and Mexico\nthe executive is legitimized both by a constitution and by popular suffrage.\nMontesquieu included both democracies, where all the people have a share in\nrule, and aristocracies or oligarchies, where only some of the people rule, as\nrepublican forms of government. Montesquieu, Spirit of the Laws, Bk. II, ch.\n2â3.\n\nMost often a republic is a sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign\nstate entities that are referred to as republics, or which have governments that\nare described as \"republican\" in nature. For instance, Article IV of the\nConstitution of the United States \"guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a\nRepublican form of Government\". [http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/-\nconstitution_transcript.html Constitution of the United States.] The\nsubdivisions of the Soviet Union were described as republics and two of them â\nUkrainian SSR and Byelorussian SSR â had their own seats at the United Nations.\nWhile the Constitution of the Soviet Union described that union as a \"unitary,\nfederal and multinational state\", it was in reality a unitary state since the\nCommunist Party of the Soviet Union exercised a centralized form of authority\nover the nominally-autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics.\n","linknr":920,"url":"Republic","recorded":1362665456,"links":157,"instances":["government","government","ancient_city","nation","iceland","author","ancient_rome","political_science","united_states","1917","political"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Forms
