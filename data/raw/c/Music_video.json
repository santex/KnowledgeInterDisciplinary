{"cursor":"62999","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'music video' or 'song video' is a short film integrating a song and imagery,\nproduced for promotional or artistic purposes. Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a\nmarketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. Although the\norigins of music videos date back much further, they came into prominence in the\n1980s, when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these\nworks were described by various terms including \"illustrated song\", \"filmed\ninsert\", \"promotional (promo) film\", \"promotional clip\", \"song video\", \"song\nclip\" or \"film clip\".\n\nMusic videos use a wide range of styles of film making techniques, including\nanimation, live action filming, documentaries, and non-narrative approaches such\nas abstract film. Some music videos blend different styles, such as animation\nand live action. Many music videos interpret images and scenes from the song's\nlyrics, while others take a more thematic approach. Other music videos may be\nwithout a set concept, being merely a filmed version of the song's live\nperformance.\n","linknr":1009,"url":"Music_video","recorded":1362477676,"links":65,"instances":["new_zealand","music","album","band","australian_broadcaster","rihanna_song","entertainer","30_seconds_to_mars_song","band","massive_attack_song","song","band","video","lady_gaga_song","drug","band","sex_pistols_song","writer","song","pink_floyd_song","song","singer","mötley_crüe_song","david_bowie_song","björk_song","director","song","song","michael_jackson_song","music_video","uk_tv_channel","musician","song","song","music_tv","tv_channel","marketing","musicologist","narrative","song","the_beatles_song","tv_channel","queen_song","band","ciara_song","french_tv","inxs_song","tv_network","30_seconds_to_mars_song","filmmaker","song","french_band","song","band","band","song","madonna_song","maroon_5_song","band","music_producer","director","choreographer","song","tv_station","song","eric_prydz_song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Music
