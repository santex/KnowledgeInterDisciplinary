A bivalve shell is composed of\ntwo hinged valves which are joined by a ligament.]] [[Arianta arbustorum]]]]\n\nThe 'mollusc' (or 'mollusk' Often spelled 'mollusk shell' in\nthe USA; the spelling \"mollusc\" is preferred by ) 'shell' is typically a\ncalcareous exoskeleton which encloses, supports and protects the soft parts of\nan animal in the phylum Mollusca, which includes snails, clams, tusk shells, and\nseveral other classes. Not all shelled molluscs live in the sea, many live on\nthe land and in freshwater.\n\nThe ancestral mollusc is thought to have had a shell, but this has subsequently\nbeen lost or reduced on some families, such as the squid, octopus, and some\nsmaller groups such as the caudofoveata and solenogastres, and the\nhighly derived [[Xenoturbella]]. Jacobs David K. 2000.\nMolluscan engrailed expression, serial organization, and shell evolution.\nEvolution & Development 2: 340. Today, over 100,000 living species bear a\nshell; there is some dispute as to whether these shell-bearing molluscs form a\nmonophyletic group (conchifera) or whether shell-less molluscs are interleaved\ninto their family tree.\n\nMalacology, the scientific study of molluscs as living organisms, has a branch\ndevoted to the study of shells, and this is called conchology - although these\nterms used to be, and to a minor extent still are, used interchangeably, even by\nscientists (this is more common in Europe).\n\nWithin some species of molluscs there is often a surprising degree of variation\nin the exact shape, pattern, ornamentation, and color of the shell.\n","linknr":782,"url":"Mollusc_shell","recorded":1362673027,"links":64,"instances":["gene","gastropod","mollusc","mollusc","cephalopod","chiton","mollusc"],"pdf":["http://jgs.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/131/6/661.pdf","http://jgs.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/131/6/661.pdf"],"categories":["Mollusc anatomy","Mollusc products","Cephalopod zootomy"],"headings":["Formation","Structure","Evolution","Varieties","Damage to shells in collections","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Amerikanische_Bohrmuschel.JPG/220px-Amerikanische_Bohrmuschel.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Arianta_arbustorum_-_Braunau-1968.jpg/220px-Arianta_arbustorum_-_Braunau-1968.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Giant_clam_or_Tridacna_gigas.jpg/220px-Giant_clam_or_Tridacna_gigas.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Tonicella-lineata.jpg/220px-Tonicella-lineata.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Cypraea_chinensis_with_partially_extended_mantle.jpg/220px-Cypraea_chinensis_with_partially_extended_mantle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Nautilus_profile.jpg/220px-Nautilus_profile.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Antalis_vulgaris.jpg/220px-Antalis_vulgaris.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Illex_illecebrosus_anatomy.jpg/60px-Illex_illecebrosus_anatomy.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Pelagic_octopus_Tremoctopus.jpg/60px-Pelagic_octopus_Tremoctopus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Sepia_officinalis_dissected.jpg/60px-Sepia_officinalis_dissected.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mantle","mollusc"],["engrailed","gene"],["gladius","cephalopod"],["engrailed","gene"],["operculum","gastropod"],["valve","chiton"],["varix","mollusc"],["sculpture","mollusc"]],"members":["engrailed","operculum","varix","mantle","gladius","valve","sculpture"],"related":["Bivalve_shell","Exoskeleton","Phylum","Mollusca","Snail","Clam","Tusk_shell","Caudofoveata","Neomeniomorpha","Malacology","Conchology","Species","Mantle_(mollusc)","Calcium_carbonate","Periostracum","Engrailed_(gene)","Hox_gene","C-type_lectin","Lustrin_A","Diatom","Indeterminate_growth","Conchiolin","Gladius_(cephalopod)","Conchiolin","Quinone","Protein","Encyclop√¶dia_Britannica_Ultimate_Reference_Suite","Seashell","Pyrrole","Porphyrin","Calcium_carbonate","Iron_sulfide","Calcite","Aragonite","Nacre","Nacre","Chiton","Aragonite","Opisthobranchia","Pulmonata","Semi-slug","Slug","Engrailed_(gene)","Decapentaplegic","Nacre","Trochidae","Pteriidae","Epithelial_cells","Ectoderm","Cambrian","Limestone","Aptychus","Operculum_(gastropod)","Calcareous","Valve_(chiton)","Varix_(mollusc)","Bursidae","Muricidae","Ranellidae","Cypraeidae","Cassidae","Strombidae","Snails","Cephalopod","Nautilus","Cephalopod","Ammonite","Cuttlefish","Squid","Spirula","Vampire_squid","Cirrina","Octopus","Elephant","Byne's_disease","The_Bailey-Matthews_Shell_Museum","Seashell_surface","Sculpture_(mollusc)","Margaret_Jope"]}
