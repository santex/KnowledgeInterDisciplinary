This, in turn, may break other dependencies and push the problem to\n| another set of packages, thus the term hell.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Dependency_hell","recorded":1362543949,"links":19,"instances":["installation","computing","computing","package_manager","software","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.princeton.edu/~jdonald/research/shared_libraries/cs518_report.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~jdonald/research/shared_libraries/cs518_report.pdf"],"categories":["Anti-patterns","Package management systems","Revision control systems","Computer errors"],"headings":["Overview","Problems","Solutions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["software_package","installation"],["coupling","computer_programming"],["library","computing"],["platform","computing"],["portage","software"],["pacman","package_manager"],["coupling","computer_science"]],"members":["software_package","platform","library","pacman","portage","coupling"],"related":["Software_package_(installation)","Coupling_(computer_programming)","Software_versioning","Reinventing_the_wheel","Software_component","Commercial_off-the-shelf","Specifications","Anti-pattern","Library_(computing)","Platform_(computing)","Java_Platform","Refactoring","GNU_C_Library","Windows","Global_Assembly_Cache","Package_manager","Linux","Revision_Control","RPM_Package_Manager","Dpkg","Software_repository","File_transfer_protocol","File_directory","Computer_network","Mirror_site","Advanced_Packaging_Tool","Yellow_Dog_Updater_Modified","Urpmi","ZYpp","Portage_(software)","Pacman_(package_manager)","PC-BSD","FreeBSD","Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle","Requirement","Tree_structure","Advanced_Packaging_Tool","Software_appliances","Software_appliance","Portable_applications","Computing_platform","DLL_hell","Microsoft_Windows","Extension_conflict","Mac_OS","JAR_hell","Java_Runtime_Environment","Red_Hat","Linux","RPM_Package_Manager","Coupling_(computer_science)","Configuration_management","Software_appliance"]}
