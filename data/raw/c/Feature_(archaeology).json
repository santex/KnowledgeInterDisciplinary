{"cursor":"2688","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Feature' in archaeology and especially excavation has several different but\nallied meanings. A feature is a collection of one or more contexts representing\nsome human non-portable activity that generally has a vertical characteristic to\nit in relation to site stratigraphy. Examples of features are pits, walls, and\nditches. General horizontal elements in the stratigraphic sequence, such as\nlayers, dumps, or surfaces are 'not' referred to as features. Examples of\nsurfaces include yards, roads, and floors.\n\nFeatures 'tend' to have an intrusive characteristic or associated cuts. This is\nnot definitive as surfaces can be referred to as features of a building and free\nstanding structures with no construction cut can still be features. Middens\n(dump deposits) are also referred to as features due to their discrete\nboundaries. This is seen in comparison to leveling dumps, which stretch out over\na substantial portion of a site. The concept of a feature is, to a certain\ndegree, fuzzy, as it will change depending on the scale of excavation.\n","linknr":271,"url":"Feature_(archaeology)","recorded":1362554589,"links":21,"instances":["archaeology","archaeological","archaeology","architecture","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","archaeology","burial"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Methods and principles in archaeology","Archaeological features|"],"headings":["Generic feature types","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["excavation","archaeology"],["stratification","archaeology"],["cut","archaeology"],["sequence","archaeological"],["cut","archaeology"],["excavation","archaeology"],["cut","archaeology"],["cut","archaeology#re-cuts"],["foundation","architecture"],["enclosure","archaeology"],["grave","burial"],["excavation","archaeology"],["relationship","archaeology"],["cut","archaeology"],["fill","archaeology"]],"members":["enclosure","sequence","relationship","foundation","stratification","cut","fill","excavation","grave"],"related":["Excavation_(archaeology)","Archaeological_context","Vertical_direction","Stratification_(archaeology)","Cut_(archaeology)","Horizontal_plane","Sequence_(archaeological)","Cut_(archaeology)","Midden","Excavation_(archaeology)","Megalithic_architectural_elements","Archaeological_record","Cut_(archaeology)","Posthole","Wall","Foundation_(architecture)","Ditch","Drainage","Water_well","Cistern","Hearth","Enclosure_(archaeology)","Lynchet","Grave_(burial)","Burial","Midden","Pit-house","Fire_pit","Archaeological_context","Excavation_(archaeology)","Archaeological_field_survey","Single_context_recording","Harris_matrix","Archaeological_plan","Archaeological_association","Relationship_(archaeology)","Cut_(archaeology)","Archaeological_section","Fill_(archaeology)"]}
