The research was conducted with\nthe goal of producing a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a\nshortage of dietary vitamin A, One existing crop, genetically engineered\n\"golden rice\" that produces vitamin A, already holds enormous promise for\nreducing blindness and dwarfism that result from a vitamin-A deficient diet. -\nBill Frist, physician and politician, in a Washington Times commentary -\nNovember 21, 2006 [http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20061120-094716-\n8709r.htm] which is estimated to kill 670,000 children under 5 each\nyear. Black RE et al., Maternal and child undernutrition: global and\nregional exposures and health consequences, The Lancet, 2008, 371(9608), p.\n253.\n\nGolden rice differs from its parental strain by the addition of three beta-\ncarotene biosynthesis genes. The scientific details of the rice were first\npublished in [[Science (journal)|Science]] in 2000, the\nproduct of an eight-year project by Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute\nof Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg. At the time of\npublication, golden rice was considered a significant breakthrough in\nbiotechnology, as the researchers had engineered an entire biosynthetic pathway.\n\nIn 2005, a new variety called Golden Rice 2, which produces up to 23 times more\nbeta-carotene than the original golden rice, was announced. Although golden rice was developed as a humanitarian\ntool, it has met with significant opposition from environmental and anti-\nglobalization activists.\n\nGolden Rice is still being developed and evaluated and has not yet been approved\nfor widescale use in any country.
