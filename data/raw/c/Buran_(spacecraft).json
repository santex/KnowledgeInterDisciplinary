Buran\ncompleted one unmanned spaceflight in 1988 and remains the only Soviet space\nshuttle that was launched into space, as the Buran programme was cancelled in\n1993. The shuttle Buran was destroyed in 2002 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome when\nthe hangar in which it was stored collapsed. .\n\nIn addition to the shuttle Buran, four other space shuttles were being built in\nthe Buran programme before its cancellation:\n* OK-1K2 ''Ptichka'' (95-97% complete)\n* OK-2K1 ''Baikal'' (30-50% complete)\n* Shuttle 2.02 (10-20% complete)\n* Shuttle 2.03 (dismantled) More than a dozen test models, mock-ups or scale\n  models were built, of which the \"analogue aero test model\" OK-GLI flew\n  atmospheric and the 1/8 scale model BOR-5 made sub-orbital test flights.\n","linknr":350,"url":"Buran_(spacecraft)","recorded":1362268025,"links":62,"instances":["moscow","spacecraft","rocket"],"pdf":["http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4110/vol3.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050010181_2005010059.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050010181_2005010059.pdf"],"categories":["Manned spacecraft","Partially reusable space launch vehicles","Rocket-powered aircraft","Shuttle Buran program","Delta-wing aircraft","Soviet inventions","Buran programme"],"headings":["Overview","Flight into space","Projected flights","Reported Destruction","Tourism","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Buran.jpg/200px-Buran.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Buran_on_An-225_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29_%28cropped%29.JPEG/320px-Buran_on_An-225_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29_%28cropped%29.JPEG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Antonov_An-225_with_Buran_at_Le_Bourget_1989_Manteufel.jpg/220px-Antonov_An-225_with_Buran_at_Le_Bourget_1989_Manteufel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Buran_rear_view_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29.JPEG/170px-Buran_rear_view_%28Le_Bourget_1989%29.JPEG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/RocketSunIcon.svg/28px-RocketSunIcon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Space_Shuttle_diagram.jpg/65px-Space_Shuttle_diagram.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ptichka","spacecraft"],["gorky_park","moscow"],["n1","rocket"]],"members":["gorky_park","ptichka","n1"],"related":["GRAU","Space_Shuttle","Gleb_Lozino-Lozinskiy","S.P._Korolev_Rocket_and_Space_Corporation_Energia","Buran_programme","Baikonur_Cosmodrome","Buran_programme","Ptichka_(spacecraft)","Shuttle_2.01","Shuttle_2.02","Shuttle_2.03","OK-GLI","BOR-5","Dmitriy_Ustinov","Boris_Chertok","Space_Shuttle_program","TsNIIMash","Gleb_Lozino-Lozinskiy","Cosmonaut","Oleg_Kotov","Antonov_An-225","Coordinated_Universal_Time","Baikonur_Cosmodrome","Energia","RD-170","Valentin_Glushko","RD-0120","Boeing_X-37","Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union","Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster","Prospective_Piloted_Transport_System","Kliper","Hangar","Buran_programme","Kazakhstan","Mock-up","Gorky_Park_(Moscow)","Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-105","Space_Shuttle","N1_(rocket)","Spaceplane","Spacecraft"]}
