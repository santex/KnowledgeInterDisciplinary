The symbol Âµm is sometimes\nrendered as 'um' if the symbol Âµ cannot be used.\n\nThe micrometre is a common unit of measurement for wavelengths of infrared\nradiation as well as sizes of cells and\nbacteria.

In Unicode,\nit has a codepoint distinct from that of the Greek letter lowercase mu so that\nit can be recognized as a symbol and not a letter. Many fonts use the same glyph\nfor the two characters.\n","linknr":216,"url":"Micrometre","recorded":1362538667,"links":67,"instances":["length","computing","letter","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Units of length","Orders of magnitude (length)|-06"],"headings":["ISI Standardization","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["mu","letter"],["character","computing"],["thou","length"],["thou","length"]],"members":["thou","character","mu","cell"],"related":["SI_derived_unit","Length","Metre","Micro-","Inch","Measurement","Wavelength","Infrared_radiation","Cell_(biology)","Bacteria","Metric_prefix","Mu_(letter)","Unicode","Unicode_symbols","Character_(computing)","Geology","Biology","Physics","Astronomy","Machining","Semiconductor_industry","American_English","Micrometer","Homograph","Thou_(length)","Thou_(length)","Inch","Trash_bag","Metric_system","Si_prefix","Orders_of_magnitude","Wool_measurement"]}
