The region is bounded nearer the 5' end by a\nstart codon and nearer the 3' end with a stop codon. The coding region in mRNA\nis bounded by the five prime untranslated region and the three prime\nuntranslated region, which are also parts of the exons. {{cite web\n  | last = Twyman first = Richard title = Gene Structure publisher = The\n  | Wellcome Trust date = 1 August 2003 url =\n  | http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD020755.html accessdate = 6 April 2003}}\n\n\nThe coding region of an organism is sum total of the organism's genome that is\ncomposed of gene coding regions. {{Cite book\n  | last = Goto et al. first = Mami title = Analysis of CpG Dinucleotide\n  | Frequency in Bacterial Genomes with Respect to Genomic Regions and Codon\n  | publisher =The Fourth Annual International Conference on Computational\n  | Molecular Biology, Tokyo, Japan date = April 8, 2000 url = http://recomb2000.ims.u-\n  | tokyo.ac.jp/Posters/pdf/112.pdf accessdate = 6 April 2009}}\n\n","linknr":125,"url":"Coding_sequence","recorded":1362374180,"links":23,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://recomb2000.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Posters/pdf/112.pdf","http://recomb2000.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Posters/pdf/112.pdf"],"categories":["DNA"],"headings":["Coding sequence annotation","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/AlphaHelixSection.svg/40px-AlphaHelixSection.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["directionality","molecular_biology#5′-end"],["directionality","molecular_biology#3′-end"]],"members":["directionality"],"related":["Gene","DNA","RNA","Exon","Start_codon","Stop_codon","MRNA","Five_prime_untranslated_region","Three_prime_untranslated_region","Organism","Genome","Open_reading_frames","Gene_prediction","Open_reading_frame","Gene_prediction"]}
