{"cursor":"13288","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn human-computer interaction, 'cut and paste' and 'copy and paste' are related\ncommands that offer a user-interface interaction technique for transferring\ntext, data, files or objects from a source to a destination. Most ubiquitously,\nusers require the ability to cut and paste sections of plain text. The 'cut'\ncommand removes the selected data from its original position, while the 'copy'\ncommand creates a duplicate; in both cases the selected data is placed in a\nclipboard. The data in the clipboard is later inserted in the position where the\n'paste' command is issued.\n\nThe command names are an interface metaphor based on the physical procedure used\nin manuscript editing to create a page layout.\n\nThis interaction technique has close associations with related techniques in\ngraphical user interfaces that use pointing devices such as a computer mouse (by\ndrag and drop, for example).\n","linknr":233,"url":"Cut,_copy,_and_paste","recorded":1362674372,"links":29,"instances":["computer_science","computers","software","data_structure","computing","computing","text_editor","computing","text_editor","software_developer","computing_wimp","user_interface","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["User interface techniques"],"headings":["History","Cut and paste","Copy and paste","Common keyboard shortcuts","Additional differences between moving and copying","Multiple clipboards","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["command","computing"],["data","computing"],["object","computer_science"],["selection","user_interface"],["clipboard","software"],["qed","text_editor"],["qed","text_editor"],["cursor","computers"],["clipboard","software"],["pico","text_editor"],["cursor","computers"],["character","computing"],["pointer","computing_wimp"],["steve_p_miller","software_developer"],["lifo","computing"],["stack","data_structure"],["clipboard","software"]],"members":["object","cursor","clipboard","stack","character","lifo","qed","data","pico","steve_p_miller","pointer","selection","command"],"related":["Human-computer_interaction","Command_(computing)","User_interface","Interaction_technique","Data_(computing)","Computer_file","Object_(computer_science)","Plain_text","Selection_(user_interface)","Clipboard_(software)","Interface_metaphor","Page_layout","Graphical_user_interface","Pointing_device","Computer_mouse","Drag_and_drop","Scissors","Adhesive","Photocopier","Data_buffer","QED_(text_editor)","Computer_keyboard","Lawrence_G._Tesler","Xerox_PARC","Apple_Computer","Apple_Lisa","Apple_Macintosh","Command_key","Modifier_key","Computer_keyboard","QWERTY","Modifier_key","Control-Z","Undo","Control-X","Control-C","Control-V","Control-V","QED_(text_editor)","IBM_Common_User_Access","Insert_key","Del_key","Shift_key","Control_key","Microsoft_Windows","Microsoft","Microsoft_Windows","Control_key","Modifier_key","Control_character","Toolbar","Dragging","Shift_key","Arrow_keys","Cursor_(computers)","Control_key","Command_key","Macintosh","Clipboard_(software)","Unix","Clipboard_manager","Microsoft_Office","Unix","Text_editor","Pico_(text_editor)","Vi","Cursor_(computers)","Character_(computing)","Data","Disk_storage","Graphical_user_interface","Control_key","Context_menu","Toolbar","Clipboard","Macintosh_computers","Command_key","X_Window_System","Pointer_(computing_WIMP)","Terminal_emulator","IBM_Common_User_Access","PureText","Steve_P_Miller_(software_developer)","Meta_key","Spreadsheet","Windows_Explorer","Clipboard_manager","LIFO_(computing)","Stack_(data_structure)","Emacs","Richard_Stallman","Control_key","Copy_and_paste_programming","Photomontage","Clipboard_(software)","Drag_and_drop","Publishing_Interchange_Language","X_Window_selection","Pastebin","ICCCM"]}
