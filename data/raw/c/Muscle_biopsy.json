A biopsy needle is usually inserted into\na muscle, wherein a small amount of tissue remains. Alternatively, an \"open\nbiopsy\" can be performed by obtaining the muscle tissue through a small surgical\nincision. A muscle biopsy can lead to the discovery of problems with a nervous\nsystem, connective tissue, vascular system, or musculoskeletal system. In humans\nwith weakness and low muscle tone, a muscle biopsy can help distinguish between\nmyopathies (where the pathology is in the muscle tissue itself) and neuropathies\n(where the pathology is at the nerves innervating those muscles). Muscle\nbiopsies can also help to distinguish among various types of myopathies, by\nmicroscopic analysis for differing characteristics when exposed to a variety of\nchemical reactions and stains.\n\nHowever, in some cases the muscle biopsy alone is inadequate to distinguish\nbetween certain myopathies. For example, a muscle biopsy showing the nucleus\npathologically located in the center of the muscle cell would indicate\n\"centronuclear myopathy\", but research has shown that a variety of myopathies\ncan cause these centronuclear biopsy appearance, and hence the specific genetic\ntesting becomes increasingly important. Additionally\nmuscle biopsy is the only certain way to clarify ones muscle fiber types. I.e.\nby undergoing a muscle biopsy one can get a clear picture of which type of\nmuscles dominates his/her body.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Muscle_biopsy","recorded":1362510873,"links":17,"instances":["including_myotubular_myopathy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biopsy","Muscular system"],"headings":["References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Ragged_red_fibres_-_gtc_-_very_high_mag.jpg/230px-Ragged_red_fibres_-_gtc_-_very_high_mag.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Pectoralis_major.png/35px-Pectoralis_major.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["centronuclear_myopathy","including_myotubular_myopathy"],["centronuclear_myopathy","including_myotubular_myopathy"],["centronuclear_myopathy","including_myotubular_myopathy"]],"members":["centronuclear_myopathy"],"related":["Micrograph","Ragged_red_fibers","Mitochondrial_diseases","Gomori_trichrome_stain","Medicine","Muscle","Biological_tissue","Organism","Microscopy","Needle_aspiration_biopsy","Nervous_system","Connective_tissue","Vascular_system","Musculoskeletal_system","Myopathies","Neuropathies","Myopathies","Centronuclear_myopathy_(including_myotubular_myopathy)","Myopathies","Genetic_testing","Atrophy","Necrosis","Necrotizing_vasculitis","Muscular_dystrophy","Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy","Becker's_muscular_dystrophy","Centronuclear_myopathy_(including_myotubular_myopathy)","Centronuclear_myopathy_(including_myotubular_myopathy)","Electromyogram","Trichinosis","Toxoplasmosis","Myasthenia_gravis","Polymyositis","Dermatomyositis","Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","Friedreich's_ataxia"]}
