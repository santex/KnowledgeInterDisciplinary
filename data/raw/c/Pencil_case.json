A pencil case can also contain a variety of other\nstationery such as a sharpener, pens, glue sticks, erasers, and scissors.\n\nPencil cases can be made from a variety of materials such as wood or metal. Some\npencil cases have a hard and rigid shell encasing the pens inside while others\nuse a softer material such as plastic, leather, or cotton. Soft versions are\ntypically fastened with a zipper. Decorated versions are popular with\nschoolchildren depending on age and gender.\n\nEarly pencil cases were round or cylindrical in shape. Some early pencil cases\nwere decorated with jasper (one from 1860) or platinum (from 1874).\n","linknr":125,"url":"Pencil_case","recorded":1362898059,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Containers"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Skolni_penal.jpg/200px-Skolni_penal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Container","Pencil","Stationery","Sharpener","Pen","Glue_stick","Eraser","Scissors","Wood","Metal","Plastic","Leather","Cotton","Zipper","Schoolchild","Jasper","Platinum","Pencil","School"]}
