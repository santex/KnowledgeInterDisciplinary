This is useful in neutralizing the acidic gastric acid,\nallowing for effective enzymic action.\n\nPancreatic juice secretion is regulated by the hormones secretin and\ncholecystokinin, which is produced by the walls of the duodenum upon detection\nof acid food, proteins and fats, vitamins. Pancreatic secretion consists of an\naqueous bicarbonate component from the duct cells and enzymatic component from\nthe acinar cells.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Pancreatic_juice","recorded":1362666636,"links":39,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Digestive system","Endocrine system"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png/60px-PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pancreas","Enzymes","Trypsinogen","Chymotrypsinogen","Elastase","Carboxypeptidase","Pancreatic_lipase","Nucleases","Amylase","Hormones","Secretin","Cholecystokinin","Duodenum"]}
