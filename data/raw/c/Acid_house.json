Acid house's core electronic squelch sounds were developed around the\nmid-1980s, particularly by DJs from Chicago, Illinois, who experimented with the\nRoland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. Acid house spread to the United\nKingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and\nlater rave scenes. By the late 1980s, copycat tracks and acid house remixes\nbrought the style into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on\npop and dance styles.\n\nNicknamed the sound of acid, the influence of acid house can be heard\nin subsequent styles of music that include trance, Goa trance,\npsychedelic trance, breakbeat, big beat, techno.\n","linknr":577,"url":"Acid_house","recorded":1362689423,"links":50,"instances":["chris_westbrook","producer","bhagwan_shree_rajneesh","drug","artist","turn_on_the_acid_house","newspaper","musician"],"pdf":["http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/polin/polin055.pdf","http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/eslj/issues/volume1/number3/book_reviews.pdf"],"categories":["African-American music","Acid house|","Madchester"],"headings":["Characteristics","Etymology","History","Significance","Notable artists","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/TB-303.jpg/200px-TB-303.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/BTBbeatdis.jpg/200px-BTBbeatdis.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ecstasy","drug"],["tune_in","turn_on_the_acid_house"],["osho","bhagwan_shree_rajneesh"],["the_sun","newspaper"],["charanjit_singh","musician"],["charanjit_singh","musician"],["adonis","artist"],["armando","producer"],["bam_bam","chris_westbrook"]],"members":["bam_bam","armando","osho","ecstasy","adonis","tune_in","the_sun","charanjit_singh"],"related":["House_music","Chicago_house","United_States","Chicago","Synthesizer","Drum_machine","Music_sequencer","Keyboard_instrument","Roland_TB-303","Roland_TR-808","Roland_TR-707","Roland_TR-909","Roland_TR-606","Korg_M1","Roland_Jupiter-8","New_Beat","Acid_techno","Acid_trance","Goa_trance","Psychedelic_trance","Rave_music","Trance_music","Electro_house","Styles_of_house_music","House_music","Trance_music","DJ","Chicago,_Illinois","Roland_TB-303","United_Kingdom","Europe","Rave","Remix","Trance_music","Goa_trance","Psychedelic_trance","Breakbeat","Big_beat","Techno","Trance_music","DJ","Chicago","Roland_TB-303","Roland_TB-303","Bass_synthesizer","Acid_Tracks","Ron_Hardy","Trax_Records","Acid_rock","Psychedelic_drug","LSD","Club_drug","Ecstasy_(drug)","British_House_of_Commons","Paul_Staines","Genesis_P-Orridge","Psychic_TV","Tune_In_(Turn_on_the_Acid_House)","Osho_(Bhagwan_Shree_Rajneesh)","Simon_Reynolds","Fred_Giannelli","Phuture","Acid_Tracks","Chicago","Illinois","Phuture","DJ_Pierre","Alexander_Robotnick","Acid_Tracks","Ron_Hardy","London","United_Kingdom","Danny_Rampling","Second_Summer_of_Love","Football_hooliganism","Methylenedioxymethamphetamine","Summer_of_Love","Rave","Ibiza","Club_drug","Club_drug","The_Sun_(newspaper)","Smiley","Alan_Moore","Dave_Gibbons","Bananarama","Tripping_on_Your_Love","Samantha_Fox","Love_House","S'Express","Theme_from_S'Express","12\"_single","Charanjit_Singh_(musician)","Charanjit_Singh_(musician)","Bollywood","Music_of_Bollywood","Mumbai","Indian_classical_music","Raga","Disco","Roland_Corporation","Roland_TR-808","Roland_TB-303","India","Trance_music","Goa_trance","Psychedelic_trance","Breakbeat","Big_beat","Techno","Trip-hop","808_State","Manchester","A_Guy_Called_Gerald","Voodoo_Ray","Adonis_(artist)","Alaska_y_Dinarama","Armando_(producer)","Baby_Ford","Bam_Bam_(Chris_Westbrook)","DJ_Pierre","D_Mob","Fast_Eddie","The_KLF","What_Time_Is_Love?","Lil_Louis","Mr._Lee","Maurice_Joshua","This_Is_Acid","Phuture","Chicago","Acid_Tracks","Psychic_TV","Kevin_Saunderson","Cover_version","S'Express","The_Shamen","Aberdeen","Scotland","Free_party","List_of_electronic_music_genres"]}
