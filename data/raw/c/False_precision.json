{"cursor":"4192","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'False precision' (also called 'overprecision', 'fake precision', 'misplaced\nprecision' and 'spurious accuracy') occurs when numerical data are presented in\na manner that implies better precision than is actually the case; since\nprecision is a limit to accuracy, this often leads to overconfidence in the\naccuracy as well.\n\nIn science and engineering, convention dictates that unless a margin of error is\nexplicitly stated, the number of significant figures used in the presentation of\ndata should be limited to what is warranted by the precision of those data. For\nexample, if an instrument can be read to tenths of a unit of measurement,\nresults of calculations using data obtained from that instrument can only be\nconfidently stated to the tenths place, regardless of what the raw calculation\nreturns or whether other data used in the calculation are more accurate. Even\noutside these disciplines, there is a tendency to assume that all the non-zero\ndigits of a number are meaningful; thus, providing excessive figures may lead\nthe viewer to expect better precision than actually exists.\n\nHowever, in contrast, it is good practice to retain more significant figures\nthan this in the intermediate stages of a calculation, in order to avoid\naccumulated rounding errors.\n\nFalse precision commonly arises when high-precision and low-precision data are\ncombined, and in conversion of units.\n","linknr":173,"url":"False_precision","recorded":1362480334,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Arithmetic","Numerical analysis"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Accuracy_and_precision","Science","Engineering","Significant_figures","Conversion_of_units","International_System_of_Units","Propagation_of_uncertainty","Rounding","Round-off_error","Precision_bias","Significant_figures"]}
