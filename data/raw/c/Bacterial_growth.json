{"cursor":"9496","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Bacterial growth' is the division of one piece of bacteria into two daughter\ncells in a process called binary fission. Providing no mutational event occurs\nthe resulting daughter cells are genetically identical to the original cell.\nHence, \"local doubling\" of the bacterial population occurs. Both daughter cells\nfrom the division do not necessarily survive. However, if the number surviving\nexceeds unity on average, the bacterial population undergoes exponential growth.\nThe measurement of an exponential bacterial growth curve in batch culture was\ntraditionally a part of the training of all microbiologists; the basic means\nrequires bacterial enumeration (cell counting) by direct and individual\n(microscopic, flow cytometry ), direct and bulk\n(biomass), indirect and individual (colony counting), or indirect and bulk (most\nprobable number, turbidity, nutrient uptake) methods. Models reconcile theory\nwith the measurements.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Bacterial_growth","recorded":1362374703,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bacteriology","Population"],"headings":["Phases","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Bacterial_growth.png/250px-Bacterial_growth.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Bacterial_growth_en.svg/250px-Bacterial_growth_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Asexual_reproduction","Binary_fission","Exponential_growth","Turbidity","Population_ecology","Bacterium","Bacterium","Cyanobacteria","Chemostat","Turbidostat","Auxostat","Bacteriostat","Community_ecology","Agar","Demographic_transition"]}
