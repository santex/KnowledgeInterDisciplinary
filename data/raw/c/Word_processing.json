It can\nalso refer to advanced shorthand techniques, sometimes used in specialized\ncontexts with a specially modified typewriter. The term was coined at IBM's\nBÃ¶blingen, West Germany (at that time) Laboratory in the 1960s.\n\nThis program will enable the user to write articles, books, letter documents,\nreports, etc. It makes editing a very simple task. The main features of this\nprogram are, Font Application, Spell Check, Grammar Check, Thesaurus,\nAutocorrect, Auto text, Web integration, HTML documentation etc.\n\nWord processor may also refer to a type of stand-alone office machine, popular\nin the 1970s and 1980s, combining the keyboard text-entry and printing functions\nof an electric typewriter with a dedicated processor (like a computer processor)\nfor the editing of text.

Later models introduced innovations such as spell-checking\nprograms, increased formatting options, and dot-matrix printing. As the more\nversatile combination of a personal computer and separate printer became\ncommonplace, most business-machine companies stopped manufacturing the word\nprocessor as a stand-alone office machine. As of 2009 there were only two U.S.\ncompanies, Classic and AlphaSmart, which still made stand-alone word\nprocessors. Mark Newhall, Farm Show. Many older machines, however,\nremain in use. Since 2009, Sentinel has offered a machine described as a word\nprocessor, but in actuality it is more accurately a highly specialised\nmicrocomputer, used for accounting and publishing. StarLux Illumination\ncatalog\n\nWord processors are descended from early text formatting tools (sometimes called\ntext justification tools, from their only real capability). Word processing was\none of the earliest applications for the personal computer in office\nproductivity.\n\nAlthough early word processors used tag-based markup for document formatting,\nmost modern word processors take advantage of a graphical user interface\nproviding some form of what-you-see-is-what-you-get editing. Most are powerful\nsystems consisting of one or more programs that can produce any arbitrary\ncombination of images, graphics and text, the latter handled with type-setting\ncapability.\n\nMicrosoft Word is the most widely used word processing software. Microsoft\nestimates that over 500,000,000 people use the Microsoft Office\nsuite, which includes Word. Many other word processing applications\nexist, including WordPerfect (which dominated the market from the mid-1980s to\nearly-1990s on computers running Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system) and open\nsource applications OpenOffice.org Writer, LibreOffice Writer, AbiWord, KWord,\nand LyX. Web-based word processors, such as Office Web Apps or Google Docs, are\na relatively new category.\n","linknr":471,"url":"Word_processing","recorded":1362477428,"links":73,"instances":["linguistics","paper","word_processing","software","computing","message","software"],"pdf":["http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/compartics/History_of_Word_Processing.pdf","http://www.tomandmaria.com/tom/Writing/Annals2006WP.pdf"],"categories":["Word processors|*","Computing terminology"],"headings":["Characteristics","Document statistics","Typical usage","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/Open_Office_Example_Photo.jpg/250px-Open_Office_Example_Photo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/KWord-1.4.2-screenshot.png/250px-KWord-1.4.2-screenshot.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/LyX15.png/250px-LyX15.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/TOSHIBA_JW-10.JPG/220px-TOSHIBA_JW-10.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Office_Products_output_samples_1980-81.png/220px-Office_Products_output_samples_1980-81.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Hardwarewordprocessor.png/220px-Hardwarewordprocessor.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["template","word_processing"],["character","computing"],["sentence","linguistics"],["page","paper"],["letter","message"],["bravo","software"],["gypsy","software"]],"members":["sentence","page","template","bravo","character","letter","gypsy"],"related":["Computer","Application_software","Shorthand","Typewriter","IBM","Böblingen","Electric_typewriter","Memory_cards","Diskettes","Spell-checking","Personal_computer","Computer_printer","AlphaSmart","Word_processing","Personal_computer","Markup_language","Graphical_user_interface","What-you-see-is-what-you-get","Image","Graphics","Type-setting","Microsoft_Word","Microsoft_Office","WordPerfect","MS-DOS","Operating_system","Open_source","OpenOffice.org_Writer","LibreOffice_Writer","AbiWord","KWord","LyX","Office_Web_Apps","Google_Docs","Template_(word_processing)","Revision_control","Spell_checking","Text_editor","TJ-2","RUNOFF","LaTeX","HTML","Cascading_Style_Sheets","Programmer","LaTeX","Desktop_publishing","Statistics","Character_(computing)","Word_count","Sentence_(linguistics)","Paragraph","Page_(paper)","US_copyright_law","Letter_(message)","Letterhead","Memorandum","Japanese_language","List_of_IEEE_milestones","IBM","Buzz_word","Magnetic_tape_selectric_typewriter","Xerox","Xerox_800","Punched_card","Line_printer","Printer_chain","University_College_London","Punched_tape","Friden_Flexowriter","Form_letter","Mail_merge","IBM_MT/ST","Len_Deighton","Automatic_Electronic_Systems","Micom_Data_Systems","Wang_Laboratories","Philips","Harold_Koplow","IBM_Selectric","Linolex","Lexitron","Vydec","Cathode_ray_tube","Computer_display","Automatic_Electronic_Systems","Canada_Development_Corporation","AES_Data","Pierre_Elliot_Trudeau","Floppy_diskette","Shugart_Associates","Dysan","ASCII","Daisy_wheel_printer","Diablo_Data_Systems","Qume","Electric_Pencil","MultiMate","Control_key","WordStar","Hjkl","VisiCalc","Lotus_1-2-3","DBase","WordPerfect","XyWrite","Microsoft_Word","WYSIWYG","Bitmap","Xerox_Alto","Bravo_(software)","PostScript","Graphical_user_interface","Xerox_PARC","Gypsy_(software)","Xerox_Star","Floppy_disk_drive","MacWrite","Microsoft_Word","Amstrad_PCW","Authoring_systems","Canon_Cat","Comparison_of_word_processors","Content_management_system","CPT_Word_Processors","Document_collaboration","List_of_word_processors","IBM_MT/ST","Office_suite","TeX","Typography","Bruce_Byfield"]}
