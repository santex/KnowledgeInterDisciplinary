{"cursor":"8852","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Immune tolerance' or 'immunological tolerance' is the process by which the\nimmune system does not attack an antigen. It can be either 'natural'\nor 'self tolerance', in which the body does not mount an immune response to self\nantigens, or 'induced tolerance', in which tolerance to external antigens can be\ncreated by manipulating the immune system. It occurs in three forms: central\ntolerance, peripheral tolerance and acquired tolerance.\n\nGenetic defects in these processes lead to autoimmunity, such as in Autoimmune\npolyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) and immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy\nenteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX).\n","linknr":268,"url":"Immune_tolerance","recorded":1362538118,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system","Immunology","WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology articles"],"headings":["Central tolerance","Peripheral tolerance","Acquired tolerance","Immune tolerance to allografts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Immune_system","Antigen","Autoimmunity","Immunodysregulation_polyendocrinopathy_enteropathy_X-linked_syndrome","Self_tolerance","Central_tolerance","Thymus","Bone_marrow","Lymphocytes","Autoimmune_Regulator","Self_tolerance","Peripheral_tolerance","Induced_tolerance","Antigens","Immune_tolerance_in_pregnancy","Fetus","Placenta","Immune_system","Intravenous","Sublingual","Immunosuppression","Organ_transplantation","Transplant_rejection","Hypersensitivity","Mucosa","Inflammatory_bowel_disease","Crohn's_disease","Ulcerative_colitis","Allograft","Central_tolerance","CD22","Sialic_acid_acetylesterase"]}
