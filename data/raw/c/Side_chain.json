The\nplaceholder 'R' is often used as a generic placeholder for alkyl (saturated\nhydrocarbon) group side chains in chemical structure diagrams. To indicate other\nnon-carbon groups in structure diagrams, 'X', 'Y', or 'Z' is often used. The R,\nhistorically, was introduced by 19th-century French chemist Charles FrÃ©dÃ©ric\nGerhardt and may be derived from [[radical (chemistry)|radical]], or from\nresidue and its German equivalent Rest.

Side chains have\nnoteworthy influence on a polymer's properties, mainly its crystallinity and\ndensity. An oligomeric branch may be termed a short-chain branch and a polymeric\nbranch may be termed a long-chain branch. Side groups are different from side\nchains; they are neither oligomeric nor\npolymeric. http://goldbook.iupac.org/B00720.html\n\nIn proteins (composed of amino acids) the side chains are attached to the alpha-\ncarbon atoms of the amide 'backbone'.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Side_chain","recorded":1362371327,"links":26,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organic chemistry"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Polymers_Logo_svg.svg/30px-Polymers_Logo_svg.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organic_chemistry","Biochemistry","Substituent","Backbone_chain","Alkyl","Charles_Frédéric_Gerhardt","Polymer","Oligomer","Backbone_chain","Density","Pendant_group","Protein","Amino_acid","Alpha-carbon","Substituent","Functional_group","Alkyl"]}
