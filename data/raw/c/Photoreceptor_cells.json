The great biological importance of\nphotoreceptors is that they convert light (visible electromagnetic radiation)\ninto signals that can stimulate biological processes. To be more specific,\nphotoreceptor proteins in the cell absorb photons, triggering a change in the\ncell's membrane potential.\n\nThe two classic photoreceptor cells are rods and cones, each contributing\ninformation used by the visual system to form a representation of the visual\nworld, sight. The rods are narrower than the cones and distributed differently\nacross the retina, but the chemical process in each that supports\nphototransduction is similar. \"eye, human.\" EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica.\nEncyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: EncyclopÃ¦dia\nBritannica, 2010. A third class of photoreceptor cells was discovered\nduring the 1990s: the photosensitive ganglion cells.\nThese cells do not contribute to sight directly, but are thought to support\ncircadian rhythms and pupillary reflex.\n\nThere are major functional differences between the rods and cones. Rods are\nextremely sensitive, and can be triggered by as few as 6 photons. At very low light levels, visual experience is based solely on\nthe rod signal. This explains why colors cannot be seen at low light levels:\nonly one type of photoreceptor cell is active.\n\nCones require significantly brighter light (i.e., a larger numbers of photons)\nin order to produce a signal. In humans, there are three different types of cone\ncell, distinguished by their pattern of response to different wavelengths of\nlight. Color experience is calculated from these three distinct signals, perhaps\nvia an opponent process. The three types of cone cell\nrespond (roughly) to light of short, medium, and long wavelengths. Note that,\ndue to the principle of univariance, the firing of the cell depends upon only\nthe number of photons absorbed. The different responses of the three types of\ncone cells are determined by the likelihoods that their respective photoreceptor\nproteins will absorb photons of different wavelengths. So, for example, an L\ncone cell contains a photoreceptor protein that more readily absorbs long\nwavelengths of light (i.e., more \"red\"). Light of a shorter wavelength can also\nproduce the same response, but it must be much brighter to do so.\n\nThe human retina contains about 120 million rod cells and 6 million cone cells.\nThe number and ratio of rods to cones varies among species, dependent on whether\nan animal is primarily diurnal or nocturnal. Certain owls, such as the tawny\nowl, [http://www.owls.org/Information/eyesight.htm \"Owl Eyesight\"] at\nowls.org have a tremendous number of rods in their retinae. In addition,\nthere are about 1.5 million ganglion cells in the human visual system, 1 to 2%\nof them photosensitive.\n\nDescribed here are vertebrate photoreceptors. Invertebrate photoreceptors in\norganisms such as insects and molluscs are different in both their morphological\norganization and their underlying biochemical pathways.\n","linknr":794,"url":"Photoreceptor_cells","recorded":1362567722,"links":38,"instances":["biochemistry","biochemistry","vision","biology","vision","physiology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Human eye anatomy","Histology","Photoreceptor cells|"],"headings":["Histology","Humans","Phototransduction","Function","Development","Signaling","Ganglion cell (non-rod non-cone) photoreceptors","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Rod%26Cone.jpg/180px-Rod%26Cone.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Cone-response.svg/300px-Cone-response.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Eye-diagram_no_circles_border.svg/275px-Eye-diagram_no_circles_border.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/extensions/ImageMap/desc-20.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["soma","biology"],["cell","biology"],["blind_spot","vision"],["hyperpolarization","biology"],["cofactor","biochemistry"],["hyperpolarization","biology"],["stimulus","physiology"],["stimulus","physiology"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["contrast","vision"]],"members":["receptor","cofactor","blind_spot","hyperpolarization","contrast","stimulus","cell","soma"],"related":["Rod_cell","Cone_cell","Neuron","Retina","Phototransduction","Electromagnetic_radiation","Photoreceptor_protein","Photon","Membrane_potential","Rod_cell","Cone_cell","Visual_system","Visual_perception","Photosensitive_ganglion_cell","Circadian_rhythms","Pupillary_reflex","Opponent_process","Diurnal_animal","Nocturnal","Tawny_owl","Ganglion_cell","Vertebrate","Invertebrate_photoreceptor","Insect","Mollusc","Rod_cell","Cone_cell","Retina","Axon","Neurotransmitter","Glutamate","Bipolar_cell","Soma_(biology)","Organelle","Cell_(biology)","Mitochondrion","Adenosine_triphosphate","Sodium-potassium_pump","Brain","Light","Cilia","Opsin","Sodium_channel","Photoreceptor_protein","Rhodopsin","Photopsin","Signal_transduction","Circadian_rhythm","Pupillary_reflex","Melanopsin","Retinylidene_protein","G-protein-coupled_receptor","Nerve_impulse","Axon","Olivary_pretectal_nucleus","Retinohypothalamic_tract","Suprachiasmatic_nucleus","Neurotransmitter","Glutamate","Pituitary_adenylate_cyclase_activating_polypeptide","Retina","Lgn","Fovea","Visual_acuity","Blind_spot_(vision)","Wavelengths","Absorbance","Color_vision","Hyperpolarization_(biology)","Depolarization","Cyclic_guanosine_3'-5'_monophosphate","Ion_channel","Sodium_channel","Calcium","Ions","Electrochemical_gradient","Membrane_potential","Glutamate","Transducin","CGMP_phosphodiesterase","Visual_phototransduction","Cyclic_GMP","Sodium","Ion","Depolarization","Resting_potential","Electric_current","Signal_transduction","Optic_nerve","Rhodopsin","Iodopsin","Retinal","Schiff_base","Cofactor_(biochemistry)","G_protein","Plasma_membrane","Transducin","Protein","G_protein","Enzyme","Phosphodiesterase","Hyperpolarization_(biology)","Glutamate","Bipolar_cell","Ionotropic","Metabotropic","Receptive_field","Action_potential","Photosensitive_ganglion_cell","Circadian_rhythms","Stimulus_(physiology)","Neuronal_noise","Pigment","Transducin","Eric_Kandel","Scotopic_vision","Photopic_vision","Stimulus_(physiology)","Night_blindness","Legal_blindness","Fovea","Fovea","Photosensitive","Photosensitive","Color","Light","Wavelength","Irradiance","Trichromacy","Notch_signaling_pathway","Retinitis_pigmentosa","Macular_degeneration","Presynaptic","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Cell_membrane","Ligand-gated_ion_channel","Metabotropic_receptor","Contrast_(vision)","Edge_detection","Bipolar_cell","Horizontal_cell","Amacrine_cell","Circadian_rhythm","Photosensitive_ganglion_cell","Retinal_ganglion_cell","Retina","Retina","Melanopsin","Pupillary_light_reflex","Human","Conscious","Mesopic_vision","Visual_phototransduction","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Sensory_system","Photosensitive","Photosensitive_ganglion_cell","Horizontal_cell","Bipolar_cell_of_the_retina","Amacrine_cell","Neuroscience_Information_Framework"]}
