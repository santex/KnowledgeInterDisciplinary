Aristotle, ca. 4th century BCE\n\"In general the sign of knowledge or ignorance is the ability to teach, and for\nthis reason we hold that art rather than experience is scientific knowledge\n(epistemÄ); for the artists can teach, but the others cannot.\" â [http://w-\nww.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0052:book=1:section=9-\n81b&highlight=artists%2Cothers Aristot. Met. 1.981b] Since classical\nantiquity science as a type of knowledge was closely linked to philosophy. In\nthe early modern era the words \"science\" and \"philosophy\" were sometimes used\ninterchangeably in the English language. By the 17th century, natural philosophy\n(which is today called \"natural science\") was considered a separate branch of\nphilosophy. Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\n(1687), for example, is translated \"Mathematical Principles of Natural\nPhilosophy\", and reflects the then-current use of the words \"natural\nphilosophy\", akin to \"systematic study of nature\" However, \"science\"\ncontinued to be used in a broad sense denoting reliable knowledge about a topic,\nin the same way it is still used in modern terms such as library science or\npolitical science.\n\nIn modern use, \"science\" more often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not\nonly the knowledge itself. It is \"often treated as synonymous with 'natural and\nphysical science', and thus restricted to those branches of study that relate to\nthe phenomena of the material universe and their laws, sometimes with implied\nexclusion of pure mathematics. This is now the dominant sense in ordinary\nuse.\" Oxford English Dictionary This narrower sense of \"science\"\ndeveloped as scientists such as Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei and Isaac\nNewton began formulating [[laws of nature]] such as Newton's laws of motion. In\nthis period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as \"natural\nscience\". Over the course of the 19th century, the word \"science\" became\nincreasingly associated with the scientific method, a disciplined way to study\nthe natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology. It is in\nthe 19th century also that the term [[scientist]] was created by the naturalist-\ntheologian William Whewell to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature\nfrom those who sought knowledge on other disciplines. The Oxford English\nDictionary dates the origin of the word \"scientist\" to 1834. This sometimes left\nthe study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo, which was resolved\nby classifying these areas of academic study as social science. Similarly,\nseveral other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge exist today under\nthe general rubric of \"science\", such as formal science and applied science.\n","linknr":1606,"url":"Empirical_sciences","recorded":1362540100,"links":220,"instances":["paranormal","journalist","science","journal","american_journalist","polity","text"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20070928151119/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf","http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070928151119/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080409054240/http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf","http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080409054240/http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf","http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/02/CargoCult.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/winter2004/gopnik.pdf","http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/roe/Knowability_590/Week2/Myths%20of%20Science.pdf","http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/roe/Knowability_590/Week2/Myths%20of%20Science.pdf"],"categories":["Science|"],"headings":["History
