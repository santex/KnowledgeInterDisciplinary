Of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major\ndental diseases: dental caries and periodontal disease.\n\nThe mouth harbors a diverse, abundant and complex microbial community. This\nhighly diverse microflora inhabits the various surfaces of the normal mouth.\nBacteria accumulate on both the hard and soft oral tissues in biofilms.\nBacterial adhesion is particularly important for oral bacteria.\n\nOral bacteria have evolved mechanisms to sense their environment and evade or\nmodify the host. Bacteria occupy the ecological niche provided by both the tooth\nsurface and gingival epithelium. However, a highly efficient innate host defense\nsystem constantly monitors the bacterial colonization and prevents bacterial\ninvasion of local tissues. A dynamic equilibrium exists between dental plaque\nbacteria and the innate host defense system.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Oral_microbiology","recorded":1362505935,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology","Dentistry branches","Oral pathology"],"headings":["Oral Bacteria","Dental plaque","Cell-cell communication","Vaccination against oral infections","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Dentistry_stub.svg/14px-Dentistry_stub.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Issoria_lathonia.jpg/32px-Issoria_lathonia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Microorganism","Dental_caries","Periodontal_disease","Microflora","Bacteria","Biofilm","Adhesion","Tooth","Epithelium","Dental_plaque","Anaerobe","Bacteroides","Spirochetes","Periodontal_diseases","ANUG","Biofilm","Adhesin","Quorum_sensing","Competence_stimulating_peptides","Autoinducer-2","Cariogenic","Human_flora","Biofilms","Environmental_microbiology","Human_microbiome_project","Microbiology"]}
