It is not\ncompletely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of\nparticles: predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as\nelectromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, and neutrinos. Observations have now\nrecently proven that it also contains dark matter and dark energy. The baseline\ntemperature, as set by the background radiation left over from the Big Bang, is\nonly 2.7 kelvin (K); in contrast, temperatures in the coronae of stars can\nreach over a million kelvin. Plasma with an extremely low density (less than one\nhydrogen atom per cubic meter) and high temperature (millions of kelvin) in the\nspace between galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in\nouter space; local concentrations have condensed into stars and galaxies.\nIntergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even\ngalaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.\n\nThere is no firm boundary where space begins. However the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line, at an\naltitude of above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space\nfor the purpose of space treaties and aerospace records keeping. The framework\nfor international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which was\npassed by the United Nations in 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of\nnational sovereignty and permits all states to explore outer space freely. In\n1979, the Moon Treaty made the surfaces of objects such as planets, as well as\nthe orbital space around these bodies, the jurisdiction of the international\ncommunity. Additional resolutions regarding the peaceful uses of outer space\nhave been drafted by the United Nations, but these have not precluded the\ndeployment of weapons into outer space, including the live testing of anti-\nsatellite weapons.\n\nHumans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the\nadvent of high-altitude balloon flights, followed by the development of single\nand multi-stage rocket launchers. Earth orbit was achieved by Yuri Gagarin in\n1961 and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the\nSolar System. Achieving low Earth orbit requires a minimum velocity of , much\nfaster than any conventional aircraft. Outer space represents a challenging\nenvironment for human exploration because of the dual hazards of vacuum and\nradiation. Microgravity has a deleterious effect on human physiology, resulting\nin muscle atrophy and bone loss. Space travel has so far been limited to low\nEarth orbit and the Moon for manned flight, and the vicinity of the Solar System\nfor unmanned; the remainder of outer space remains inaccessible to humans other\nthan by passive observation with telescopes.\n","linknr":1194,"url":"Outer_space","recorded":1362506362,"links":117,"instances":["classical_element","medical","medical","astronomy","astronomy","unit","physics","constellation","crater","aircraft","physics","electromagnetic_radiation","astronomy","astronomer","physics","mountain","astronomy","magazine"],"pdf":["http://www.athena-spu.gr/ftp/lfsc/Literature/Forbes_2007_DynamicsOfTheThermosphere.pdf","http://www.athena-spu.gr/ftp/lfsc/Literature/Forbes_2007_DynamicsOfTheThermosphere.pdf","http://www.ramcjournal.com/2011/mar11/hodkinson.pdf","http://www.ramcjournal.com/2011/mar11/hodkinson.pdf","http://terra.sgt-inc.com/pub/jmccarth/GEODYN_class/class_materials_DVD/references/4_yoder.pdf","http://terra.sgt-inc.com/pub/jmccarth/GEODYN_class/class_materials_DVD/references/4_yoder.pdf","http://ilwsonline.org/lwsgeospace_cospar.pdf","http://ilwsonline.org/lwsgeospace_cospar.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/25/46891645.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/25/46891645.pdf","http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-1999-208856.pdf","http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-1999-208856.pdf","http://deneb.ensc.sfu.ca/papers/sdc-91w.pdf","http://deneb.ensc.sfu.ca/papers/sdc-91w.pdf"],"categories":["Outer
