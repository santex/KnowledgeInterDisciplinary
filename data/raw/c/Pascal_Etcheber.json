{"cursor":"5948","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Infobox philosopher\n|\n| image = PascalEtcheber.jpg caption =\nManagement consultant, Philosopher, Writer }}\n\n'Pascal Etcheber' (born August 2, 1963) is a French author and philosopher. He\nco-edited âManaging Sensitive Projectsâ published by Macmillan in the UK and\nRoutledge in the US in 1998. In \"The Strength of Becoming: a philosophical\ntreatise on the new art & science of living\", Pascal Etcheber argues that there\nis a positive outlook in Existentialism through creating. Since only individuals\ncan bring meaning into the world âCreativismâ allows individuals to both find\nthemselves and fulfillment. His Philosophy is further outlined in âVagabond\nEarthâ (published by Substance Publishing in 2004). He purports that Human\nbeings are driven by three essential needs: Freedom, Actions and Ethics, that\nthe world is organized with Religions, Economics and Politics to apparently\nfulfill those needs. However, human beings can never find fulfillment because\nFreedom is lost by the obedience to laws; Actions are made useless by the belief\nthat this world is meaningless compared to a higher, spiritual world or\nafterlife; Ethics is never attained because participation in economics does not\nlead into abundance for all but the success of a few to the detriment of the\nmajority. âVagabond Earthâ proposes a blue print for a moneyless society of one\nworld with no governments with people actively engaged in making this world a\ngood place to live. In 2012, \"7 principles for an Economic Revolution\" marks a\nless utopian outlook and proposes new hopes for full employment and higher\nstandards of living, even in mature economies, despite globalization.\n\nThe British Philosophical Association listed Pascal Etcheber in their success\nstories as one of 38 people who graduated in Philosophy and achieved success in\ntheir subsequent careers. [http://www.bpa.ac.uk/resources/careers-and-success-\nstories Success stories]  He graduated in Philosophy with a Dean's\ncommendation from Exeter University in the UK. He also holds a diploma in\nEnglish Literature from Exeter University.\n\nPascal Etcheber is a Management consultant who has worked in 18 countries. He\nhas been an active speaker notably in the nuclear world to encourage the\nsuccessful development of difficult projects that are necessary. In 1999, he\nspoke at the Uranium Institute on âUnlocking local knowledge to benefit public\nacceptance workâ. [http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/1999/etchbio.htm World\nNuclear Symposium 1999] In 2003, he spoke at the World Nuclear Association\non âControversial projects can succeed in todayâs worldâ¦even from the brink of\ndefeatâ. http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2003/etcheber.htm[World Nuclear\nSymposium 2003]\n\nIn 2007, Pascal Etcheber wrote âFreeing the Organizationâ,a business book that\nexposes the myths of management consultants, uncovers the root causes of the\ninefficiencies crippling large organizations and explains how to overcome these\nissues quickly without large teams of consultants settling in. Pascal Etcheber,\na member of Mensa in France and in the UK, described a simplified method for\ncalculating any day of the Gregorian calendar explained in Determination of the\nday of the week [http://calculatingday.blogspot.fr/p/easy-method-for-calculating-\ndates-day.html Easy method for mentally calculating a date's day of the week in\nseconds]  and made available for free on scribd a knowledge acquisition\nmethod that is both fast, fun and effective in the practical guide entitled \"\nThe Hard Way or the Easy Way? Fast Fun Learning\" [http://www.scribd.com/doc/112781749/The-Hard-Way-or-the-Easy-Way-A-\nPractical-Guide-to-Fast-Fun-Learning] \n\nOn 18 March 2009, Pascal Etcheber was charged with making a false statement to\nthe FBI 18 months earlier. The Post and Courier reported the case on the front\npage over the 15 months court case. Officially, Pascal Etcheber was prosecuted\nfor his link to Thomas Ravenel. Unofficially, Pascal Etcheber was being\ninvestigated for being an agent of the French Secret Service. Eventually, all\ncharges against Pascal Etcheber were dismissed and he pleaded guilty to the fact\nthat a chef who was cooking for a party of 12 people in his house smoked a joint\nin the kitchen without his consent in the summer of 2004. After passing a\npolygraph test with the FBI, the prosecutor recognized in court that all\nNational security issues regarding Pascal Etcheber had been
