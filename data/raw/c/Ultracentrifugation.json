In the process, a tissue sample is first\nhomogenised to break the cell membranes and mix up the cell contents. The\nhomogenate is then subjected to repeated centrifugations, each time removing\nthe pellet and increasing the centrifugal force. Finally, purification may be\ndone through equilibrium sedimentation, and the desired layer is extracted for\nfurther analysis.\n\nSeparation is based on size and density, with larger and denser particles\npelleting at lower centrifugal forces. As an example, unbroken whole cells will\npellet at low speeds and short intervals such as 1,000g for 5 minutes. Smaller\ncell fragments and organelles remain in the supernatant and require more force\nand greater times to pellet. In general, one can enrich for the following cell\ncomponents, in the separating order in actual application: *Whole cells and\nnuclei; *Mitochondria, lysosomes and peroxisomes; *Microsomes (vesicles of\ndisrupted endoplasmic reticulum); and *Ribosomes and cytosol.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Ultracentrifugation","recorded":1362371320,"links":16,"instances":["vesicle","biology","device","biology","biology","fictitious"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell biology","Centrifugation","Industrial processes"],"headings":["Sample preparation","Ultracentrifugation","Techniques","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["homogenization","biology"],["centrifugal_force","fictitious"],["blender","device"],["vesicle","biology_and_chemistry#isolated_vesicles"],["exosome","vesicle"]],"members":["exosome","vesicle","homogenization","blender","tissue","cell","centrifugal_force"],"related":["Microbiology","Cell_biology","Organelle","Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(biology)","Homogenization_(biology)","Cell_membrane","Centrifugation","Centrifugal_force_(fictitious)","Equilibrium_sedimentation","Supernatant","Blender_(device)","Porcelain","Glass","Boiling_tube","Buffer_solution","Density","Inert","Aqueous_solution","Chemical_reaction","Osmosis","Sucrose","Brine","Ultracentrifuge","Sedimentation","Partial_specific_volume","Molecular_weight","Sedimentation_coefficient","Centrifugation","Isopycnic","G-force","Molar_concentration","Postsynaptic_density","Clathrin","Cesium_chloride","Sucrose","DNA","Caesium_chloride","Centrifuge","G-force","Diffusion","Adenine","Thymine","Guanine","Cytosine","DNA_supercoil","Plasmid","Centrifugation","Virus","Ribosome","Exosome_(vesicle)","Sucrose","Density_gradient","Buoyant_density_ultracentrifugation"]}
