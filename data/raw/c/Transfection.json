The term is used notably for non-viral methods in eukaryotic\ncells. http://www.promega.com/paguide/chap12.htm It may also refer to\nother methods and cell types, although other terms are preferred:\n\"transformation\" is more often used to describe non-viral DNA transfer in\nbacteria, non-animal eukaryotic cells and plant cells â a distinctive sense of\ntransformation refers to spontaneous genetic modifications (mutations to\ncancerous cells (carcinogenesis), or under stress (UV irradiation)).\nTransduction is often used to describe virus-mediated DNA transfer. The word\ntransfection is a blend of trans- and infection.\n\nGenetic material (such as supercoiled plasmid DNA or siRNA constructs), or even\nproteins such as antibodies, may be transfected.\n\nTransfection of animal cells typically involves opening transient pores or\n\"holes\" in the cell membrane, to allow the uptake of material. Transfection can\nbe carried out using calcium phosphate, by electroporation, or by mixing a\ncationic lipid with the material to produce liposomes, which fuse with the cell\nmembrane and deposit their cargo inside.\n\nTransfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in\ntarget cells.\n","linknr":372,"url":"Transfection","recorded":1362481366,"links":25,"instances":["genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Gene delivery"],"headings":["Terminology","Methods","Stable and transient transfection","RNA transfection","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transformation","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["transduction","genetics"],["transformation","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"]],"members":["transduction","cell","transformation"],"related":["Transformation_(genetics)","DNA","Bacteria","Eukaryote","Mutation","Carcinogenesis","Transduction_(genetics)","Blend","Genetics","DNA_supercoil","SiRNA","Protein","Antibodies","Animal_cell","Plasma_membrane","Calcium_phosphate","Electroporation","Cationic","Lipid","Liposomes","Prokaryote","Bacteriophage","DNA","Cell_(biology)","Cyclodextrin","HEPES","Calcium_chloride","Dendrimers","Cell_membrane","Lipofection","DEAE","Polyethylenimine","Polycation","Endocytosis","Electroporation","Gene_electrotransfer","Sonoporation","Optical_transfection","Impalefection","Hydrodynamic_delivery","Plasmids","Transposons","Nanoparticle","Inert","Cell_nucleus","Magnetofection","Magnet_assisted_transfection","Impalefection","Carbon_nanofibers","Silicon","Nanowires","Plasmid","DNA","Virus","Transduction_(genetics)","Nucleofection","Heat_shock","Mitosis","Marker_gene","Toxin","Cell_proliferation","Geneticin","Neomycin","SiRNA","Gene_knockdown","Protofection","Transformation_(genetics)","Transduction_(genetics)","Cationic_liposome","Nucleofection","Magnet_assisted_transfection","Impalefection"]}
