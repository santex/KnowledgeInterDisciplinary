It is distinguished from a gear in that sprockets are never\n| meshed together directly, and differs from a pulley in that sprockets have\n| teeth and pulleys are smooth.\n\nSprockets are used in bicycles, motorcycles, cars, tracked vehicles, and other\nmachinery either to transmit rotary motion between two shafts where gears are\nunsuitable or to impart linear motion to a track, tape etc. Perhaps the\ncommonest form of sprocket is found in the bicycle, in which the pedal shaft\ncarries a large sprocket-wheel which drives a chain which in turn drives a small\nsprocket on the axle of the rear wheel. Early automobiles were also largely\ndriven by sprocket and chain mechanism, a practice largely copied from bicycles.\n\nSprockets are of various designs, a maximum of efficiency being claimed for each\nby its originator. Sprockets typically do not have a flange. Some sprockets used\nwith timing belts have flanges to keep the timing belt centered. Sprockets and\nchains are also used for power transmission from one shaft to another where\nslippage is not admissible, sprocket chains being used instead of belts or ropes\nand sprocket-wheels instead of pulleys. They can be run at high speed and some\nforms of chain are so constructed as to be noiseless even at high speed.\n","linknr":263,"url":"Sprocket","recorded":1362476864,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bicycle parts","Gears","Mechanical power transmission","Mechanical power control","Motorcycle transmissions"],"headings":["Transportation","Tracked vehicles","Film and paper","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Sprocket16.png/220px-Sprocket16.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Chain.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Leclerc_p1040882.jpg/220px-Leclerc_p1040882.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Optic_Projection_fig_226.jpg/220px-Optic_Projection_fig_226.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Bicycle_diagram-en.svg/150px-Bicycle_diagram-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Oxford_English_Dictionary","Wheel","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Roller_chain","Caterpillar_track","Gear","Pulley","Bicycle","Motorcycle","Automobile","Continuous_track","Machine","Flange","Timing_belt","Gear_ratio","Bicycle_chain","Derailleur_gears","Acceleration","Speed","Gear_ratio","Caterpillar_tracks","Movie_projector","Movie_camera","Film_perforations","Film","Punched_tape","Paper","Computer_printer","Roller_chain","Rack_and_pinion","Toothed_belt","Gear_train","Gear_ratio","Chain_drive","Bicycle_chain","Mechanical_advantage"]}
