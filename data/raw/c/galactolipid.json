They're\ndifferent from glycosphingolipids in that they do not have nitrogen in their\ncomposition.\n\nThey are the main part of plant membrane lipids where they substitute\nphospholipids to conserve phosphate for other essential processes. These\nchloroplast membranes contain a high quantity of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol\n(MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG).\n\nThey probably also assume a direct role in photosynthesis, as they have been\nfound in the X-ray structures of photosynthetic complexes. {{Cite journal\n  | last = DÃ¶rmann first = Peter authorlink = coauthors = Christoph Benning\n  | title = Galactolipids rule in seed plants journal = Trends in Plant Science\n  | volume = 7 issue = 3 pages = 112â118 publisher = location = date = 1 March\n  | 2002 url =\n\n  | pmid = 11906834| doi = 10.1016/S1360-1385(01)02216-6 id = }}\n\nThe galactolipid galactocerebroside (GalC) and its sulfated derivative sulfatide\nis also in abundance present (together with a small group of proteins) in\nmyelin, the membrane around the axons in the nervous system of vertebrates.\n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Coet first = Tomthy authorlink = coauthors = Kunihiko Suzukia, Brian\n  | Popkoa, Kunihiko Suzukib, Brian Popkoc, Kunihiko Suzukid and Brian Popko\n  | title = New perspectives on the function of myelin galactolipids journal =\n  | Trends in Neurosciences volume = 21 issue = 3 pages = 126â130 publisher =\n  | location = date = 1 March 1998 url =\n\n  | pmid = 9530920| doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01178-8 id = }}\n\nIt is galactolipids, rather than phlorotannins, that act as herbivore deterrents\nin [[Fucus vesiculosus]] against the sea urchin [[Arbacia\npunctulata]].
