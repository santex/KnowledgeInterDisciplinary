Because the pancreas is a vital organ, performing functions necessary\nin the digestion process, the recipient's native pancreas is left in place, and\nthe donated pancreas is attached in a different location. In the event of\nrejection of the new pancreas which would quickly cause life-threatening\ndiabetes, the recipient could not survive without the native pancreas still in\nplace. The healthy pancreas comes from a donor who has just died or it may be a\npartial pancreas from a living donor. [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part3/section-\n14.html Type 1 cures - pancreas transplants ]\nAt present, pancreas transplants are usually performed in persons with insulin-\ndependent diabetes, who can develop severe complications. Patients with\npancreatic cancer are not eligible for valuable pancreatic transplantations,\nsince the condition has a very high mortality rate and the disease, being highly\nmalignant, could and probably would soon return.\n","linknr":383,"url":"Pancreas_transplant","recorded":1362482015,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organ transplants","Accessory digestive gland surgery"],"headings":["Types","Indications","Preservation until implantation","Complications","Prognosis","History","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Organ_transplant","Pancreas","Diabetes","Pancreatic_cancer","Hypoglycemia","Diabetes","Renal_disease","Viaspan","Histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate","Thrombosis","Pancreatitis","Infection","Transplant_rejection","Immunosuppressive_drug","Ciclosporin","Azathioprine","Corticosteroid","Tacrolimus","Mycophenolic_acid","Immunosuppression"]}
