It was introduced in Victorian schools in 1995 and\nrepublished in 2000 as the CSF II. It was superseded by the Victorian Essential\nLearning Standards (VELS) program in 2006.\n\nThe CSF described what students in Victorian schools should know and be able to\ndo in eight key areas of learning at regular intervals from the primary and\nsecondary levels of education â specifically, from year Prep ('Preparatory') to\nYear 10. It provided sufficient detail for schools and the community to be clear\nabout the major elements of the curriculum and the standards expected of\nsuccessful learners.\n\nThe eight key learning areas were the Arts, English, Health and Physical\nEducation, Languages Other Than English (LOTE), Mathematics, Science, Studies of\nSociety and Environment (SOSE) and Technology. A document, the ESL Companion to\nthe English CSF was also part of the project - it describes stages of English as\na second language development. This latter document was an important part of the\ncsf, acknowledging the teaching and assessment needs of the many students\nlearning English as a second or additional language.\n","linknr":89,"url":"Curriculum_and_Standards_Framework","recorded":1362673870,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Curricula","Education in Victoria (Australia)"],"headings":["VELS to replace CSF","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Victoria,_Australia","Victorian_Essential_Learning_Standards","Primary_Education","Secondary_Education","Curriculum","The_Arts","English_studies","Health_and_Physical_Education","Languages_Other_Than_English","Mathematics","Science","Studies_of_Society_and_Environment","Technology","Victorian_Essential_Learning_Standards","Educational_assessment","Education_in_Victoria","Victorian_Curriculum_and_Assessment_Authority"]}
