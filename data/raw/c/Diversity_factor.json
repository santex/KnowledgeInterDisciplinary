{"cursor":"4782","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues|confusing = December 2006|\n\n}}\n\n'Diversity factor' (or simultaneity factor  k_\\text{s} ) is a\nmeasure of the probability that a particular piece of equipment will come on\ncoincidentally to another piece of equipment. For aggregate systems it is\ndefined as the ratio of the sum of the individual non-coincident maximum\nloads of various subdivisions of the system to the maximum demand of the\ncomplete system.\n\n f_{Diversity} = \\frac{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n\\text{Max}(\\text{Load}_i)}{\\su-\nm\\limits_{i=1}^n\\text{Load}_i}\n\nThe diversity factor is almost always greater than 1 since all components would\nhave to be on simultaneously at full load for it to be one. The aggregate load\n\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n\\text{Load}_i \\right) is time dependent\nas well as being dependent upon equipment characteristics. The diversity factor\nrecognizes that the whole load does not equal the sum of its parts due to this\ntime interdependence (i.e. diverseness). For example, we might have ten air\nconditioning units that are 20 tons each at a facility. In Florida we typically\nassume that the average full load equivalent operating hours for the units are\n2000 hours per year. However, since the units are each thermostatically\ncontrolled, we do not know exactly when each unit turns on. If the ten units are\nsubstantially bigger than the facility's actual peak A/C load, then fewer than\nall ten units will likely come on at once. Thus, even though each unit runs a\ntotal of 2000 hours a year, they do not all come on at the same time to affect\nthe facility's peak load. The diversity factor gives us a correction factor to\nuse, which results in a lower total kW load for the ten A/C units. If the energy\nbalance we do for this facility comes out within reason, but the demand balance\nshows far too many kW for the peak load, then we can use the diversity factor to\nbring the kW into line with the facility's true peak load. The diversity factor\ndoes not affect the kWh; it only affects the kW.\n","linknr":204,"url":"Diversity_factor","recorded":1362539623,"links":21,"instances":["electrical"],"pdf":["http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//PDF/necdigest/CodeIssues072704.pdf"],"categories":["Electricity"],"headings":["Coincidence factor","Diversity","Diversified Load","In mathematics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Ambox_wikify.svg/40px-Ambox_wikify.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/4/5/d45793917f5fa336b89c7d536cd207b9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/f/a/6fa0baa879dcf8326193af42565badcc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/3/8/538d756fd178cf999a967142f483f1bf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/e/7/ce76902e5d3323a8a58c2bac2eedeb95.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Powerplant_icon.svg/30px-Powerplant_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["load_factor","electrical"]],"members":["load_factor"],"related":["Ratio","Interdependence","A/C","KW","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","Energy_storage","Intermittent_power_source","Demand_factor","Load_factor_(electrical)","Utilization_factor"]}
