{"cursor":"12897","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Continuous reactors' (alternatively referred to as 'flow reactors') carry\nmaterial as a flowing stream. Reactants are continuously fed into the reactor\nand emerge as continuous stream of product. Continuous reactors are used for a\nwide variety of chemical and biological processes within the food, chemical and\npharmaceutical industries. A survey of the continuous reactor market will throw\nup a daunting variety of shapes and types of machine. Beneath this variation\nhowever lies a relatively small number of key design features which determine\nthe capabilities of the reactor. When classifying continuous reactors, it can be\nmore helpful to look at these design features rather than the whole system.\n\nAs with any type of process equipment, the purpose of classification is to\nensure that the best tool is used for the job. It is therefore important to\nrecognise that continuous reactors are part of a larger equipment group which\nalso includes batch reactors. The merits of batch reactors should therefore not\nbe ignored when looking for the optimum solution to a process problem. For this\nreason, the subject is introduced with a brief summary of the merits of both\nbatch and continuous reactors.\n","linknr":140,"url":"Continuous_reactor","recorded":1362500414,"links":21,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical reactors"],"headings":["Batch versus continuous","Heat transfer capacity","Temperature control","Mixing","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fc/Continuous_reactor_hot_spot.png/109px-Continuous_reactor_hot_spot.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/Continuous_reactor_cold_zone.png/91px-Continuous_reactor_cold_zone.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/28/Micro_continuous_reactor_control.png/95px-Micro_continuous_reactor_control.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/Tube.reactor2.jpg/120px-Tube.reactor2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/Static.mixer.jpg/120px-Static.mixer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/OBR.png/120px-OBR.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["yield","chemistry"]],"members":["yield"],"related":["Reactant","Chemical_reaction","Biological_process","Food_industry","Chemical_industry","Pharmaceutical_industry","Batch_reactor","Distillation","Crystallisation","Liquid-liquid_extraction","Slurry","Rate_of_reaction","Concentration","Heat_transfer","Yield_(chemistry)","Exothermic","Endothermic","Flow_conditioning_"]}
