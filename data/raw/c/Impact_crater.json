{"cursor":"31921","size":15,"audio":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Impact_movie.ogg"],"currentlang":"en","article":" on the Moon.]] An 'impact crater' is an approximately circular depression in\n the surface of a planet, moon or other solid body in the Solar System, formed\n by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body with the surface. In contrast to\n volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal\n collapse, Basaltic Volcanism Study Project. (1981). Basaltic Volcanism on\n the Terrestrial Planets; Pergamon Press, Inc: New York, p. 746. http://article-\n s.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/book/bvtp./1981//0000746.000.html. impact\n craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than\n the surrounding terrain. Consolmagno, G.J.; Schaefer, M.W. (1994). Worlds\n Apart: A Textbook in Planetary Sciences; Prentice Hall: Englewood Cliffs, NJ,\n p.56. Impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to\n large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-\n known example of a small impact crater on the Earth.\n\nImpact craters are the dominant geographic features on many solid Solar System\nobjects including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede and most small moons and\nasteroids. On other planets and moons that experience more active surface\ngeological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io and Titan, visible\nimpact craters are less common because they become eroded, buried or transformed\nby tectonics over time. Where such processes have destroyed most of the original\ncrater topography, the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly\nused. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was\nwidely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were\noften used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on\nEarth. French, B.M. (1998). [[Traces of Catastrophe]]: A Handbook of Shock-\nMetamorphic Effects in Terrestrial Meteorite Impact Structures; Simthsonian\nInstitution: Washington DC, p. 97. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/CB-\n954.intro.html.\n\nThe cratering records of very old surfaces, such as Mercury, the Moon, and the\nsouthern highlands of Mars, record a period of intense early bombardment in the\ninner Solar System around 3.9 billion years ago. Since that time, the rate of\ncrater production on Earth has been considerably lower, but it is appreciable\nnonetheless; Earth experiences from one to three impacts large enough to produce\na 20 km diameter crater about once every million years on\naverage. Carr, M.H. (2006) The surface of Mars; Cambridge University Press:\nCambridge, UK, p. 23. Grieve R.A.; Shoemaker, E.M. (1994). The Record\nof Past Impacts on Earth in Hazards due to Comets and Asteroids, T. Gehrels,\nEd.; University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ, pp. 417-464. This indicates\nthat there should be far more relatively young craters on the planet than have\nbeen discovered so far. The cratering rate in the inner solar system fluctuates\nas a consequence of collisions in the asteroid belt that create a family of\nfragments that are often sent cascading into the inner solar system. Formed in a collision 160 million years ago, the\nBaptistina family of asteroids is thought to have caused a large spike in the\nimpact rate, perhaps causing the Chicxulub impact that may have triggered the\nextinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.\n\nAlthough the Earthâs active surface processes quickly destroy the impact record,\nabout 170 terrestrial impact craters have been identified. Grieve, R.A.F.;\nCintala, M.J.; Tagle, R. (2007). Planetary Impacts in Encyclopedia of the Solar\nSystem, 2nd ed., L-A. McFadden et al. Eds, p. 826. These range in diameter\nfrom a few tens of meters up to about 300 km, and they range in age from\nrecent times (e.g. the Sikhote-Alin craters in Russia whose creation were\nwitnessed in 1947) to more than two billion years, though most are less than 500\nmillion years old because geological processes tend to obliterate older craters.\nThey are also selectively found in the stable interior regions of\ncontinents. Shoemaker, E.M.; Shoemaker, C.S. (1999). The Role of Collisions\nin The New Solar System, 4th ed., J.K. Beatty et al., Eds., p. 73. Few\nundersea craters have been discovered because of the difficulty of surveying the\nsea floor, the rapid rate of change of the ocean bottom, and the subduction of\nthe ocean floor into the Earth's interior by processes of plate tectonics.\n\nImpact craters are not to be confused with landforms that in some cases appear\nsimilar, including calderas and ring dikes.\n","linknr":635,"url":"Impact_crater","recorded":1362900481,"links":91,"instances":["crater","moon","moon","mimantean_crater","moon","crater","solar","crater","crater","moon","moon","crater","geologist","crater","crater","moon","crater","crater","crater","crater","crater","crater","crater","crater","crater","geology","crater","crater","unit","crater","physical","crater","crater","crater","crater","crater","tajikistan","mars","crater","moon","crater","crater","hypothetical_star","lunar_crater","moon","martian_crater","planet"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Impact
