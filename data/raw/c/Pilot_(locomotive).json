In\nsome countries it is also called 'cowcatcher' or 'cattle catcher'.\n\nIn addition to the pilot, small metal bars called life-guards, rail guards or\n(UK) guard irons are provided immediately in front of the wheels. They knock\naway smaller obstacles lying directly on the running surface of the railhead.\nHistorically fenced-off railway systems in Europe relied exclusively on these\ndevices and forwent the use of pilots, but this design is rarely used in\nmodern systems.\n\nTrams use in place of the pilot a device called a 'fender'. Objects lying on the\ntram track get hit by a sensor bracket, which triggers the lowering of a basket\nshaped device to the ground preventing overrunning of the obstacles by dragging\nit along the road surface in front of the wheels.\n\nIn snowy areas the pilot has also the function of a snowplow.\n","linknr":148,"url":"Pilot_(locomotive)","recorded":1362576210,"links":21,"instances":["railway","rail","railway"],"pdf":[],"categories":["English inventions","Locomotive parts","Train protection systems"],"headings":["Invention","Design","Modern pilots","Anti-climbers","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/John_Bull.jpg/220px-John_Bull.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Indian_Railways_WAG-9_31054.jpg/220px-Indian_Railways_WAG-9_31054.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/1911_Baldwin_2-8-0_Steam_at_Texas_Transportation_museum_3.jpg/220px-1911_Baldwin_2-8-0_Steam_at_Texas_Transportation_museum_3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Lifeguard_on_Class_43_powercar.jpg/220px-Lifeguard_on_Class_43_powercar.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/June_22%2C_2009_WMATA_Collision_-_NTSB_accident_photo_439411.jpg/220px-June_22%2C_2009_WMATA_Collision_-_NTSB_accident_photo_439411.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coupling","railway"],["passenger_car","rail"],["passenger_car","rail"],["telescoping","railway"]],"members":["telescoping","passenger_car","coupling"],"related":["Railroad","Locomotive","Derailment","Tram","Charles_Babbage","Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway","Steam_locomotive","Coupling_(railway)","Shunting_locomotive","Europe","Diesel_locomotive","June_2009_Washington_Metro_train_collision","Locomotive","Passenger_car_(rail)","Passenger_car_(rail)","Telescoping_(railway)","Train_wreck","Buffer_stop"]}
