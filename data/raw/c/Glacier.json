At in length, it is one of the\n longest alpine glaciers on earth.]] from the terminus of the Perito Moreno\n Glacier, in western Patagonia, Argentina]] , the largest glacier of the Alps,\n in Switzerland]] , is the largest glaciated area in the tropics, in Peru]]\n\nA 'glacier' ( or ) is a large persistent body of ice that forms where the\naccumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many\nyears, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced\nby their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features.\nThey also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such\nas cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the\nmuch thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.\n\nOn Earth, 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar\nregions, but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges of every continent, and on\na few high-latitude oceanic islands. Between 35Â°N and 35Â°S, glaciers occur only\nin the Himalayas, Andes, a few high mountains in East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea\nand on Zard Kuh in Iran.\n\nGlacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth, supporting one\nthird of the world's population. Many glaciers store\nwater during one season and release it later as meltwater, a water source\nthat is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other\nsources may be scant.\n\nBecause glacial mass is affected by long-term climate changes, e.g.,\nprecipitation, mean temperature, and cloud cover, glacial mass changes are\nconsidered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change and are a major\nsource of variations in sea level.\n","linknr":998,"url":"Glacier","recorded":1362511465,"links":140,"instances":["geology","landform","geology","glaciation","glacier","geology","physics","phase_transition","meteorology","landform","island","geology"],"pdf":["http://folk.uio.no/kaeaeb/publications/grl04_paul.pdf","http://folk.uio.no/kaeaeb/publications/grl04_paul.pdf","http://earth.esa.int/pub/ESA_DOC/gothenburg/154stroz.pdf","http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~vtsai/files/EkstromNettlesTsai_Science2006.pdf","http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~vtsai/files/TsaiEkstrom_JGR2007.pdf","http://www.easternsnow.org/proceedings/2004/kincaid_and_klein.pdf","http://www.easternsnow.org/proceedings/2004/kincaid_and_klein.pdf","http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/KChauff/earth_history/4EH-posted.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/polar2003/pdf/8112.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/polar2003/pdf/8112.pdf"],"categories":["Glaciology","Glaciers|","Bodies
