For\nexample: Suchocki, John. Conceptual Chemistry, 2007. Page\n119.\n\n â +\n\nBecause an alpha particle is the same as a helium-4 nucleus, which has mass\nnumber 4 and atomic number 2, this can also be written as:\n\n â +\n\nThe alpha particle also has a charge +2, but the charge is usually not written\nin nuclear equations, which describe nuclear reactions without considering the\nelectrons. This convention is not meant to imply that the nuclei necessarily\noccur in neutral atoms.\n\nAlpha decay is by far the most common form of cluster decay where the parent\natom ejects a defined daughter collection of nucleons, leaving another defined\nproduct behind (in nuclear fission, a number of different pairs of daughters of\napproximately equal size are formed). Alpha decay is the most likely cluster\ndecay because of the combined extremely high binding energy and relatively small\nmass of the helium-4 product nucleus (the alpha particle).\n\nAlpha decay, like other cluster decays, is fundamentally a quantum tunneling\nprocess. Unlike beta decay, alpha decay is governed by the interplay between the\nnuclear force and the electromagnetic force.\n\nAlpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. In theory it can occur\nonly in nuclei somewhat heavier than nickel (element 28), where overall binding\nenergy per nucleon is no longer a minimum, and the nuclides are therefore\nunstable toward spontaneous fission-type processes. In practice, this mode of\ndecay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel, with\nthe lightest known alpha emitter being the lightest isotopes (mass numbers\n106â110) of tellurium (element 52).\n\nAlpha particles have a typical kinetic energy of 5 MeV (that is,\nâ 0.13% of their total energy, i.e. 110 TJ/kg) and a speed of\n15,000 km/s. This corresponds to a speed of around 0.05 [[Speed of\nlight|c]]. There is surprisingly small variation around this energy, due to the\nheavy dependence of the half-life of this process on the energy produced (see\nequations in the GeigerâNuttall law).\n\nBecause of their relatively large mass, +2 electric charge and relatively low\nvelocity, alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose\ntheir energy, so their forward motion is effectively stopped within a few\ncentimeters of air.\n\nMost of the helium produced on Earth (approximately 99% of it) is the result of\nthe alpha decay of underground deposits of minerals containing uranium or\nthorium. The helium is brought to the surface as a byproduct of natural gas\nproduction.\n","linknr":344,"url":"Alpha_decay","recorded":1362375507,"links":60,"instances":["chemistry","skin"],"pdf":["http://www.ct.infn.it/~rivel/Didat/SilDet.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear physics","Radioactivity"],"headings":["History","Uses","Toxicity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Alpha_Decay.svg/240px-Alpha_Decay.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/NuclearReaction.png/200px-NuclearReaction.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Alphaspektroskopie.JPG/220px-Alphaspektroskopie.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Ndslivechart.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["epidermis","skin"],["heavy_metal","chemistry"]],"members":["heavy_metal","epidermis"],"related":["Radioactivity","Atomic_nucleus","Alpha_particle","Mass_number","Atomic_number","Alpha_particle","Helium-4","Atomic_nucleus","Mass_number","Atomic_number","Cluster_decay","Atom","Decay_product","Nucleon","Nuclear_fission","Binding_energy","Quantum_tunneling","Beta_decay","Nuclear_force","Electromagnetic_force","Binding_energy","Isotope","Tellurium","Alpha_particles","Geiger–Nuttall_law","Electric_charge","Air","Helium","Earth","Mineral","Uranium","Thorium","Natural_gas","Ernest_Rutherford","George_Gamow","Potential_well","Quantum_mechanics","Quantum_tunnelling","Potential_barrier","Half-life","Geiger–Nuttall_law","Americium-241","Alpha_emitter","Smoke_detector","Ionization","Electric_current","Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator","Space_probe","Artificial_pacemaker","Plutonium-238","Lead","Static_eliminator","Polonium-210","Mean_free_path","MeV","Epidermis_(skin)","Beta_decay","Equivalent_dose","Relative_biological_effectiveness","Cancer","Necrosis","Linear_energy_transfer","Angstrom","Neutron","Beta_decay","Recoil","Conservation_of_momentum","Ionizing_radiation","Atomic_mass_unit","Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","Chromosome","New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Radon","Marie_Curie","Leukemia","Beta_decay","Gamma_ray","Alexander_Litvinenko","Radiation_poisoning","Polonium-210","Alpha_particle","Beta_decay"]}
