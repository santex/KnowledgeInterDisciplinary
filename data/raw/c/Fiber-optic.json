The yellow cables are single mode fibers; the orange and blue cables are multi-\n  mode fibers: 50/125 Âµm OM2 and 50/125 Âµm OM3 fibers respectively.]]\n\nAn 'optical fiber' (or 'optical fibre') is a flexible, transparent fiber made of\nglass (silica) or plastic, slightly thicker than a human hair. It functions as a\nwaveguide, or âlight pipeâ, [http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/light-\npipe.html Light Pipe] entry at the Jargon File to transmit light between\nthe two ends of the fiber. The field of applied science and\nengineering concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known\nas 'fiber optics'. Optical fibers are widely used in fiber-optic communications,\nwhich permits transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data\nrates) than other forms of communication. Fibers are used instead of metal wires\nbecause signals travel along them with less loss and are also immune to\nelectromagnetic interference. Fibers are also used for illumination, and are\nwrapped in bundles so that they may be used to carry images, thus allowing\nviewing in confined spaces. Specially designed fibers are used for a variety of\nother applications, including sensors and fiber lasers.\n\nOptical fibers typically include a transparent core surrounded by a transparent\ncladding material with a lower index of refraction. Light is kept in the core by\ntotal internal reflection. This causes the fiber to act as a waveguide. Fibers\nthat support many propagation paths or transverse modes are called multi-mode\nfibers (MMF), while those that only support a single mode are called single-mode\nfibers (SMF). Multi-mode fibers generally have a wider core diameter, and are\nused for short-distance communication links and for applications where high\npower must be transmitted. Single-mode fibers are used for most communication\nlinks longer than .\n\nJoining lengths of optical fiber is more complex than joining electrical wire or\ncable. The ends of the fibers must be carefully cleaved, and then spliced\ntogether, either mechanically or by fusing them with heat. Special optical fiber\nconnectors for removable connections are also available.\n","linknr":1479,"url":"Fiber-optic","recorded":1362501658,"links":119,"instances":["optical_fiber","optics","materials_science","optics","optical_fiber","fiber_optics","periodic_table","waves","chemistry","sofia","optics","lighting","fiber","mechanics","fiber_optics","semiconductor","optics","electromagnetic_radiation","optics","electronics","electrical","computing","physics","chemistry","waves","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/sciback_phy_09.pdf","http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/MSC-SESD-28-105.pdf","http://www.generalphotonics.com/pdf/PSReprint.pdf","http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/SP5619.pdf","http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/SP5619.pdf","http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/amlab1002.pdf","http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/amlab1002.pdf","http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/2703_o.pdf","http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/2703_o.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060508191931/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf","http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060508191931/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf","http://www.furukawa.co.jp/review/fr024/fr24_04.pdf","http://www.furukawa.co.jp/review/fr024/fr24_04.pdf","http://spie.org/Documents/Publications/00%20STEP%20Module%2007.pdf"],"categories":["Optical
