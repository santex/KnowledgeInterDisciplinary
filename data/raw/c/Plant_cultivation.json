It is practiced from the individual level in a\ngarden up to the activities of a multinational corporation. It is very diverse\nin its activities, incorporating plants for food (fruits, vegetables, mushrooms,\nculinary herbs) and non-food crops (flowers, trees and shrubs, turf-grass, hops,\nmedicinal herbs). It also includes related services in plant conservation,\nlandscape restoration, landscape and garden design/construction/maintenance,\nhorticultural therapy, and much more. This range of food, medicinal,\nenvironmental, and social products and services are all fundamental to\ndeveloping and maintaining human health and well-being.

Ad Hoc Committee for Global Horticulture Advocacy. Editor: Dr Owen\nDoyle University College Dublin Ireland. Feb. 2012.\n\nHorticulturists apply the knowledge, skills, and technologies used to grow\nintensively produced plants for human food and non-food uses and for personal or\nsocial needs. Their work involves plant propagation and cultivation with the aim\nof improving plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to\ninsects, diseases, and environmental stresses. They work as gardeners, growers,\ntherapists, designers, and technical advisors in the food and non-food sectors\nof horticulture.\n\nHorticultural scientists focus on the research that underpins horticultural\nknowledge, skills, technologies, education, and commerce. Horticultural science\nencompasses all of the pure sciences â mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology,\nand biology â as well as related sciences and technologies that underpin\nhorticulture, such as plant pathology, soil science, entomology, weed science,\nand many other scientific disciplines. It also includes the social sciences,\nsuch as education, commerce, marketing, healthcare and therapies that enhance\nhorticulture's contribution to society.\n\nA gardener is a person that tends to a garden and is therefore a horticulturist.\nHowever, not all horticulturists are gardeners.\n","linknr":423,"url":"Plant_cultivation","recorded":1362480708,"links":47,"instances":["horticulture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Horticulture and gardening|","Agronomy"],"headings":["Etymology","Understanding horticulture","Areas of study","Anthropology","Horticulture organisations","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Fruit_and_Vegetable_Market.jpg/220px-Fruit_and_Vegetable_Market.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Photograph_of_a_Vertical_Garden.jpg/220px-Photograph_of_a_Vertical_Garden.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Image_of_fresh_produce_on_display.jpg/220px-Image_of_fresh_produce_on_display.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Veranotrigo.jpg/32px-Veranotrigo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/RegaderaMetalica.jpg/100px-RegaderaMetalica.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Corn_01.JPG/16px-Corn_01.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Leaf_1_web.jpg/16px-Leaf_1_web.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plug","horticulture"]],"members":["plug"],"related":["Science","Technology","Business","Plant","Human","Fruit","Vegetable","Mushroom","Herb","Flower","Tree","Shrub","Participle","Cognate","Arboriculture","Turf_management","Floriculture","Landscape_architecture","Olericulture","Vegetable","Pomology","Pome","Viticulture","Grapes","Oenology","Wine","Winemaking","Postharvest_physiology","Leaf_decomposition","Permaculture","Biology","Botany","Entomology","Chemistry","Geography","Mathematics","Genetics","Physiology","Statistics","Computer_science","Communication_studies","Garden_design","Planting_design","Botany","Plant_propagation","Post-harvest_handling","Plant_breeding","Pollination_management","Entomology","Phytopathology","Cyrus_the_Great","Luther_Burbank","Hunter-gatherer","Milpa","Mesoamerican","Terra_preta","Swidden","Slash_and_burn","Hunter-gatherer","Plains_Indians","Maya_civilization","Papaya","Avocado","Theobroma_cacao","Ceiba","Sapodilla","Floriculture","Forest_gardening","Genomics_of_domestication","Hoe-farming","Horticultural_botany","Horticultural_flora","Horticultural_oil","Horticultural_therapy","Indigenous_horticulture","Landscaping","Permaculture","Plant_nutrition","Plug_(horticulture)","Tropical_horticulture","Turf_management","Vertical_farming"]}
