It was founded in 1830 by Father James Ryder, S.J., in whose honor\nan award is given every Spring at the Merrick Debate. The Philodemic is among\nthe oldest such societies in the United States, and is\nthe oldest secular student organization at Georgetown. The society's\nmotto, \"{{lang|la|Eloquentiam Libertati Devinctam}}\" reminds its members that\nthey are pursuing Eloquence in Defense of Liberty. After\na period of inactivity beginning in 1970, the society was restored by students\nin 1989.\n\nDebates are held weekly on Thursdays at 8pm in the Philodemic Room in Healy\nHall. The society generally operates as the school's debate\nteam, and in recent years, the Philodemic has taken a more active role in\nengaging other prominent debating societies on the Eastern seaboard.\nThe Philodemic participates in the Winchester Cup, an annual competition with\nthe Jefferson Literary and Debating Society of the University of Virginia, and\nthe Columbia Cup, a debate with the Enosinian Society of The George Washington\nUniversity before they became defunct in 2010. Additionally, the Philodemic\nmaintains an intercollegiate friendship with the Demosthenian Literary Society\nof The University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia and the Philomathean Society of\nthe University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Philodemic_Society","recorded":1362538415,"links":15,"instances":["american_politician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organizations established in 1830","Georgetown University student organizations","Student debating societies","College literary societies in the United States"],"headings":["History","Debates","Notable Philodemicians","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2a/Philodemic.jpg/150px-Philodemic.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["georgia","u.s._state"],["robert_mcclelland","american_politician"]],"members":["robert_mcclelland","georgia"],"related":["Latin","Healy_Hall","Georgetown_University","Washington,_D.C.","USA","Georgetown_University","Healy_Hall","Jefferson_Literary_and_Debating_Society","University_of_Virginia","Enosinian_Society","The_George_Washington_University","Demosthenian_Literary_Society","University_of_Georgia","Athens,_Georgia","Georgia_(U.S._state)","Philomathean_Society","University_of_Pennsylvania","Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","List_of_Presidents_of_Georgetown_University","Maryland_Day","St._Mary's_City,_Maryland","Lauinger_Library","Martin's_Tavern","Wisconsin_Avenue","Edward_Douglass_White","Cond√©_Montrose_Nast","Philip_Hart","Antonin_Scalia","Robert_Shrum","Francis_Keating","George_Washington_Parke_Custis","William_Gaston","Ulysses_S._Grant","James_Hoban","Andrew_Jackson","Robert_E._Lee","Robert_McClelland_(American_politician)","Franklin_Pierce","William_Winston_Seaton","Zachary_Taylor"]}
