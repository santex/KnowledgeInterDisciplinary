{"cursor":"64710","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn cosmology, 'cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation' (also 'CMBR', 'CBR',\n'MBR', and 'relic radiation') is thermal radiation filling the observable\nuniverse almost uniformly. \n\nWith a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the\nbackground) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio\ntelescope shows a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all\ndirections, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This\nglow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The CMB's\nserendipitous discovery in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and\nRobert Wilson  was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s,\nand earned them the 1978 Nobel Prize.\n\nCosmic background radiation is well explained as radiation left over from an\nearly stage in the development of the universe, and its discovery is considered\na landmark test of the Big Bang model of the universe. When the universe was\nyoung, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter,\nand filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the\nuniverse expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler.\nWhen the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral\natoms. These atoms could no longer absorb the thermal radiation, and so the\nuniverse became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer\nto the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the [[Recombination\n(cosmology)|recombination]] epoch, and the event shortly afterwards when photons\nstarted to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by\nelectrons and protons in plasma is referred to as photon decoupling. The photons\nthat existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since,\nthough growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes\ntheir wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional\nto energy according to Planck's relation). This is the source of the alternative\nterm relic radiation. The surface of last scattering refers to the set of points\nin space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons\noriginally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.\n\nPrecise measurements of cosmic background radiation are critical to cosmology,\nsince any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation.

On definition\n | (a), the peak spectral density occurs at a frequency of 160.2 GHz,\n | corresponding to a 1.873 mm wavelength. Using definition (b), the peak\n | is at a wavelength of 1.06 mm, corresponding to a frequency of\n | 283 GHz.\n\nThe glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny residual\nvariations show a very specific pattern, the same as that expected of a fairly\nuniformly distributed hot gas that has expanded to the current size of the\nuniverse. In particular, the spatial variation in spectral density (the\nderivative of the spectral density function with respect to the angle of\nobservation in the sky) contains small anisotropies, or irregularities, which\nvary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail,\nand match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by\nquantum fluctuations of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of\nthe observable universe we see today. This is a very active field of study, with\nscientists seeking both better data (for example, the Planck spacecraft) and\nbetter interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion.\n\nAlthough many different processes might produce the general form of a black body\nspectrum, no model other than the Big Bang has yet explained the fluctuations.\nAs a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang model of the universe to be\nthe best explanation for the CMBR.\n\nOn December 20, 2012, the Nine-year WMAP data and related images
