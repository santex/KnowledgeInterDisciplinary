{"cursor":"49497","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn the computer science field of artificial intelligence, a 'genetic algorithm\n(GA)' is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. This\nheuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and\nsearch problems. Genetic algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary\nalgorithms (EA), which generate solutions to optimization problems using\ntechniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation,\nselection, and crossover.\n\nGenetic algorithms find application in bioinformatics, phylogenetics,\ncomputational science, engineering, economics, chemistry, manufacturing,\nmathematics, physics, pharmacometrics and other
