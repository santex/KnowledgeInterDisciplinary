Derived from\nthe Latin radix (root), the denotation of radical has changed since its eighteenth-\ncentury coinage to comprehend the entire political spectrumâyet retains the\nâchange at the rootâ connotation fundamental to revolutionary societal change.\nHistorically, radicalism has referred exclusively to the \"radical left\", under\nthe single category of far-left politics, rarely incorporating far-right\npolitics though these may have revolutionary elements; the prominent exception\nis in the United States where some consider radicalism to include both political\nextremes of the radical left and the \"radical right\". In traditional labels of\nthe spectrum of political thought, the opposite of radical on the \"right\" of the\npolitical spectrum is termed reactionary.\n\nThe nineteenth-century [[Cyclopaedia of Political Science]] (1881, 1889) reports\nthat \"radicalism is characterized less by its principles than by the manner of\ntheir application\". [[Cyclopaedia of Political Science]], Political Economy,\nand of the Political History of the United States, 1893, [http://books.google.com/books?id=l-\nJ3vOPWd50C&pg=PA492&dq=%22radicalism+is%22&lr= p. 492, article \"Radicalism\"], by\nMaurice Block Conservatives often used the term radical pejoratively,\nwhereas contemporary left radicals used the term conservative\nderogatorily; Mike Sanders (ed.)

Gilbert\nAbcarian (1971) American Political Radicalism: Contemporary Issues and\nOrientations\n\nThe [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]] records the first political usage of radical as\nascribed to the British Whig Party parliamentarian Charles James Fox, who, in\n1797, proposed a âradical reformâ of the electoral system franchise to provide\nuniversal manhood suffrage, thereby, idiomatically establishing radical to\ndenote supporters of the reformation of the British Parliament. Throughout the\nnineteenth century, the term was combined with political notions and doctrines,\nthus working class radicalism, middle class-, philosophic-, democratic- bourgeois-\n, Tory-, and plebeian radicalism. In the event, politically influential radical\nleaders give rise to their own trend of political radicalism, e.g. Spencean\nradicalism and Carlilean radicalism. Philosophically, the French political\nscientist Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712â78), is the principal theoretician\nproposing political radicalism as feasible in republican political philosophy,\nviz the French Revolution (1789â99), and other modern revolutionsâthe antithesis\nto the liberalism of John Locke.
