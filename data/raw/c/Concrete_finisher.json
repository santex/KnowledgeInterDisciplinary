The job entails placing, finishing, protecting and repairing\nconcrete in engineering and construction projects. Concrete finishers are often responsible for setting\nthe concrete forms, ensuring they have the correct depth and pitch. Concrete\nfinishers place the concrete either directly from the concrete wagon chute,\nconcrete pump, concrete skip or wheelbarrow. They spread the concrete using\nshovels and rakes, sometimes using a straightedge back and forth across the top\nof the forms to âscreed,â or level, the freshly placed concrete. After levelling\nthe concrete, they smooth the surface using either a hand masonry trowel, a long\nhanded âbull floatâ or powered floats. After the concrete has been leveled and\nfloated, concrete finishers press an edger between the forms and the concrete to\ngive a chamfered edges that is less likely to chip.
