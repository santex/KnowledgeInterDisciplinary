Zumdahl, Stephen S., & Zumdahl,\nSusan A. Chemistry. Houghton Mifflin, 2007, ISBN 0618713700 A conjugate\nacid can also be seen as the chemical substance that releases, or donates, a\nproton(hydrogen ion) in the 'forward' chemical reaction, hence, the term acid.\nThe base produced, X â , is called the 'conjugate base', and it\nabsorbs, or gains, a proton in the 'backward' chemical reaction. In aqueous\nsolution, the chemical reaction involved is of the form\n\n:HX + H 2O X â + H 3O +\n\nThis principle is discussed in detail in the article on acid-base reaction\ntheories. The position of the equilibrium is measured as an acid dissociation\nconstant (K a)\n\nStrong acids tend to have a weak conjugate base, and vice versa. The stronger an\nacid, the weaker its conjugate; the same goes for bases. However, a weak acid or\nbase will not necessarily have a strong conjugate base or acid; there are a\nnumber of pairs of weak conjugates. For example, acetic acid\n(CH 3COOH) and the acetate ion (CH 3COO -) are\nboth weak.\n\nTabulated below are several examples of conjugate acid-base pairs; notice how\nthey differ by just one proton (H + ion). Acid strength decreases and\nbase strength increases down the table.\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\"\n|-\n!
