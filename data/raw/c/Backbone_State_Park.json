Carr of Lamont, Iowa. Located in the\nvalley of the Maquoketa River, it is approximately three miles (5 km) south of\nStrawberry Point in Delaware County. Backbone Lake Dam, a relatively low dam\nbuilt by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, creates Backbone Lake.\nThe Civilian Conservation Corps constructed a majority of trails and buildings\nwhich make up the park.\n\nMeasuring , the region is heavily forested, mainly in species of oak and maple.\nThe geology of the area is particularly noteworthy. As part of the Driftless\nArea, it was left unglaciated during the last Ice Age, with very ancient\ndolomite formations dating from the Silurian period. A large ridge of rock\ndivides the park, resembling a spine, and lends its name to the park and\nadjacent forest. The area is characterized by active springs, caves, sinkholes\nand karsts. With cliffs measuring over 80 feet in places, climbing and\nrappelling are popular, but both require a permit.\n\nTwenty-one miles of multi-use trails support year-round recreational activities,\nincluding hiking as well as cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in winter. The\nlake is noted for its swimming, boating, and fishing. Backbone Creek is known to\nsupport both Rainbow and Brown trout, and is stocked by the Iowa Department of\nNatural Resources from local brood ponds. Campsites (49 electrical and 49 non-\nelectrical) and cabins are available for rental (reservations recommended). Two\nshower buildings and a playground are also available.\n\nLocal wildlife abound in the park and surrounding area, including fox,\nturkey, and deer.\n\n'Backbone State Forest' is immediately adjacent to the park. It consists of of\npine forest. Horsebackriding and hunting are permitted in this reserve, but not\nin the park proper.\n\nThe park's administrative headquarters are in Dundee.\n","linknr":329,"url":"Backbone_State_Park","recorded":1362538750,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Civilian Conservation Corps in Iowa","Civilian Conservation Corps museums","Driftless Area","History museums in Iowa","State parks of Iowa","Museums in Delaware County, Iowa","Protected areas established in 1919","Protected areas of Delaware County, Iowa"],"headings":["Iowa Civilian Conservation Corps Museum","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Flag_of_Iowa.svg/22px-Flag_of_Iowa.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Iowa_Locator_Map.PNG/256px-Iowa_Locator_Map.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/Red_pog.svg/9px-Red_pog.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["List_of_Iowa_state_parks","Delaware_County,_Iowa","Strawberry_Point,_Iowa","Geographic_Names_Information_System","United_States_Geological_Survey","Iowa","Maquoketa_River","Strawberry_Point,_Iowa","Delaware_County,_Iowa","Backbone_Lake_Dam","Backbone_Lake","Driftless_Area","Wisconsinian_glaciation","Dolomite","Silurian","Sinkhole","Karst","Dundee,_Iowa","Civilian_Conservation_Corps"]}
