The movement of a body, or link, is studied using geometry so the link\nis considered to be rigid. The connections between links are modeled as\nproviding ideal movement, pure rotation or sliding for example, and are called\njoints. A linkage modeled as a network of rigid links and ideal joints is called\na kinematic chain.\n\nLinkages may be constructed from open chains, closed chains, or a combination of\nopen and closed chains. Each link in a chain is connected by a joint to one or\nmore other links. Thus, a kinematic chain can be modeled as a graph in which the\nlinks are paths and the joints are vertices, which is called a linkage graph.\n\n]] The movement of an ideal joint is generally associated with a subgroup of the\ngroup of Euclidean displacements. The number of parameters in the subgroup is\ncalled the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the joint.\n\nMechanical linkages are usually designed to transform a given input force and\nmovement into a desired output force and movement. The ratio of the output force\nto the input force is known as the mechanical advantage of the linkage, while\nthe ratio of the input speed to the output speed is known as the speed ratio.\nThe speed ratio and mechanical advantage are defined so they yield the same\nnumber in an ideal linkage.\n\nA kinematic chain, in which one link is fixed or stationary, is called a\nmechanism, OED and a linkage designed to be stationary is called a\n'structure'.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Linkage_(mechanical)","recorded":1362478810,"links":0,"instances":["mechanism","mechanism","physics","mechanics","mechanics","mechanical","vehicle"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Machines","Mechanisms","Linkages"],"headings":["Uses","History","Mobility","Joints","Analysis and synthesis of linkages","Planar one degree-of-freedom linkages","Other interesting linkages","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["degree_of_freedom","mechanics"],["power","physics"],["crank","mechanism"],["machine","mechanical"],["suspension","vehicle"],["degree_of_freedom","mechanics"],["degrees_of_freedom","mechanics"],["machine","mechanical"],["whippletree","mechanism"]],"members":["whippletree","crank","power","degree_of_freedom","degrees_of_freedom","machine","suspension"],"related":["Kinematic_chain","Degree_of_freedom_(mechanics)","Mechanical_advantage","Lever","Fulcrum","Power_(physics)","Mechanical_advantage","Four-bar_linkage","Crank_(mechanism)","Machine_(mechanical)","Tool","Bolt_cutter","Suspension_(vehicle)","Robot","Internal_combustion_engine","Piston","Connecting_rod","Crankshaft","Windshield_wiper","Bicycle_suspension","Hydraulic_cylinder","Heavy_equipment","Computer_aided_design","4-bar_linkage","Archimedes","Hero_of_Alexandria","Leonardo_da_Vinci","Watt_steam_engine","James_Watt","Watt's_linkage","J._J._Sylvester","Peaucellier_linkage","Alfred_Kempe","Jacob_E._Goodman","Franz_Reuleaux","Ludwig_Burmester","Descriptive_geometry","Pafnuty_Chebyshev","Burmester's_theory","Degree_of_freedom_(mechanics)","Chebychev–Grübler–Kutzbach_criterion","Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)","Revolute_joint","Prismatic_joint","Spherical_joint","Ludwig_Burmester","Burmester_theory","Four-bar_linkage","Six-bar_linkage","Six-bar_linkage","Four-bar_linkage","Pantograph","Klann_linkage","Parallel_motion","Watt's_linkage","Peaucellier–Lipkin_linkage","Scott_Russell_linkage","Chebyshev_linkage","Hoekens_linkage","Sarrus_linkage","Cruciate_ligament","Compliant_mechanism","Four-bar_linkage","Cruciate_ligament","Tetrapod","Sheep","Bird","Reptile","Bony_fishes","Wrasses","Evolution","Aquatic_predation","Premaxilla","Outline_of_machines","Engineering_mechanics","Cam","Kinematic_pair","Kinematic_coupling","Kinematics","Overconstrained_mechanism","Machine_(mechanical)","Three-point_hitch","Lever","Parallel_motion","Whippletree_(mechanism)","Burmester_theory","Cornell_University","Cornell_University"]}
