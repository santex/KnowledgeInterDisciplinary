{"cursor":"16212","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a stable fluoroalkane liquid]]'Fluorocarbons', sometimes referred to as\n'perfluorocarbons' or PFCs, are organofluorine compounds that contain only\ncarbon and fluorine bonded together in strong carbonâfluorine bonds.\nFluoroalkanes that contain only single bonds are more chemically and thermally\nstable than alkanes. However, fluorocarbons with double bonds (fluoroalkenes)\nand especially triple bonds (fluoroalkynes) are more reactive than their\ncorresponding hydrocarbons. Fluoroalkanes can serve as oil-repellent/water-\nrepellent fluoropolymers, solvents, liquid breathing research agents, and\npowerful greenhouse gases. Unsaturated fluorocarbons tend to be used as\nreactants.\n\n, a reactive and toxic fluoroalkene gas]]Many chemical compounds are labeled as\nfluorocarbons, 'perfluorinated', or with the prefix 'perfluoro-' despite\ncontaining atoms other than carbon or fluorine, such as chlorofluorocarbons and\nperfluorinated compounds; however, these molecules are fluorocarbon derivatives,\nand not true fluorocarbons. Fluorocarbon derivatives share many of the\nproperties of fluorocarbons, while also possessing new properties due to the\ninclusion of new atoms. For example, fluorocarbon derivatives can function as\nfluoropolymers, refrigerants, solvents, anesthetics, fluorosurfactants, and\nozone depletors.\n","linknr":336,"url":"Fluorocarbon","recorded":1362511990,"links":29,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cpr/v823/rpt/108771.pdf","http://fluoroconsultants.com/db4/00322/fluoroconsultants.com/_download/INTRODUCTIONTOFLUOROPOLYMERS.pdf","http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/9jcptv5dak4nafm2/fulltext.pdf"],"categories":["Organofluorides"],"headings":["Usage of term","Properties","Manufacture","Derivatives","Environmental and health concerns","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Perfluorohexane.png/233px-Perfluorohexane.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Perfluoroisobutene.svg/166px-Perfluoroisobutene.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Perfluorodecaline.svg/220px-Perfluorodecaline.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Carbon-tetrafluoride-2D-dimensions.png/220px-Carbon-tetrafluoride-2D-dimensions.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Carbon-fluorine-bond-polarity-2D-black.png/220px-Carbon-fluorine-bond-polarity-2D-black.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Tetrafluoroethylene.svg/120px-Tetrafluoroethylene.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volatility","chemistry"],["sublimation","chemistry"],["saturation","chemistry"],["radical","chemistry"]],"members":["saturation","volatility","sublimation","radical"],"related":["Organofluorine","Carbon","Fluorine","Carbon–fluorine_bond","Alkanes","Alkenes","Alkynes","Lipophobicity","Hydrophobe","Fluoropolymers","Solvent","Liquid_breathing","Greenhouse_gases","Unsaturated_compound","Reactants","Chemical_compounds","Atom","Chlorofluorocarbons","Perfluorinated_compounds","Fluoropolymer","Refrigerants","Solvent","Anesthetics","Fluorosurfactant","Ozone_depletion","Intermolecular_force","Refractive_index","Electronegativity","Polarizability","London_dispersion_force","Lipophobic","Hydrophobic","Non-polar","Gore-Tex","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Coefficient_of_friction","Volatility_(chemistry)","Alkane","Tetrafluoromethane","Hexafluoroethane","Octafluoropropane","Perfluorobutane","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Surface_energy","Dielectric","Partial_charge","Coulombic","Geminal","Inductive_effect","Saturation_(chemistry)","Inert","Birch_reduction","Unsaturated_compound","Acetylene","Fullerene","Nucleophile","Hydrolysis","Tetrafluoroethylene","PTFE","Ethylene","Fluorobenzene","Aromaticity","World_War_II","Exothermic","Manhattan_project","Fowler_process","Fowler_process","Cobalt_fluoride","Cobalt","Perfluorohexane","Electrochemical_fluorination","Electrolysis","Hydrogen_fluoride","3M","Fluorinert","Fluorosurfactant","Surface_tension","Chemical_polarity","Functional_group","Oxygen","Ether","Chlorine","Chlorofluorocarbons","Radical_(chemistry)","Ozone_depletion","Perfluorooctanesulfonic_acid","Perfluorooctanoic_acid","Perfluorononanoic_acid","Methoxyflurane","Enflurane","Isoflurane","Sevoflurane","Desflurane","Polychlorotrifluoroethylene","Perfluorooctyl_bromide","Dichlorodifluoromethane","Chlorodifluoromethane","Polyvinylidene_fluoride","Tetrafluoroethane","Greenhouse_gases","Bioaccumulative","PFOA","PFOS","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Trifluoromethyl","Fluorographene","Liquid_breathing"]}
