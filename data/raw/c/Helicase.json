They are\nmotor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester\nbackbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., DNA, RNA, or RNA-\nDNA hybrid) using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. There are many helicases\nresulting from the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be\ncatalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic genes code for helicases. In humans, 95 non-redundant helicases are coded for in the\ngenome, 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases. Many\ncellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation,\nrecombination, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis involve the separation of\nnucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of helicases.\n","linknr":1414,"url":"Helicase","recorded":1362374300,"links":45,"instances":["gene","biochemistry","gene","molecular_biology","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 3.6.4","DNA replication","Enzymes"],"headings":["Function","History of DNA helicase discovery","Structural features","Superfamilies","Helicase disorders and diseases","RNA helicases","Diagnostic tools for helicase measurement","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Helicase.png/220px-Helicase.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/DNA_replication_en.svg/200px-DNA_replication_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/RecQ_helicase.png/220px-RecQ_helicase.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Human_DEAD-box_RNA_helicase.jpg/220px-Human_DEAD-box_RNA_helicase.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["directionality","molecular_biology"],["substrate","biochemistry"],["blm","gene"],["wrn","gene"]],"members":["blm","substrate","wrn","directionality","translation","transcription"],"related":["Enzyme","Organism","Molecular_motor","Nucleic_acid","Phosphodiester_bond","DNA","RNA","Adenosine_triphosphate","Hydrolysis","DNA_replication","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Genetic_recombination","DNA_repair","Ribosome_biogenesis","DNA","Double_helix","RNA","Adenosine_triphosphate","Hydrogen_bond","Base_pair","DNA_recombination","Ribosome_biogenesis","RNA_splicing","RNA_editing","Nucleic_acid","Directionality_(molecular_biology)","Processivity","Oligomerization","DnaB","DNA","Hexamer","Monomer","Protein_dimer","Boltzmann's_constant","Guanine","Cytosine","Amino_acid","Sequence_homology","Sequence_motif","Primary_structure","Adenosine_triphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Hydrolysis","Nucleic_acid","Substrate_(biochemistry)","Amino_acid","Conserved_sequence","Organism","DNA","DNA","DNA","UvrD","Gram-negative","Gram-positive","Rho","MCM","Heterochromatin_protein_1","ATR-X_syndrome","ERCC2","Cockayne_syndrome","Trichothiodystrophy","Xeroderma_pigmentosa","TFIIH","Nucleotide_excision_repair","RecQ_helicase","RECQL4","Bloom_syndrome","Rothmund-Thomson_syndrome","Werner_syndrome","Poikiloderma_congenitale","Poikiloderma","Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis","Spinal_muscular_atrophy","Spinocerebellar_ataxia","Alzheimer_disease","Lethal_congenital_contracture_syndrome","Radiolabeling","PAGE","Scintillation_proximity_assay","Fluorescence_resonance_energy_transfer","PerkinElmer","Chromodomain","CHD1","CHD1L","CHD2","CHD3","CHD4","CHD5","CHD6","CHD7","CHD8","CHD9","DEAD_box","DEAD/DEAH_box_helicase","DDX3X","DDX5","DDX6","DDX10","DDX11","DDX12","DDX58","DHX8","DHX9","DHX37","DHX40","DHX58","ASCC3","BLM_(gene)","BRIP1","DNA2","FBXO18","FBXO30","HELB","HELLS","HELQ","HELZ","HFM1","HLTF","IFIH1","NAV2","PIF1","RECQL","RTEL1","SHPRH","SMARCA4","SMARCAL1","WRN_(gene)","WRNIP1"]}
