Mastectomy is usually\ndone to treat breast cancer; in some cases, women and some men believed to be at\nhigh risk of breast cancer have the operation prophylactically, that is, to\nprevent cancer rather than treat it. It is also the medical procedure carried\nout to remove breast cancer tissue in males. Alternatively, certain patients can\nchoose to have a wide local excision, also known as a lumpectomy, an operation\nin which a small volume of breast tissue containing the tumor and some\nsurrounding healthy tissue is removed to conserve the breast. Both mastectomy\nand lumpectomy are what are referred to as \"local therapies\" for breast cancer,\ntargeting the area of the tumor, as opposed to systemic therapies such as\nchemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy.\n\nTraditionally, in the case of breast cancer, the whole breast was removed.\nCurrently the decision to do the mastectomy is based on various factors\nincluding breast size, number of lesions, biologic aggressiveness of a breast\ncancer, the availability of adjuvant radiation, and the willingness of the\npatient to accept higher rates of tumor recurrences after lumpectomy and\nradiation. Outcome studies comparing mastectomy to lumpectomy with radiation\nhave suggested that routine radical mastectomy surgeries will not always prevent\nlater distant secondary tumors arising from micro-metastases prior to discovery,\ndiagnosis, and operation.\n","linknr":385,"url":"Mastectomy","recorded":1362510677,"links":40,"instances":["wife_of_justinian_i","biology"],"pdf":["http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/94summer/chapter1.pdf","http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/94summer/chapter1.pdf"],"categories":["Breast surgery","Surgical oncology","Surgical removal procedures"],"headings":["Rates","Indications","Types","History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Mastectomie_02.jpg/230px-Mastectomie_02.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Examples_of_Custom_Nipple_Prostheses.jpg/120px-Examples_of_Custom_Nipple_Prostheses.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Discrene_Breast_forms.JPG/120px-Discrene_Breast_forms.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/BreastCancer.jpg/120px-BreastCancer.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/Breast_cancer_gross_appearance.jpg/120px-Breast_cancer_gross_appearance.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["theodora","wife_of_justinian_i"],["sex_reassignment_surgery","female-to-male"]],"members":["sex_reassignment_surgery","theodora","cell"],"related":["Breast","Breast_cancer","Prophylaxis","Wide_local_excision","Lumpectomy","Tumor","Chemotherapy","Exemestane","Chemotherapy","Sentinel_lymph_node","Metastasis","Cancer","Cell_(biology)","Radical_mastectomy","Areola","Skin","Subcutis","Nipple_prosthesis","Breast_prostheses","Gross_examination","AÃ«tius_of_Amida","Theodora_(wife_of_Justinian_I)","Skoptsy","Breast_prostheses","Breast_reconstruction","Fat_transfer","Nipple_prosthesis","Sex_reassignment_surgery_(female-to-male)","National_Cancer_Institute","BBC","EMedicine"]}
