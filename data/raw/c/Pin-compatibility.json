{"cursor":"4400","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In electronics, a 'pin-compatible' device, such as a logic integrated circuit\n(IC), memory module or microprocessor, is one that has the same functions\nassigned to the same particular pins. [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pin-\ncompatible.html business dictionary - pin-compatible]\n\nThere are several levels of compatibility in integrated circuits (ICs). Strictly\nspeaking, \"pin-compatible\" refers only to two chips that have the same functions\nassigned to the same pins. For instance, two logic chips would have their\ninputs, outputs, power supply, and ground connections on the same pins.\n\nGenerally the term \"pin compatibility\" (or \"pin-for-pin replacement\") also\npresumes mechanical and a significant degree of electrical compatibility, and\nthe expression \"pin-compatible\" is often used as shorthand to refer to\ncompatibility in all three of these senses, although terms such as \"drop-in\nreplacement\" or \"equivalent device\" or \"exact replacement\" imply more certain\ncompatibility.\n\nICs are mechanically compatible if they can be inserted into the same socket or\nsoldered to the same footprint. This is generally true only if they use the same\npackaging standard (e.g. DIP, TO-220, TSOP, etc.). Small details can be\nimportant, such as a ceramic dual-in-line package being slightly higher than the\nplastic counterpart may mean devices that are pin-compatible and electrically\ncompatible still not being able to be always be used interchangeably in some high-\ndensity equipment.\n\nElectrical compatibility implies that the ICs work with the same supply and\nsignaling voltage levels; that one is a suitable replacement for another\n(perhaps in a particular circuit, or in general). What constitutes electrical\ncompatibility (and indeed pin compatibility) varies considerably in popular\nusage; be aware there may still be differences in:\n* operating temperature range and the guarantee of various characteristics over\n  a wide temperature range\n* speed (for logic circuits; bandwidth for analog circuits)\n* power supply current demand or working voltage range; the 74HC family of chips\n  can run on 2V to 6V supplies, while the 74HCT family only tolerates 4.5V to\n  5.5V and so on. One Integrated Circuit may be able to replace another in a\n  particular circuit, with a particular supply voltage for instance, yet the two\n  are not perfectly interchangeable (e.g. a 74HCT00 could not safely be used in\n  a 6V circuit designed for a 74HC00 or 74C00). Careful checking of\n  manufacturer's datasheets remains important even when one device is said to be\n  a pin-for-pin replacement for another.\n\nThe most widely used and recognized family of pin-compatible chips is the 74'xx\nseries of logic ICs (although there are a small number of pin-out\nincompatibilities). The tick-mark here represents the omitted subfamily\ndesignator -- most commonly HC (high-speed CMOS), but can also be blank\n(original TTL), C (CMOS), LS (low-power Schottky), and many others. The \"xx\"\nrepresents the actual part, and ranges from 00 (quad 2-input NAND) to 40103 (8-\nbit synchronous binary down counter). All of the various families have remained\npin-compatible over several decades of production by numerous different\ncompanies, including some versions that were not electrically compatible.\nExceptions are few, but include the 7400N (or 74LS00J/N/W) vs the 7400W; the\n7454(J or N) compared with 7454W, 74H54, 74LS54 and 74L54W (five different 4-\nwide AND-OR-INVERT gate combinations of pin-out and logic function for the same\ndevice number). Ironically (given the history of competition between the two\nlogic series), the 74HC series has grown to include pin-compatible versions of\nseveral members of the 4000 series chips, such as the 74HC4051.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Pin-compatibility","recorded":1363439966,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Electronics","/wiki/Logic_gate","/wiki/Computer_data_storage","/wiki/Microprocessor","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Integrated_circuit","/wiki/Dual_in-line_package","/wiki/TO-220","/wiki/Thin_small-outline_package","/wiki/Integrated_circuit","/wiki/Operating_temperature","/wiki/Integrated_Circuit","/wiki/Datasheets","/wiki/7400_series","/wiki/Pin-out","/wiki/CMOS","/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic","/wiki/Schottky","/wiki/Negated_AND_gate","/wiki/Counter","/wiki/4000_series","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/7400_series","/wiki/List_of_7400_series_integrated_circuits","/wiki/4000_series","/wiki/List_of_4000_series_integrated_circuits","/wiki/Logic_gate","/wiki/Open_collector","/wiki/Logic_family","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=edit&section=2","http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/giicm/","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pin-compatible.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&oldid=470904057","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Integrated_circuits","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pin-compatibility&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Pin-compatibility","/wiki/Pin-compatibility","/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pin-compatibility&action=edit&redlink=1","#","/wiki/Pin-compatibility","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Pin-compatibility","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Pin-compatibility","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&oldid=470904057","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Pin-compatibility&id=470904057","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Pin-compatibility","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Pin-compatibility&oldid=470904057&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Pin-compatibility&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin-compatibility","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Integrated
