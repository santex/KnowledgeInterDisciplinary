Other characteristics are a call and response between the soloist\nand the chorus, and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally\nuses improvisational additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds.\n","linknr":681,"url":"Soul_Music","recorded":1362560467,"links":77,"instances":["singer","musician","producer","band","people","african_american_news_website","band","musician","musician","singer","music","music","singer","music","instrument","singer","musician","musician","song","singer","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soul
