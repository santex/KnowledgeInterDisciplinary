{"cursor":"10785","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'ion-selective electrode' ('ISE'), also known as a 'specific ion electrode'\n('SIE'), is a transducer (or sensor) that converts the activity of a specific\nion dissolved in a solution into an electrical potential, which can be measured\nby a voltmeter or pH meter. The voltage is theoretically dependent on the\nlogarithm of the ionic activity, according to the Nernst equation. The sensing\npart of the electrode is usually made as an ion-specific membrane, along with a\nreference electrode. Ion-selective electrodes are used in biochemical and\nbiophysical research, where measurements of ionic concentration in an aqueous\nsolution are required, usually on a real time basis.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Ion_Selective_electrode","recorded":1362481304,"links":21,"instances":["tests","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1994/pdf/6612x2527.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1994/pdf/6612x2527.pdf"],"categories":["Electrodes"],"headings":["Types of ion-selective membrane","Interferences","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["activity","chemistry"],["specificity","tests"]],"members":["specificity","activity"],"related":["Transducer","Sensor","Activity_(chemistry)","Ion","Solution","Potential","Voltmeter","PH_meter","Logarithm","Nernst_equation","Electrode","Artificial_membrane","Reference_electrode","Biochemistry","Biophysics","Ion","Concentration","Aqueous_solution","Glass","Silicate","Chalcogenide","Binding_selectivity","Cation","Chalcogenide_glass","PH_glass_electrode","Crystal_structure","Electrode","Cation","Anion","Fluoride_selective_electrode","Lanthanum_fluoride","Resin","Polymer","Potassium_selective_electrode","Valinomycin","Capillary_tubing","Polyvinyl_chloride","Solvent","Plasticizer","Phthalate","Specificity_(tests)","Ion_channel","Ion","Syringe","Hypodermic_needle","O-ring","Platinum_electrode","Galvanometer","PH_meter","Reference_electrode","Enzyme","PH","Glucose","Nitrate","Perchlorate","Iodide","Chloride","Sulfate","Ammonia","Titanium_chloride","Trivalent_titanium","Nitrate","Ammonium","Nitrification","Total_Ionic_Strength_Adjustment_Buffer","Electrolytes","PEDOT-TMA"]}
