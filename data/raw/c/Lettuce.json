It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but sometimes for its\nstem and seeds. Lettuce was first cultivated by the ancient Egyptians who turned\nit from a weed, whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a plant grown for its\nleaves. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the\nname \"[[lactuca]]\", from which the English \"lettuce\" is ultimately derived. By\n50 AD, multiple types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval\nwritings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the\ndevelopment of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars\nwere described that can still be found in gardens. Europe and North America\noriginally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 1900s the\nconsumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world.\n\nGenerally grown as a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, although it\nrequires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly. It\ncan be plagued with numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal\npests and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the\nspecies and with some other species within the Lactuca genus; although this\ntrait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists\nhave used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties. World\nproduction of lettuce and chicory for calendar year 2010 stood at , over half of\nwhich came from China.\n\nLettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds\nof food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps. One type is grown for its stems,\nwhich are eaten either raw or cooked. Lettuce is a good source of vitamin A and\npotassium, as well as a minor source for several other vitamins and nutrients.\nDespite its beneficial properties, lettuce when contaminated is often a source\nof bacterial, viral and parasitic outbreaks in humans, including [[Escherichia\ncoli|E. coli]] and [[Salmonella]]. In addition to its main use as a leafy green,\nit has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of\nhuman consumption.\n","linknr":706,"url":"Lettuce","recorded":1362503898,"links":104,"instances":["botany","botany","flower_structure","god","botany","biology","cooking","botany","plants","horticulture"],"pdf":["http://ucanr.org/freepubs/docs/7216.pdf","http://ucanr.org/freepubs/docs/7216.pdf","http://aic.ucdavis.edu/profiles/lettuce-2005.pdf","http://aic.ucdavis.edu/profiles/lettuce-2005.pdf","http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca1011p3-64576.pdf","http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/repositoryfiles/ca1011p3-64576.pdf"],"categories":["Cichorieae","Leaf
