{"cursor":"4667","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", the proton binds to oxygens and functions as a Lewis acid to activate the\nester carbonyl (top row) as an electrophile, and converts the hydroxyl into the\ngood leaving group water (bottom left). Both lower the kinetic barrier and speed\nup the attainment of chemical equilibrium.]] In 'acid catalysis' and 'base\ncatalysis' a chemical reaction is catalyzed by an acid or a base. The acid is\noften the proton and the base is often a hydroxyl ion. Typical reactions\ncatalyzed by proton transfer are esterfications and aldol reactions. In these\nreactions the conjugate acid of the carbonyl group is a better electrophile than\nthe neutral carbonyl group itself. Catalysis by either acid or base can occur in\ntwo different ways: 'specific catalysis' and 'general catalysis'.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Specific_acid_catalysis","recorded":1362375132,"links":17,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05796.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/S05796.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/G02609.pdf","http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/G02609.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical kinetics","Catalysis"],"headings":["Use in synthesis","Kinetics","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Fischer_esterification_mechanism.svg/400px-Fischer_esterification_mechanism.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/4/ff4b8089345cd91222b10a0e9a34d625.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/e/9/4e9bfcedda3b5de614ad41a63cbd2a7c.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base"],"related":["Proton","Lewis_acid","Carbonyl","Electrophile","Hydroxyl","Leaving_group","Chemical_equilibrium","Chemical_reaction","Catalysis","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Hydrogen_ion","Hydroxyl","Esterfication","Aldol_reaction","Conjugate_acid","Carbonyl","Electrophile","Organic_chemistry","Sulfuric_acid","Leaving_group","Hydrofluoric_acid","Phosphoric_acid","Toluenesulfonic_acid","Polystyrene_sulfonate","Heteropoly_acid","Zeolite","Graphene_oxide","Ester","Reaction_rate","Concentration","Chemical_equilibrium","Buffer_solution","PH","Concentration","Chemical_kinetics","Aldol_reaction","Reaction_rate","Diazonium_coupling"]}
