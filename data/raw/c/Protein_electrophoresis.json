{"cursor":"10945","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Protein electrophoresis' is a method for analysing the proteins in a fluid or\nan extract. The electrophoresis may be performed with a small volume of sample\nin a number of alternative ways with or without a supporting medium: SDS\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (in short gel electrophoresis, PAGE, or SDS-\nelectrophoresis, free flow electrophoresis, electrofocusing, isotachophoresis,\naffinity electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, counterelectrophoresis, and\ncapillary electrophoresis). Each method has many variations with individual\nadvantages and limitations. Gel electrophoresis is often performed in\ncombination with electroblotting immunoblotting to give additional information\nabout a specific protein. Because of practical limitations, protein\nelectrophoresis is generally not suited as a preparative method.\n\n\n.]]\n","linknr":264,"url":"Protein_electrophoresis","recorded":1362509953,"links":19,"instances":["physics","fastpp","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrophoresis","Molecular biology","Protein methods","Laboratory techniques","Blood tests"],"headings":["Denaturing gel methods","Native gel methods","Protein electrophoresis in medicine","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Electrophoresis.png/220px-Electrophoresis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Monoclonal_gammopathy_Multiple_Myeloma.png/220px-Monoclonal_gammopathy_Multiple_Myeloma.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["denaturation","biochemistry"],["charge","physics"],["fast_parallel_proteolysis","fastpp"]],"members":["charge","fast_parallel_proteolysis","denaturation"],"related":["Gel_electrophoresis","Free_flow_electrophoresis","Electrofocusing","Isotachophoresis","Affinity_electrophoresis","Immunoelectrophoresis","Counterelectrophoresis","Capillary_electrophoresis","Gel_electrophoresis","Electroblotting","Immunoblotting","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Protein","Electrophoresis","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Polypeptide","Detergent","Logarithm","PAGE","Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue","Charge_(physics)","Detergent","Dissociate","Quenching","Chemoluminescence","Western_blot","Fluorescence","Prosthetic_group","Heme","Chlorophyll","Proteins","Polyacrylamide","Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue","FÃ¶rster_resonance_energy_transfer","Membrane_protein","Dissociate","Protein_folding","Protein_complex","PH","Metalloproteins","Medicine","Protein","Blood_serum","Blood_plasma","Gel_electrophoresis","Blood_proteins","Serum_albumin","Globulin","Albumin","Transthyretin","Monoclonal_gammopathy_of_undetermined_significance","Multiple_myeloma","Alpha_1-antitrypsin","Haptoglobin","Alpha_2-macroglobulin","Alpha_2-antiplasmin","Ceruloplasmin","Transferrin","LDL","Complement_system","Immunoglobulin","Paraprotein","Affinity_electrophoresis","Electroblotting","Electrofocusing","Gel_electrophoresis","Immunoelectrophoresis","Immunofixation","Native_gel_electrophoresis","QPNC-PAGE","Paraprotein","Fast_parallel_proteolysis_(FASTpp)"]}
