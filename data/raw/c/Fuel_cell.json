{"cursor":"92517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'fuel cell' is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into\nelectricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen or another oxidizing\nagent. Hydrogen is the most common fuel, but hydrocarbons such as\nnatural gas and alcohols like methanol are sometimes used. Fuel cells are\ndifferent from batteries in that they require a constant source of fuel and\noxygen to run, but they can produce electricity continually for as long as these\ninputs are supplied.\n\nWelsh Physicist William Grove developed the first crude fuel cells in 1839. The\nfirst commercial use of fuel cells was in NASA space programs to generate power\nfor probes, satellites and space capsules. Since then, fuel cells have been used\nin many other applications. Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for\ncommercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible\nareas. They are used to power fuel cell vehicles, including automobiles, buses,\nforklifts, airplanes, boats, motorcycles and submarines.\n\nThere are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an anode (negative\nside), a cathode (positive side) and an electrolyte that allows charges to\nmove between the two sides of the fuel cell. Electrons are drawn from the\nanode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current\nelectricity. As the main difference among fuel cell types is the electrolyte,\nfuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use. Fuel cells come\nin a variety of sizes. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small\nelectrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are \"stacked\", or placed in\nseries, to increase the voltage and meet an application's\nrequirements. Nice, Karim and Strickland, Jonathan. [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/alternative-fuels/fuel-\ncell2.htm \"How Fuel Cells Work: Polymer Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells\"]. How\nStuff Works, accessed August 4, 2011 In addition to electricity, fuel\ncells produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small\namounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions. The energy efficiency of a\nfuel cell is generally between 40â60%, or up to 85% efficient if waste heat is\ncaptured for use.\n\nThe fuel cell market is also growing at a healthy pace and according to Pike\nResearch, the stationary fuel cell market is predicted to reach 50 GW by\n2020.\n","linknr":1199,"url":"Fuel_cell","recorded":1362508741,"links":104,"instances":["electricity","japan","washington","ship"],"pdf":["http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/~kwanshui/Paper/IJHE2.pdf","http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/wtr/wtr08/wtr08_p36-39.pdf","http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/epact_743_fuel_cell_school_bus.pdf","http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/epact_743_fuel_cell_school_bus.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/pdfs/fc_comparison_chart.pdf","http://www.infomesr.org/attachments/13-034.pdf","http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf","http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/48219.pdf","http://www.fuelcells.org/BusinessCaseforFuelCells.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/pdfs/fc_comparison_chart.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/46679.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/51564.pdf","http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress10/viii_0_technology_validation_overview.pdf","http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/339.pdf","http://www.efcf.com/reports/E21.pdf","http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress10/viii_0_technology_validation_overview.pdf","http://fchea.org/core/import/PDFs/Materials%20Handling%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf","http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/education/pdfs/early_markets_forklifts.pdf","http://www.horizonfuelcell.com/file/Pterosoardistancerecord.pdf","http://www.schydrogen.org/documents/Reports/Cluster_Successes.pdf","http://unit.aist.go.jp/hydrogenius/ci/event/ihdf2012/pdf/1-1higashi.pdf","http://www.pikeresearch.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/FCAR-11-Executive-Summary.pdf","http://www.fuelcell-magazine.com/eprints/free/johnsonmattheyapril03.pdf","http://www.fuelcell-magazine.com/eprints/free/johnsonmattheyapril03.pdf","http://www.y-carbon.us/Portals/0/docs/Media/Newsletter_september_2009.pdf","http://www.y-carbon.us/Portals/0/docs/Media/TR35.pdf","http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file15304.pdf"],"categories":["Fuel
