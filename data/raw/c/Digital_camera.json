{"cursor":"45507","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]] A 'digital camera' (or 'digicam') is a camera that takes video or still\nphotographs by recording images on an electronic image sensor. Most cameras sold\ntoday are digital, and digital cameras are incorporated into many\ndevices ranging from PDAs and mobile phones (called camera phones) to vehicles.\n\nDigital and film cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a\nvariable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device. The diaphragm and\nshutter admit the correct amount of light to the imager, just as with film but\nthe image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film\ncameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being\nrecorded, and store and delete images from memory. Many digital cameras can also\nrecord moving video with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch\npictures and perform other elementary image editing.\n","linknr":773,"url":"Digital_camera","recorded":1362675520,"links":83,"instances":["image","film","company","optics","image","optics","electricity","merchandise","photography","company","photography","photography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American
