National\nNon-Food Crops Centre.

Much of the\nfermentation used industrially to produce food and drink products, as well as\nhome fermentation, uses anaerobic digestion. Silage is produced by anaerobic\ndigestion.\n\nThe digestion process begins with bacterial hydrolysis of the input materials to\nbreak down insoluble organic polymers, such as carbohydrates, and make them\navailable for other bacteria. Acidogenic bacteria then convert the sugars and\namino acids into carbon dioxide, hydrogen, ammonia, and organic acids.\nAcetogenic bacteria then convert these resulting organic acids into acetic acid,\nalong with additional ammonia, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Finally,\nmethanogens convert these products to methane and carbon dioxide.

As part of an integrated waste management system, anaerobic digestion\nreduces the emission of landfill gas into the atmosphere. Anaerobic digesters\ncan also be fed with purpose-grown energy crops, such as maize.

The process\nproduces a biogas, consisting of methane, carbon dioxide and traces of other\nâcontaminantâ gases. This biogas can be used directly as\ncooking fuel, in combined heat and power gas engines [http://www.clarke-\nenergy.co.uk/gas_engines.html GE Jenbacher Biogas Engines], www.clarke-\nenergy.com, accessed 15.04.11 or upgraded to natural gas-quality\nbiomethane. The use of biogas as a fuel helps to replace fossil fuels. The nutrient-\nrich digestate also produced can be used as fertilizer.\n\nAnaerobic digestion facilities have been recognized by the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme as one of the most useful decentralized sources of energy\nsupply, as they are less capital-intensive than large power plants.
