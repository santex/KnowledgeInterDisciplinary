{"cursor":"4580","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Democratic and Popular Union' (Spanish: Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica y Popular)\n(1977â84) was a Bolivian umbrella political party uniting various smaller left-\nwing parties. It was formed in 1977 by former president HernÃ¡n Siles Zuazo and\nconsisted chiefly of Siles' Movimiento Nationalista Revolutionario de Izquierda\n(Revolutionary Nationalist Movement of the Left), a spin-off of the Moviminento\nNacionalista Revolucionario (Revolutionary Nationalist Movement), and Jaime Paz\nZamora's Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (Revolutionary Left Movement).\nThe coalition became extremely popular with Bolivian voters in the late 1970s,\ndue to fatigue with the military dictatorships that for the most controlled the\ncountry since 1964.\n\nThe UDP presented itself for elections in 1978, with Siles Zuazo at the head of\nthe ticket. By all accounts, it won a plurality. The vote was annulled, however,\ndue to the discovery of massive fraud on behalf of the officialist candidate,\nGeneral Juan Pereda. New elections were conducted in 1979. They, too, proved\ninconclusive, as the UDP's HernÃ¡n Siles Zuazo, with Paz Zamora as his vice-\npresidential running mate, finished first at the ballot box, but without\nattaining the 50% majority necessary for direct election. Thus, it was left to\nCongress to determine the next Chief Executive, as stipulated in the Bolivian\nConstitution. Congress could not agree on any candidate, no matter how many\nvotes were taken. Eventually, Congress proclaimed as temporary President the\nhead of the Senate, Dr. WÃ¡lter Guevara, pending the calling of yet a new round\nof elections in 1980.\n\nDuring the 1980 elections, the ultra-right wing of the Bolivian military began\nto intimate that it would never stand for the installation in the Palacio\nQuemado of the \"extremist\" Siles and Paz Zamora. In April, the small rented\nplane in which Paz Zamora and a delegation of UDP politicians were traveling\ncrashed in the Altiplano near La Paz, with the resulting death of all on board\nexcept the Vice-Presidential candidate. No one doubts that it was an\nassassination attempt. In any case, Paz recovered from his wounds and resumed\ncampaigning, buoyed by the increasing support received by the UDP in the\naftermath of the \"accident.\" The winner of this third vote in three years was,\nyet again, the Siles Zuazo-Paz Zamora formula. The two would have been sworn in,\nweren't for the July 17, 1980, coup of General Luis GarcÃ­a Meza, which brutally\ninterrupted the democratic process.\n\nSiles Zuazo and Paz Zamora fled to exile, but returned in 1982, when the\nmilitary's experiment had run its course and the Bolivian economy was on the\nverge of collapse. In October 1982 the results of the 1980 elections were upheld\nand Siles Zuazo was sworn in, with Paz Zamora as his Vice-President. The\neconomic situation was dire indeed, and soon a galloping hyper-inflationary\nprocess developed. Siles, and the UDP government in general, had great\ndifficulty in controlling the situation. In all fairness, the ruling coalition\nreceived scant support from the other political parties or members of congress,\nmost of whom were eager to flex their newly acquired political muscles after so\nmany years of authoritarianism. The unions, led by the old firebrand Juan LechÃ­n\nparalyzed the government with constant strikes. At this point, the MIR (led by\nPaz Zamora) disassociated itself from the regime (1984), deserting the UDP's\nsinking ship when Siles' popularity sank to an all-time low. For all purposes,\nthe UDP ceased to exist at that point.\n\nBy 1985, the government's impotence prompted Congress to call early elections,\nciting the fact that Siles had been originally elected five long before. With\nthe UDP having splintered completely, Siles retired but his MNR-I party ran in\nthe 1985 elections under the leadership of Roberto JordÃ¡n Pando. It did very\npoorly at the polls. As for the MIR (the UDP's other main component group), it\nran in the 1985 elections under its own name and finished third. Its leader, Paz\nZamora, went on to be elected President in 1989. The UDP was never resuscitated\nagain, but remains a powerful symbol of the early phase of democratic\nconsolidation (1977â84), when it was Bolivia's most popular party.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Democratic_and_Popular_Union","recorded":1362896864,"links":13,"instances":["bolivia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Political parties established in 1977","Political parties in Bolivia"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["revolutionary_left_movement","bolivia"]],"members":["revolutionary_left_movement"],"related":["Spanish_language","Bolivia","Political_party","Left-wing","Hernán_Siles_Zuazo","Revolutionary_Nationalist_Movement","Jaime_Paz_Zamora","Revolutionary_Left_Movement_(Bolivia)","Juan_Pereda_Asbún","Hernán_Siles_Zuazo","Wálter_Guevara_Arze","Palacio_Quemado","La_Paz","Luis_García_Meza","Juan_Lechín"]}
