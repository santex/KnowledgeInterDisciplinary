With UDP,\ncomputer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as\n[[datagram]]s, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network without prior\ncommunications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. The\nprotocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.\n\nUDP uses a simple transmission model with a minimum of protocol\nmechanism. RFC 768 p1 It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus\nexposes any unreliability of the underlying network protocol to the user's\nprogram. As this is normally IP over unreliable media, there is no guarantee of\ndelivery, ordering or duplicate protection. UDP provides checksums for data\nintegrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and\ndestination of the datagram.\n\nUDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction is either not\nnecessary or performed in the application, avoiding the overhead of such\nprocessing at the network interface level. Time-sensitive applications often use\nUDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets, which\nmay not be an option in a real-time system. If\nerror correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an\napplication may use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control\nTransmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\n\nA number of UDP's attributes make it especially suited for certain applications.\n* It is 'transaction-oriented', suitable for simple query-response protocols\n  such as the Domain Name System or the Network Time Protocol.\n* It provides '[[datagrams]]', suitable for modeling other protocols such as in\n  IP tunneling or Remote Procedure Call and the Network File System.\n* It is 'simple', suitable for bootstrapping or other purposes without a full\n  protocol stack, such as the DHCP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol.\n* It is 'stateless', suitable for very large numbers of clients, such as in\n  streaming media applications for example IPTV\n* The 'lack of retransmission delays' makes it suitable for real-time\n  applications such as Voice over IP, online games, and many protocols built on\n  top of the Real Time Streaming Protocol.\n* Works well in 'unidirectional' communication, suitable for broadcast\n  information such as in many kinds of service discovery and shared information\n  such as broadcast time or Routing Information Protocol\n","linknr":361,"url":"User_Datagram_Protocol","recorded":1362896865,"links":64,"instances":["computing","computing","computing"],"pdf":["http://condor.depaul.edu/~jkristof/papers/udpscanning.pdf"],"categories":["Internet protocols","Internet standards","Transport layer protocols"],"headings":["Service ports","Packet structure","Checksum computation","Pseudo-Headers","Reliability and congestion control solutions","Applications","Comparison of UDP and TCP","See also","References","RFC references","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["client","computing"],["server","computing"],["octet","computing"]],"members":["client","octet","server"],"related":["Internet_protocol_suite","Internet","Internet_Protocol","David_P._Reed","Handshaking","IP","Checksums","Port_numbers","Transmission_Control_Protocol","Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol","Domain_Name_System","Network_Time_Protocol","IP_tunneling","Remote_Procedure_Call","Network_File_System","Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol","Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol","Streaming_media","IPTV","Voice_over_IP","Online_games","Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol","Service_discovery","Routing_Information_Protocol","Datagram_socket","IP_address","Port_number","Bit","Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority","Unix","Operating_system","Superuser","Registered_port","Ephemeral_port","Client_(computing)","Server_(computing)","Transport_Layer","IETF","Upper_layer_protocol","Multiplexing","Port_number","Checksum","Octet_(computing)","Bit","IPv4","Checksum","IPv4","IPv6","Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol","Streaming_media","Voice_over_IP","Transmission_Control_Protocol","Network_congestion","Datagram_Congestion_Control_Protocol","Domain_Name_System","Simple_Network_Management_Protocol","Routing_Information_Protocol","Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol","Point_of_sale","Accounting_software","Database_management_system","Quality_of_service","Transmission_Control_Protocol","Congestion_control","Byte","Connectionless_protocol","Congestion_collapse","List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers","Reliable_User_Datagram_Protocol","SCTP","UDP_flood_attack","UDP_Data_Transport","UDP_Lite","UDP_Helper_Address","Micro_Transport_Protocol"]}
