Colors closer to red are hot areas and colors closer to blue are cold areas.\n  A hot, less-dense lower boundary layer sends plumes of hot material upwards,\n  and likewise, cold material from the top moves downwards.]] 'Convection' is\n  the concerted, collective movement of ensembles of molecules within fluids\n  (e.g., liquids, gases) and rheids. Convection of mass cannot take place in\n  solids, since neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion can take\n  place in solids. Diffusion of heat can take place in solids, but is referred\n  to separately in that case as heat conduction. A good model for convection is\n  when you take a heat source (e.g. Bunsen burner) and place it at any side of\n  a glass full of a liquid, you then can feel the different levels of heat in\n  the glass.\n\nConvective heat transfer is one of the major modes of heat transfer and\nconvection is also a major mode of mass transfer in fluids. Convective heat and\nmass transfer take place through both diffusion â the random Brownian motion of\nindividual particles in the fluid â and by advection, in which matter or heat is\ntransported by the larger-scale motion of currents in the fluid. In the context\nof heat and mass transfer, the term \"convection\" is used to refer to the sum of\nadvective and diffusive transfer. {{cite book\n  | author = Frank P. Incropera authorlink = Frank P.

Sometimes\n  | \"convection\" is even used to refer specifically to \"free heat convection\"\n  | (natural heat convection), as opposed to forced heat convection. However, in\n  | mechanics the correct use of the word is the general sense, and different\n  | types of convection should be properly qualified for clarity.\n\nConvection can be qualified in terms of being natural, forced, gravitational,\ngranular, or thermomagnetic. It may also be said to be due to combustion,\ncapillary action, or Marangoni and Weissenberg effects. Due to its role in heat\ntransfer, natural convection plays a role in the structure of Earth's\natmosphere, its oceans, and its mantle. Discrete convective cells in the\natmosphere can be seen as clouds, with stronger convection resulting in\nthunderstorms. Natural convection also plays a role in stellar physics.\n","linknr":550,"url":"Convection","recorded":1362540659,"links":78,"instances":["physics","physics","geology","mathematics","process_engineering","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/regoc/pdffiles/colour/double/04P-Ekman-left.pdf","http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/parkerprogram/berger/pdf/OcnBasLesson06.pdf"],"categories":["Concepts
