It\nconsisted of Adam Drucker (Doseone), Jeffrey Logan (Jel), Dax Pierson, Jordan\nDalrymple, Alexander Kort, and Marty Dowers. The band was formed in 2001. While\nconsidered by the artists to be \"genreless\", Subtle had close ties to the hip\nhop and indie music scene.\n\nAlthough both Doseone and Jel have strong ties to the Anticon collective, Subtle\nwas not on the Anticon label roster. Subtle was signed to Lex Records.\n","linknr":292,"url":"Subtle_(music)","recorded":1362575329,"links":14,"instances":["band","band","musical_instrument","subtle_ep"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic music groups from California","American hip hop groups","Anticon"],"headings":["Personnel","History","Discography","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sampler","musical_instrument"],["sampler","musical_instrument"],["summer","subtle_ep"],["hood","band"],["trans_am","band"]],"members":["trans_am","hood","sampler","summer"],"related":["Oakland,_California","United_States","Electronic_music","Indie_rock","Alternative_hip_hop","Lex_Records","Astralwerks","EMI","Anticon","Themselves","Doseone","Jel","Dax_Pierson","Jordan_Dalrymple","Alternative_hip_hop","Oakland,_California","Doseone","Jel","Dax_Pierson","Jordan_Dalrymple","Anticon","Lex_Records","Doseone","Human_voice","Sampler_(musical_instrument)","Jel","Sampler_(musical_instrument)","Drum_machine","Jordan_Dalrymple","Drum_kit","Guitar","Synthesizer","Dax_Pierson","Electronic_keyboard","Synthesizer","Harmonica","Autoharp","Wind_instrument","Synthesizer","Electric_cello","Amoeba_Music","Summer_(Subtle_EP)","Earthsick","Kelly_Osbourne","13_&_God","Astralwerks","EMI","Lex","Astralwerks","EMI","GIGA_Television","Tunde_Adebimpe","TV_on_the_Radio","Notwist","Hood_(band)","ExitingARM","Thee_More_Shallows","Black_Moth_Super_Rainbow","Genghis_Tron","Trans_Am_(band)"]}
