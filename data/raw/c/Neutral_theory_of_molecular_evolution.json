Kimura, Motoo. 1983.\nThe neutral theory of molecular evolution. Cambridge (page xi) The theory\nwas introduced by Motoo Kimura in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Neutral theory\nis compatible with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection: adaptive\nchanges are acknowledged as present and important, but hypothesized to be a\nsmall minority of all the changes seen fixed in DNA sequences. Kimura\n(1986) Since then, this hypothesis has been tested using the McDonald-\nKreitman test, and has not been supported in all species. Even in\nthose species in which adaptive changes are rare, background selection at linked\nsites may violate neutral theory's assumptions regarding genetic drift.\n","linknr":316,"url":"Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","recorded":1362484017,"links":30,"instances":["biology","biology","population_genetics"],"pdf":["http://bioportal.weizmann.ac.il/course/evogen/Neutral/kimura.pdf","http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/king.pdf"],"categories":["Population genetics","Molecular evolution"],"headings":["Overview","The \"neutralistâ€“selectionist\" debate","See also","References<!-- ZoolRes26:225. -->"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","population_genetics"],["fitness","biology"],["fixation","population_genetics"],["polymorphism","biology"]],"members":["fitness","polymorphism","fixation"],"related":["Evolution","DNA_sequence","Genetic_drift","Selection","Mutation","Motoo_Kimura","Charles_Darwin","Natural_selection","Fixation_(population_genetics)","McDonald-Kreitman_test","Mutation","Jack_L._King","Thomas_H._Jukes","Non-Darwinian_Evolution","Genome","Fitness_(biology)","Codon","Amino_acid","Alanine","Synonymous_substitution","Genetic_drift","Allele","Mutation","Sexual_reproduction","Gamete","Embryo","Fixation_(population_genetics)","Enzyme","DNA_replication","Conserved_sequence","Molecular_clock","Overdispersion","Molecular_biology","Population_genetics","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Directional_selection","Balancing_selection","Polymorphism_(biology)","Genome","Molecular_evolution","Phenotypic","Natural_selection","Genetic_drift","Tomoko_Ohta","Near-neutrality","Null_hypothesis","McDonald-Kreitman_test","Nearly_neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Genetic_hitchhiking","Genetic_drift","RNA","Genotype","Phenotype","Adaptive_Evolution_in_the_Human_Genome","Coalescent_theory","Evolution","Ewens's_sampling_formula","John_H._Gillespie","Molecular_evolution","Nearly_neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution","Peter_Donnelly","Tomoko_Ohta","Unified_neutral_theory_of_biodiversity","Warren_Ewens"]}
