{"cursor":"25186","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'non-communicable disease', or 'NCD', is a medical condition or disease which\nby definition is 'non-infectious' and 'non-transmissible' among people. NCDs may\nbe chronic diseases of long duration and slow progression, or they may result in\nmore rapid death such as some types of sudden stroke. They include autoimmune\ndiseases, heart disease, stroke, many cancers, asthma, diabetes, chronic kidney\ndisease, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, cataracts, and more. While sometimes\n(incorrectly) referred to as synonymous with \"chronic diseases\", NCDs are\ndistinguished only by their non-infectious cause, not necessarily by their\nduration. Some chronic diseases of long duration, such as HIV/AIDS, are caused\nby transmissible infections. Chronic diseases require chronic care management as\ndo all diseases that are slow to develop and of long duration.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reports NCDs to be by far the leading cause\nof mortality in the world, representing over 60% of all deaths. Out of the 36\nmillion people who died from NCDs in 2005, half were under age 70 and half were\nwomen. Of the 57 million global deaths in 2008, 36 million were due\nto NCDs. That is approximately 63% of total deaths worldwide. Risk\nfactors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment are known to\nincrease the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people\ndie because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High\ncholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because\nof high blood pressure. By 2030, deaths due to chronic NCDs are expected to\nincrease to 52 million per year while deaths caused by infectious diseases,\nmaternal and perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies are expected to\ndecline by 7 million per year during the same period.\n","linknr":378,"url":"Non-communicable_disease","recorded":1362505208,"links":18,"instances":["genetics","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":["http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597418_eng.pdf","http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597418_eng.pdf","http://www.who.int/chp/working_paper_growth%20model29may.pdf","http://www.who.int/chp/working_paper_growth%20model29may.pdf"],"categories":["Diseases and disorders","Global health"],"headings":["Causes and risk factors","NCDs and global health","Economics of NCDs","Key NCDs","See also","Further reading","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mosaic","genetics"],["chimera","genetics"],["dominance","genetics"]],"members":["dominance","mosaic","chimera"],"related":["Disease","Autoimmune_disease","Heart_disease","Stroke","Cancer","Asthma","Diabetes_mellitus","Chronic_kidney_disease","Osteoporosis","Alzheimer's_disease","Cataract","Chronic_diseases","HIV/AIDS","Infection","Chronic_care_management","World_Health_Organization","Death","Risk_factor","High_blood_pressure","Risk_factor","Gender","Genetics","Air_pollution","Smoking","Healthy_diet","Sedentary_lifestyle","Hypertension","Obesity","World_Health_Report","Cholesterol","Social_determinants_of_health","Type_2_diabetes","Environmental_disease","Health","Diseases_of_affluence","Cardiovascular_disease","Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Lower_back_pain","Malnutrition","Scurvy","Vitamin_C","Skin_cancer","Genetic_disorders","Genome","Chromosomal_condition","Down_syndrome","Mutation","Cystic_fibrosis","Mosaic_(genetics)","Chimera_(genetics)","Heterochromia_iridum","Dominance_(genetics)","Huntington's_disease","Recessive","Tay–Sachs_disease","Diseases_of_affluence","Global_health","World_Health_Organization","United_Nations","Public_health","International_development","United_Nations_General_Assembly","Millennium_Development_Goals","Cardiovascular_disease","Diabetes","Cancer","Respiratory_disease","Health_policy","Health_system","Human_rights","High_income_economy","Infectious_diseases","Low_income_countries","International_dollar","Mental_health","Absenteeism","Presenteeism","Health","Tobacco","Overweight","Obesity","Physical_inactivity","Alcohol","Sexually_transmitted_infection","Air_pollution","Cervical_cancer","Human_papillomavirus","Jerry_Morris","Biomedical_research","Inflammation","C-reactive_protein","Osteoprotegerin","NF-κB","Patient","Tobacco_smoking","Hypercholesterolemia","Obesity","Hypertension","Exercise","Chronic_disease","Global_health","The_INCTR_Challenge_Fund"]}
