{"cursor":"9273","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\ns in an aqueous solution]]\n\nA 'micelle' (pronounced or , plural 'micelles', 'micella', or 'micellae') is an\naggregate of surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid colloid. A typical\nmicelle in aqueous solution forms an aggregate with the hydrophilic \"head\"\nregions in contact with surrounding solvent, sequestering the hydrophobic single-\ntail regions in the micelle centre. This phase is caused by the packing behavior\nof single-tailed lipids in a bilayer. The difficulty filling all the volume of\nthe interior of a bilayer, while accommodating the area per head group forced on\nthe molecule by the hydration of the lipid head group, leads to the formation of\nthe micelle. This type of micelle is known as a normal phase micelle (oil-in-\nwater micelle). Inverse micelles have the head groups at the centre with the\ntails extending out (water-in-oil micelle). Micelles are approximately spherical\nin shape. Other phases, including shapes such as ellipsoids, cylinders, and\nbilayers, are also possible. The shape and size of a micelle is a function of\nthe molecular geometry of its surfactant molecules and solution conditions such\nas surfactant concentration, temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The process of\nforming micelles is known as micellisation and forms part of the Phase behaviour\nof many lipids according to their polymorphism.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Micelles","recorded":1362511914,"links":34,"instances":["biology","biophysics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Supramolecular chemistry","Colloidal chemistry"],"headings":["History","Solvation","Energy of formation","Inverse/reverse micelles","Uses","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg/250px-Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Micelle_scheme-en.svg/250px-Micelle_scheme-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","biophysics"],["polymorphism","biophysics"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","polymorphism"],"related":["Aqueous","Surfactant","Colloid","Aqueous_solution","Hydrophilic","Solvent","Hydrophobic","Lipid_bilayer_phase_behavior","Lipids","Lipid_bilayer","Polymorphism_(biophysics)","Bilayer","Temperature","PH","Ionic_strength","Phase_behaviour","Polymorphism_(biophysics)","Detergent","James_William_McBain","University_of_Bristol","Sodium_palmitate","Hydrogen_bonds","Clathrate_hydrate","Ice","Crystal","Counterion","Critical_micelle_concentration","Krafft_temperature","Thermodynamics","Spontaneous_process","Entropy","Enthalpy","Hydrophobic_effect","Non-polar","Critical_micelle_concentration","Emulsifier","Detergent","Surface_tension","Emulsion_polymerization","Bile_acid","Targeted_drug_delivery","Liposome","Vesicle_(biology)","Lipid_bilayer","Surfactant"]}
