{"cursor":"16692","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the mathematical field of complex analysis, a 'branch point' of a multi-\nvalued function (usually referred to as a \"multifunction\" in the context of\ncomplex analysis) is a point such that the function is discontinuous when going\naround an arbitrarily small circuit around this point . Multi-valued functions\nare rigorously studied using Riemann surfaces, and the formal definition of\nbranch points employs this concept.\n\nBranch points fall into three broad categories: algebraic branch points,\ntranscendental branch points, and logarithmic branch points. Algebraic branch\npoints most commonly arise from functions in which there is an ambiguity in the\nextraction of a root, such as solving the equation z = w 2\nfor w as a function of z. Here the branch point is the origin, because the\nanalytic continuation of any solution around a closed loop containing the origin\nwill result in a different function: there is non-trivial monodromy. Despite the\nalgebraic branch point, the function w is well-defined as a multiple-valued\nfunction and, in an appropriate sense, is continuous at the origin. This is in\ncontrast to transcendental and logarithmic branch points, that is, points at\nwhich a multiple-valued function has nontrivial monodromy and an essential\nsingularity. In geometric function theory, unqualified use of the term branch\npoint typically means the former more restrictive kind: the algebraic branch\npoints. In other areas of complex analysis, the unqualified term may\nalso refer to the more general branch points of transcendental type.\n","linknr":207,"url":"Branch_cut","recorded":1362674372,"links":19,"instances":["complex_analysis","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Complex analysis","Inverse functions"],"headings":["Algebraic branch points","Transcendental and logarithmic branch points","Examples","Branch cuts","Riemann surfaces","Algebraic geometry","Puiseux series","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/4/9/b49b86ae9cee07ca674a070660d85d14.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/8/7685bee473ec186175d725e23b0fb160.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Riemann_surface_log.jpg/220px-Riemann_surface_log.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/8/7/a87eaf9ccb68133d27773e1124e84f70.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/9/d/49d5eee13893f8a092ed6778dc523dc2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/d/c/3dcb302b19941867797a86ffd148ef41.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/0/d200d7b8a906ec2f63f300edb689331d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/4/31412501acc5ae91fca5921032b65dc9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/0/9/90951c0096b3e323825f437d4dcb8b7a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/f/7efcbdcbafa78a8df5fe64c40e5b9d80.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["critical_point","mathematics"],["pole","complex_analysis"],["annulus","mathematics"],["pole","complex_analysis"],["pole","complex_analysis"]],"members":["pole","annulus","critical_point"],"related":["Mathematics","Complex_analysis","Multivalued_function","Discontinuous_function","Arbitrarily_small","Riemann_surface","Analytic_continuation","Monodromy","Essential_singularity","Geometric_function_theory","Open_set","Complex_plane","Holomorphic_function","Critical_point_(mathematics)","Limit_point","Winding_number","Critical_value","Inverse_function","Global_analytic_function","Abuse_of_terminology","Implicit_function","Riemann_surface","Pole_(complex_analysis)","Monodromy","Annulus_(mathematics)","Essential_singularity","Analytic_continuation","Complex_logarithm","Square_root","Circle","Radius","Complex_plane","Natural_logarithm","Trigonometry","Pole_(complex_analysis)","Pole_(complex_analysis)","Riemann_surface","Ramification","Monodromy","Algebraic_function","Differential_equation","Countability","Riemann_surface","Riemann_sphere","Covering_space","Local_coordinates","Algebraic_geometry","Algebraic_curve","Field_extension","Local_parameter","Valuation_ring"]}
