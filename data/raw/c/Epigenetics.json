{"cursor":"64523","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn biology, and specifically genetics, 'epigenetics' is the study of changes in\ngene expression or cellular phenotype, caused by mechanisms other than changes\nin the underlying DNA sequence â hence the name epi- (Greek: ÎµÏÎ¯- over,\nabove, outer) -[[genetics]], some of which are heritable.\n\nIt refers to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not\ninvolve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are\nDNA methylation and histone modification, both of which serve to regulate gene\nexpression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes may\nremain through cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life and may also\nlast for multiple generations. However, there is no change in the underlying DNA\nsequence of the organism; instead, non-genetic\nfactors cause the organism's genes to behave (or \"express themselves\")\ndifferently. There are objections to the use of the term epigenetic\nto describe chemical modification of histone, since it remains unclear whether\nor not histone modifications are heritable.\n\nOne example of epigenetic changes in eukaryotic biology is the process of\ncellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the\nvarious pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully\ndifferentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg cell â the zygote\nâ changes into the many cell types including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium,\nendothelium of blood vessels, etc. as it continues to divide. It does so by\nactivating some genes while inhibiting others.\n\nIn 2011, it was demonstrated that the methylation of mRNA has a critical role in\nhuman energy homeostasis. The obesity associated FTO gene is shown to be able to\ndemethylate N6-methyladenosine in RNA. This opened the related field of RNA\nepigenetics.\n","linknr":1046,"url":"Epigenetics","recorded":1362505350,"links":52,"instances":["genetics","genetics","genetics","journal","prion","biology","gene","biology","biology","geneticist"],"pdf":["http://cromatina.icb.ufmg.br/biomol/seminarios/outros/grupo_open.pdf","http://cromatina.icb.ufmg.br/biomol/seminarios/outros/grupo_open.pdf","http://physiology.eajbs.eg.net/pdf/vol2.n2/13.pdf"],"categories":["Epigenetics|","Genetic
