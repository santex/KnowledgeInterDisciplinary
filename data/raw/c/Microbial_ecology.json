{"cursor":"11565","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Microbial ecology' is the ecology of microorganisms: their relationship with\none another and with their environment. It concerns the three major domains of\nlife â Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria â as well as viruses.\n\nMicroorganisms, by their omnipresence, impact the entire biosphere. Microbial\nlife plays a primary role in regulating biogeochemical systems in virtually all\nof our planet's environments, including some of the most extreme, from frozen\nenvironments and acidic lakes, to hydrothermal vents at the bottom of deepest\noceans, and some of the most familiar, such as the human small intestine. As a consequence of the quantitative\nmagnitude of microbial life (Whitman and coworkers calculated cells, eight\norders of magnitude greater than the number of stars in the observable universe\n ) microbes, by virtue of their\nbiomass alone, constitute the single largest carbon sink.\nAside from carbon fixation, microorganismsâ key collective metabolic processes\n(including nitrogen fixation, methane metabolism, and sulfur metabolism) control\nglobal biogeochemical cycling. The immensity of\nmicroorganismsâ production is such that, even in the total absence of eukaryotic\nlife these processes would likely continue unchanged.\n","linknr":680,"url":"Microbial_ecology","recorded":1362505716,"links":28,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Microbiology terms","Bacteria","Bacteriology","Environmental soil science","Membrane biology","Biological matter","Environmental microbiology","Microbial population biology"],"headings":["History","Symbiosis","Roles","Microbial resource management","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Issoria_lathonia.jpg/32px-Issoria_lathonia.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Estuary-mouth.jpg/140px-Estuary-mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Maldivesfish2.jpg/140px-Maldivesfish2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain","biology"],["mutualism","biology"]],"members":["mutualism","domain"],"related":["Ecology","Microorganism","Domain_(biology)","Eukaryote","Archaea","Bacteria","Virus","Biosphere","Biogeochemistry","Extremophiles","Antarctica","Hydrothermal_vents","Small_intestine","Carbon_sink","Nitrogen_fixation","Methanogenesis","Sulfur_metabolism","Martinus_Beijerinck","Enrichment_culture","Microbe","Lourens_Baas_Becking","Sergei_Winogradsky","Microorganisms","Environmental_microbiology","Chemosynthesis","Winogradsky_column","Habitat","Robert_Hungate","Rumen","Catabolic_pathway","Symbiosis","Mutualism_(biology)","Parasitism","Chloroplasts","Photosynthesis","Cyanobacteria","Bacteria","Snowball_Earth","Ecosystem","Microbe","Carbon","Organism","Decomposer","Nutrient","Nitrogen_cycle","Phosphorus_cycle","Carbon_cycle","Nitrogen","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Evolution","Biotechnology","Economic","Community_Fingerprinting","Biodiversity","Carbon_dioxide","Methanogenesis","Global_warming","Bioenergy","Microbial_fuel_cell","Disease","Biological_control_agent","Microbial_communities","Antibiotic_resistance","Environmental_microbiology","International_Society_for_Microbial_Ecology"]}
