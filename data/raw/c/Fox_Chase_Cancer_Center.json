The main\nfacilities of the center are located on property adjoining Burholme Park. The\ncenter is an independent, non-profit institution which specializes in the\ntreatment and prevention of cancer.\n\nThe center was formed in 1974 by the merger of the 'American Oncologic\nHospital', which was founded in 1904 as the first cancer hospital in the United\nStates, and the 'Institute for Cancer Research', founded in 1927.\n\nToday it has almost 2,400 employees and an operating budget of $281.7 million\nfor fiscal year 2006. Research is conducted in more than 80 laboratories by a\nstaff of more than 325 physicians and scientists who hold medical degrees,\nPh.D.s or both.\n\nFox Chase's 100-bed hospital is one of the few facilities in the country devoted\nentirely to cancer care. Annual hospital admissions average about 4,100 and\noutpatient visits to physicians exceed 69,000 a year. As of 2011, the Fox Chase\nCancer Center was ranked as the thirty-eighth best cancer hospital in the United\nStates by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nIn 1995, Fox Chase also became a founding member of the National\nComprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 21 of the nationâs leading\nacademic cancer centers.\n\nOn December 15, 2011, Fox Chase Cancer Center and Temple University Health\nsystem signed an affiliation agreement. Under the agreement, Fox\nChase will connect and extend its current operations into the adjoining 176-bed\nand 33-acre Jeanes Hospital, which is already a part of the Temple University\nHealth System. The entire campus of Fox Chase and Jeanes Hospital will become\nthe \"Cancer Hub\" of the Temple University Health System. The merger is expected\nto close in the summer of 2012.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Fox_Chase_Cancer_Center","recorded":1362572530,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Medical research institutes","Research institutes in the United States","Cancer hospitals","Cancer organizations"],"headings":["History of Research Advances at Fox Chase Cancer Center","Notable Current and Former Fox Chase Cancer Center Researchers","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Logo-text-200px.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Libertybell_alone_small.jpg/22px-Libertybell_alone_small.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Comprehensive_Cancer_Center","National_Cancer_Institute","Comprehensive_Cancer_Center","Fox_Chase,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania","Philadelphia","Pennsylvania","United_States","Burholme_Park","U.S._News_&_World_Report","National_Comprehensive_Cancer_Network","Beatrice_Mintz","National_Foundation_for_Cancer_Research","Kyoto_Prize","Alfred_G._Knudson","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Irwin_Rose","Aaron_Ciechanover","Avram_Hershko","Beatrice_Mintz","Mitosis","SCID_mouse","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Baruch_Blumberg","Transgenic","Hepatitis_B_vaccine","Hepatitis_B_virus","Philadelphia_chromosome","University_of_Pennsylvania","Cloning","Robert_William_Briggs","Rana_pipiens","Vitamin_B12","Helen_M._Berman","Protein_Data_Bank","Baruch_Blumberg","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","V._Craig_Jordan","Tamoxifen","Alfred_G._Knudson","Knudson_hypothesis","Kyoto_Prize","Lasker_Award","Beatrice_Mintz","United_States_National_Academy_of_Sciences","Pontifical_Academy_of_Sciences","Arthur_Lindo_Patterson","Patterson_function","Irwin_Rose","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Ubiquitin","Protein_degradation","Shirley_M._Tilghman","Princeton_University"]}
