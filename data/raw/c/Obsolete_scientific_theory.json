{"cursor":"12501","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'superseded', or 'obsolete, scientific theory' is a scientific theory that was\nonce commonly accepted but that is no longer considered the most complete\ndescription of reality by a mainstream scientific consensus, or a theory which\nhas been shown to be false. This label does not cover protoscientific or fringe\nscience theories with limited support in the scientific community, nor does it\ndescribe theories that were never widely accepted. Some theories which were only\nsupported under specific political authorities, such as Lysenkoism, may also be\ndescribed as obsolete or superseded.\n\nIn some cases a theory or idea is found to be baseless and is simply discarded:\nfor example, the phlogiston theory was entirely replaced by the quite different\nconcept of energy and related laws. In other cases an existing theory is\nreplaced by a new theory which retains significant elements of the earlier\ntheory; in these cases, the older theory is often still useful for many\npurposes, and may be more easily understood than the complete theory and lead to\nsimpler calculations. An example of this is the use of Newtonian physics, which\ndiffers from the currently accepted relativistic physics by a factor which is\nnegligibly small at velocities much lower than that of light. All of Newtonian\nphysics is so satisfactory for most purposes that it is more widely used except\nat velocities not small compared with that of light, and simpler Newtonian but\nnot relativistic mechanics is usually taught in schools. Another case is the\ntheory that the earth is approximately flat; while it has for centuries been\nknown to be wrong for long distances, considering part of the earth's surface as\nflat is usually sufficient for many maps covering areas which are not extremely\nlarge, and surveying.\n\nKarl Popper suggested that a theory should be considered scientific if and only\nif it can in principle be falsified by experiment; any idea not susceptible to\nfalsification does not belong to science. of the universe places the Earth at\nthe centre.]]\n","linknr":407,"url":"Obsolete_scientific_theory","recorded":1362483069,"links":23,"instances":["science","pregnancy","vision"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Obsolete scientific theories|","History of science"],"headings":["Superseded theories","Obsolete branches of enquiry","Theories now considered to be incomplete","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Cellarius_ptolemaic_system_c2.jpg/220px-Cellarius_ptolemaic_system_c2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Libr0310.jpg/220px-Libr0310.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["telegony","pregnancy"],["emission_theory","vision"],["uniformitarianism","science"]],"members":["uniformitarianism","telegony","emission_theory"],"related":["Scientific_theory","Scientific_consensus","Protoscience","Fringe_science","Scientific_community","Lysenkoism","Phlogiston_theory","Newtonian_physics","Relativistic_physics","Karl_Popper","Falsifiability","Spontaneous_generation","Transmutation_of_species","Lamarckism","Inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics","Darwinian_evolution","Mendelian_genetics","Epigenetics","Mendelian_genetics","Classical_genetics","Boveri–Sutton_chromosome_theory","Molecular_genetics","Maternal_impression","Birth_defects","Genetics","Fetal_origins_of_adult_disease","Genomic_imprinting","Miasma_theory_of_disease","Germ_theory_of_disease","Preformationism","Gamete","Microscopy","Cell_biology","DNA","Atomic_theory","Recapitulation_theory","Baer's_laws_of_embryology","Telegony_(pregnancy)","Racism","Vitalism","Organic_chemistry","Biochemistry","Molecular_biology","Friedrich_Wöhler","Out_of_Asia_theory","Caloric_theory","Classical_element","Phlogiston_theory","Antoine_Laurent_Lavoisier","Dalton's_law","Emission_theory_(vision)","Ibn_al-Haytham","Aristotelian_physics","Newtonian_physics","Ptolemy","Refraction","Snell's_law","Luminiferous_aether","Michelson-Morley_experiment","Albert_Einstein","Caloric_theory","Lavoisier","Benjamin_Thompson","James_Joule","Vis_viva","Gottfried_Leibniz","Static_electricity","Potential_difference","Emitter_theory","Atomic_theory","Plum_pudding_model","Rutherford_model","Bohr_model","Electron_cloud","Quantum_mechanics","Atomic_orbital","Classical_physics","Newtonian_physics","Relativistic_physics","Quantum_physics","Ptolemaic_system","Nicolaus_Copernicus","Geocentric_universe","Heliocentric_universe","Milky_Way","Center_of_mass","Copernican_system","Johannes_Kepler","Isaac_Newton","Newtonian_gravity","General_relativity","Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury","Luminiferous_aether","Steady_State_Theory","Hermann_Bondi","Thomas_Gold","Fred_Hoyle","Metric_expansion_of_space","Steady_state","Big_Bang","Flat_Earth","Map_projection","Hollow_Earth","Open_Polar_Sea","North_Pole","Rain_follows_the_plow","Plate_tectonics","Expanding_Earth_theory","Geosyncline","Continental_drift","Catastrophism","Uniformitarianism_(science)","Neptunism","Plutonism","Behaviorist","Language_acquisition","Blank_slate","Humorism","Eclectic_Medicine","Alternative_medicine","Physiognomy","Phrenology","Alchemy","Chemistry","Astrology","Astronomy","Phrenology","Pseudoscience","Numerology","Pseudoscience","Reality","Atomic_nucleus","High_energy_physics","Newtonian_mechanics","Theory_of_relativity","Quantum_mechanics","Speed_of_light","Engineering","Classical_electrodynamics","Quantum_electrodynamics","Bohr_model","Newton's_sine-square_law_of_air_resistance","Force","Fluid","Hypersonic_flow","Scientific_theory","Philosophy_of_science","Protoscience","Fringe_science","Pathological_science","Paradigm_shift","History_of_evolutionary_thought","Creation–evolution_controversy","List_of_discredited_substances","List_of_famous_discoveries","List_of_famous_experiments","List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience"]}
