{"cursor":"5562","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cycle' has several meanings in the field of music. Acoustically, it refers to\none complete vibration, the base unit of Hertz being one cycle per\nsecond. Randel, Don. The Harvard Dictionary of Music. Belknap, 1986. p.\n218. Theoretically, an interval cycle is a collection of pitch classes\ncreated by a sequence of identical intervals. Individual pieces that aggregate\ninto larger works are considered cycles. This definition can apply to everything\nfrom settings of the Mass or a song cycle to an opera cycle. Cycle also applies\nto the complete performance of an individual composer's work in one\ngenre. \"cycle.\" In The Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Alison Latham.\nOxford Music Online,\nhttp://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e7623 (accessed\nDecember 25, 2011).\n\nA cycle can also mean a section which is repeated or repeatable indefinitely,\nwith the end of a preceding repetition leading to the beginning of a succeeding\nrepetition. Cycles may be melodic, harmonic, rhythmic, or based on some other\nmusical dimension. Cycles may begin at any point in a composition or in relation\nto another cycle, contain or consist of cycles, and may be varied upon\nrepetition.\n\nHarmonic cycles are at the root of many musical genres, such as the twelve-bar\nblues. In compositions of this genre, the chord progression may be repeated\nindefinitely, with melodic and lyrical variation forming the musical interest.\nThe form theme and variations is essentially of this type, but generally on a\nlarger scale.\n\nComposition using a tone row is another example of a cycle of pitch\nmaterial, although it may be more difficult to hear because the variations\nare more diverse.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Cycle_(music)","recorded":1362477306,"links":12,"instances":["music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical techniques","Musical form"],"headings":["Rhythmic cycles","Mixed cycles","Opera cycles","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/FClef.svg/40px-FClef.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["section","music"],["repetition","music"],["variation","music"],["tala","music"],["period","music"],["cell","music"],["period","music"],["dynamics","music"],["articulation","music"],["register","music"]],"members":["tala","variation","period","section","articulation","register","repetition","cell","dynamics"],"related":["Music","Hertz","Interval_cycle","Song_cycle","Section_(music)","Repetition_(music)","Melody","Harmony","Rhythm","Variation_(music)","Twelve-bar_blues","Chord_progression","Theme_and_variations","Tone_row","Indian_classical_music","Tala_(music)","Gamelan","Gong","Colotomy","Gagaku","Pi_phat","Rhythm_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa","Cross_beat","Period_(music)","Cell_(music)","Cross_beat","African_diaspora","Bell_pattern","Period_(music)","Isorhythm","Relatively_prime","Serial_music","Dynamics_(music)","Articulation_(music)","Timbre","Register_(music)","Richard_Wagner","Opera","Robert_Ashley","R._Murray_Schafer","Musical_theatre","Karlheinz_Stockhausen","Circle_of_fifths"]}
