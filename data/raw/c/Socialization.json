Socialization is thus âthe means by\nwhich social and cultural continuity are attainedâ. Clausen, John A. (ed.)\n(1968) Socialization and Society, Boston: Little Brown and Company.\np5 Macionis, Gerber, Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. (Pearson Canada Inc.,\n2010)pg.104\n\nSocialization describes a process which may lead to desirable, or 'moral',\noutcomes in the opinion of said society. Individual views on certain issues,\nsuch as race or economics, are influenced by the view of the society at large\nand become a \"normal,\" and acceptable outlook or value to have within a society.\nMany socio-political theories postulate that socialization provides only a\npartial explanation for human beliefs and behaviors, maintaining that agents are\nnot 'blank slates' predetermined by their environment.
