{"cursor":"93332","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n form the Rubik's Cube group.]]\n\nIn mathematics, a 'group' is a set of elements together with an operation that\ncombines any two of its elements to form a third element also in the set. One of\nthe most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the\naddition operation; the addition of any two integers forms another integer. To\nqualify as a group, the set and the operation must satisfy four conditions\ncalled the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and\ninvertibility. The abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is\nfrom the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, allows\nentities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond\nto be handled in a flexible way, while retaining their essential structural\naspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics\nmakes them a central organizing principle of contemporary\nmathematics. : \"The idea of a group is one which pervades the\nwhole of mathematics both pure and applied.\"\n\nGroups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry. For example, a\nsymmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object: the group\nconsists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged, and the\noperation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the\nother. Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle\nphysics; Point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in\nmolecular chemistry; and PoincarÃ© groups can express the physical symmetry\nunderlying special relativity.\n\nThe concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations, starting\nwith Ãvariste Galois in the 1830s. After contributions from other fields such as\nnumber theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly\nestablished around 1870. Modern group theoryâa very active mathematical\ndisciplineâstudies groups in their own right. To explore groups, mathematicians\nhave devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable\npieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to\ntheir abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in\nwhich a group can be expressed concretely (its group representations), both from\na theoretical and a computational point of view. A particularly rich theory has\nbeen developed for finite groups, which culminated with the monumental\nclassification of finite simple groups announced in 1983. Since the mid-1980s,\ngeometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric\nobjects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.\n","linknr":1449,"url":"Group_(Mathematics)","recorded":1362671688,"links":104,"instances":["geometry","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","group_theory","mathematics","algebra","group_theory","mathematics","mathematics","set_theory","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","group_theory","mathematics","descent_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","algebra","set_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.ams.org/notices/200407/fea-aschbacher.pdf","http://www.ams.org/notices/200407/fea-aschbacher.pdf"],"categories":["Algebraic
