{"cursor":"36454","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'human leukocyte antigen (HLA)' system is the name of the major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. The super locus contains a large\nnumber of genes related to immune system function in humans. This group of genes\nresides on chromosome 6, and encodes cell-surface antigen-presenting proteins\nand has many other functions. The HLA genes are the human versions of the MHC\ngenes that are found in most vertebrates (and thus are the most studied of the\nMHC genes). The proteins encoded by certain genes are also known as antigens, as\na result of their historic discovery as factors in organ transplants. The major\nHLA antigens are essential elements for immune function. Different classes have\ndifferent functions:\n\nHLAs corresponding to MHC class I ('[[HLA-A|A]]', '[[HLA-B|B]]', and '[[HLA-\nC|C]]') present peptides from inside the cell (including viral peptides if\npresent). These peptides are produced from digested proteins that are broken\ndown in the proteasomes. In general, these particular peptides are small\npolymers, about 9 amino acids in length. Foreign antigens attract killer T-cells\n(also called CD8 positive- or cytotoxic T-cells) that destroy cells.\n\nHLAs corresponding to MHC class II ('[[HLA-DP|DP]]', '[[HLA-DM|DM]]', '[[HLA-\nDOA|DOA]]', '[[HLA-DOB|DOB]]', '[[HLA-DQ|DQ]]', and '[[HLA-DR|DR]]') present\nantigens from outside of the cell to T-lymphocytes. These particular antigens\nstimulate the multiplication of T-helper cells, which in turn stimulate antibody-\nproducing B-cells to produce antibodies to that specific antigen. Self-antigens\nare suppressed by suppressor T-cells.\n\nHLAs corresponding to MHC class III encode components of the complement system.\n\nHLAs have other roles. They are important in disease defense. They are the major\ncause of organ transplant rejections. They may protect against or fail to\nprotect (if down regulated by an infection) against cancers.\nMutations in HLA may be linked to autoimmune disease (examples: type I diabetes,\ncoeliac disease). HLA may also be related people's perception of the odor of\nother people, and may be involved in mate selection, as at least one study found\na lower than expected rate of HLA similarity between spouses in an isolated\ncommunity.\n\nAside from the genes encoding the 6 major antigen-presenting proteins, there are\na large number of other genes, many involved in immune function, located on the\nHLA complex. Diversity of HLAs in the human population is one aspect of disease\ndefense, and, as a result, the chance of two unrelated individuals with\nidentical HLA molecules on all loci is very low. HLA genes have historically\nbeen identified as a result of the ability to successfully transplant organs\nbetween HLA-similar individuals.\n","linknr":467,"url":"Human_leukocyte_antigen","recorded":1362482117,"links":33,"instances":["biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immune system","Immunology","Human MHC haplogroups|0","Genes on chromosome 6"],"headings":["Functions","Classification","Role of allelic variation","Antibodies","HLA matching for sick siblings","See also","Further reading","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/HLA.svg/230px-HLA.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/DR_beta_1_SEI_topdown.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/MHC_Class_1.svg/150px-MHC_Class_1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/DQ_Illustration.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/MHC_expression.svg/300px-MHC_expression.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["locus","genetics"],["locus","genetics"],["cell","biology"],["locus","genetics"]],"members":["cell","locus"],"related":["Major_histocompatibility_complex","Locus_(genetics)","Immune_system","Chromosome_6","Antigen","History_and_naming_of_human_leukocyte_antigens","Proteasome","Polymer","Amino_acid","Killer_T-cell","CD8","T-helper_cell","Antibody","B_cell","Regulatory_T_cell","Complement_system","Cancer","Autoimmune_disease","Type_I_diabetes","Coeliac_disease","Locus_(genetics)","Protein","Immune_system","Pathogen","Cell_(biology)","Antigen-presenting_cell","Phagocytosis","Peptide","MHC_class_II","Antigen-presenting_cell","T_cell","Virus","MHC_class_I","MHC_restriction","Transplant_rejection","Relative_risk","HLA-B27","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Postgonococcal_arthritis","Post-salmonella_arthritis","Acute_anterior_uveitis","HLA-B47","Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia_due_to_21-hydroxylase_deficiency","HLA-DR2","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","HLA-DR3","Autoimmune_hepatitis","Sjögren_syndrome","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","HLA-DR4","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Autoimmune_disorder","Type_I_diabetes","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Coeliac_disease","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Myasthenia_gravis","Inclusion_body_myositis","Sjögren_syndrome","Serotyping","Celiac_disease","HLA-A","HLA-B","HLA-C","HLA-E","HLA-F","HLA-G","Beta-2_microglobulin","Antigen-presenting_cells","HLA-DP","HLA-DPB1","HLA-DQ","HLA-DQA1","HLA-DQB1","HLA-DR","Antigen-presenting_cell","Balancing_selection","Gene_conversion","Tissue_Antigens","Sequence_Feature_Variant_Type","HLA-B27","Allele","Locus_(genetics)","MHC_class_I","MHC_class_II","CRC_Press","HLA_A1-B8-DR3-DQ2","Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation","Preimplantation_genetic_diagnosis","HCP5","List_of_human_leukocyte_antigen_alleles_associated_with_cutaneous_conditions","European_Bioinformatics_Institute","The_Anthony_Nolan_Trust"]}
