{"cursor":"10497","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nAn 'electronic portfolio', also known as an 'e-portfolio' or 'digital\nportfolio', is a collection of electronic evidence assembled and managed by a\nuser, usually on the Web. Such electronic evidence may include inputted text,\nelectronic files, images, multimedia, blog entries, and hyperlinks. E-portfolios\nare both demonstrations of the user's abilities and platforms for self-\nexpression, and, if they are online, they can be maintained dynamically over\ntime. Some e-portfolio applications permit varying degrees of audience access,\nso the same portfolio might be used for multiple purposes. According to\nAnderson, e-portfolios can then go viral and be passed on to be easily viewed by\nmany on the web.\n\nE-portfolios also help to foster an independent and autonomous way of thinking,\naccording to Strivens. This is in large part because people must focus on their\ncollective work, think about how it will be portrayed, and what the work says\nabout them as an individual. The individual is then in charge of their learning\nand the choice of where to demonstrate their proficiency.) People are also\nforced to reflect on what they have learned and how they plan to build and\nimprove in the future. This helps people to become more critical thinkers and\nhelps them to develop their writing and multimedia skills. Today, many students\nare using multimedia such as: Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and texting. These are\nall informal settings where students must get their point across. The electronic\nportfolio on the other hand is a more formal setting where students must apply\nboth their knowledge of how the web works and the message that they want to\nconvey. In this sense, studentâs use and comfort with the web at times can he a\nhindrance if they are not taught to use electronic portfolios in the correct\nfashion suggests Lane. Many universities and schools are currently working to\nmake sure that students are gaining practice and experience with electronic\nportfolios so that they are able to use them to the best of their ability. For\nexample, in places like Michigan, students can earn the MCOATT (Michigan\nCertificate of Outstanding Achievement in Teaching Technology) for submitting an\nelectronic portfolio which demonstrates evidence of technology being used in the\nclassroom. This consortium is an organization aimed to make Michigan one of the\nleaders in integrating technology into the training of young professionals.\n\nAn e-portfolio can be seen as a type of learning record that provides actual\nevidence of achievement. Learning records are closely related to the Learning\nPlan, an emerging tool that is being used to manage learning by individuals,\nteams, communities of interest, and organizations. To the extent that a Personal\nLearning Environment captures and displays a learning record, it also might be\nunderstood to be an electronic portfolio.\n\nStudents have been taught to create digital identities using presentation\nsoftware or tools to create web pages. More recently the use of virtual learning\nenvironments (VLEs) in schools and universities has led to an increased activity\nin the creation of e-portfolios for a variety of reasons. Most of these e-\nportfolios, however, are retained within the VLE and are not easily accessed\noutside the VLE. This results in problems of exporting data and related\ninteroperability issues. An alternative approach is to use a system externally\nhosted to any institution. This permits transition through the various stages of\neducation and employments and even into retirement.\n\nE-portfolios, like traditional portfolios, can facilitate students' reflection\non their own learning, leading to more awareness of learning strategies and\nneeds. Results of a comparative research, by M. van Wesel and Prop,\nbetween paper based portfolios and electronic portfolios in the same setting,\nsuggest use of an electronic portfolio leads to better learning\noutcomes.\n","linknr":154,"url":"Electronic_portfolio","recorded":1364172861,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:LEAD","/wiki/Wikipedia:Layout_guide","/wiki/Wikipedia:Lead_section_guidelines","/wiki/World_Wide_Web","/wiki/Multimedia","/wiki/Blog","/wiki/Hyperlink","/wiki/Learning_Plan","/wiki/Community_of_interest","/wiki/Personal_Learning_Environment","/wiki/Virtual_learning_environment","/wiki/Career_portfolio","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Maarten_van_Wesel","#cite_note-2","#Types","#Usage","#Services","#Education","#Professional","#General_Art_.2F_Hobbyist","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Rubric_(academic)","/wiki/Career_portfolio","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/School","/wiki/Technology_Integration","/wiki/Higher_education","/wiki/Group_therapy","/wiki/Recognition_of_prior_learning","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=3","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=CollegeOnTrack&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Desire2Learn","/wiki/Digication","/wiki/E-scape","/wiki/Educa","/wiki/Elgg_(software)","/w/index.php?title=FolioSpaces_(free_host)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Foliotek_(software)","/wiki/Mahara_(software)","/wiki/MAPS_(software)","/w/index.php?title=Oscar_(software)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pass-port","/wiki/Rcampus","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Behance","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/DeviantArt","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Career_portfolio","/wiki/Artist%27s_portfolio","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-1","http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/York/documents/resources/resourcedatabase/id69_guide_for_busy_academics_no4.doc","http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/York/documents/resources/resourcedatabase/id69_guide_for_busy_academics_no4.doc","#cite_ref-2","http://www.personeel.unimaas.nl/maarten.wesel/Documenten/The%20influence%20of%20portfolio%20media%20on%20student%20perceptions%20and%20learning%20outcomes.PDF","http://www.personeel.unimaas.nl/maarten.wesel/Documenten/The%20influence%20of%20portfolio%20media%20on%20student%20perceptions%20and%20learning%20outcomes.PDF","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0070955697","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0787958719","/wiki/Special:BookSources/1591408903","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-3-8365-0498-0","/wiki/OCLC","//www.worldcat.org/oclc/449678340","http://www.coatt.net/","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit&section=9","http://electronicportfolios.com/myportfolio/versions.html","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&oldid=543674511","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Educational_materials","/wiki/Category:Educational_software","/wiki/Category:Educational_technology","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_introduction_cleanup_from_July_2012","/wiki/Category:All_pages_needing_cleanup","/wiki/Category:Articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify_from_July_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_covered_by_WikiProject_Wikify","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Electronic+portfolio&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Electronic+portfolio","/wiki/Electronic_portfolio","/wiki/Talk:Electronic_portfolio","#","/wiki/Electronic_portfolio","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Electronic_portfolio&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents",
