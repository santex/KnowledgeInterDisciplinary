{"cursor":"65368","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Synthetic fuel' or 'synfuel' is a liquid fuel obtained from coal, natural gas,\noil shale, or biomass. It may also refer to fuels derived from other solids such\nas plastics or rubber waste. It may also (less often) refer to gaseous fuels\nproduced in a similar way. Common use of the term \"synthetic fuel\" is to\ndescribe fuels manufactured via Fischer Tropsch conversion, methanol to gasoline\nconversion, or direct coal liquefaction.\n\nJuly 2009 worldwide commercial synthetic fuels production capacity is over ,\nwith numerous new projects in construction or
