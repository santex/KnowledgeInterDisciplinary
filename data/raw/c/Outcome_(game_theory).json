{"cursor":"2183","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn game theory, an 'outcome' is a set of moves or strategies taken by the\nplayers, or it is their payoffs resulting from the actions or strategies taken\nby all players. The two are complementary in that, given knowledge of the set of\nstrategies of all players, the final state of the game is known, as are any\nrelevant payoffs. In a game where chance or a random event is involved, the\noutcome is not known from only the set of strategies, but is only realized when\nthe random event(s) are realized.\n\nA set of payoffs can be considered a set of N-tuples, where N is the number of\nplayers in the game, and the cardinality of the set is equal to the total number\nof possible outcomes when the strategies of the players are varied. The payoff\nset can thus be partially ordered, where the partial ordering comes from the\nvalue of each entry in the N-tuple. How players interact to allocate the payoffs\namong themselves is a fundamental aspect of economics.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Outcome_(game_theory)","recorded":1362576145,"links":17,"instances":["probability","game_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Game theory"],"headings":["Choosing among outcomes","Applications"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Ultimatum_Game_Extensive_Form.svg/40px-Ultimatum_Game_Extensive_Form.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["strategy","game_theory"],["realization","probability"]],"members":["realization","strategy","set"],"related":["Game_theory","Set_(mathematics)","Strategy_(game_theory)","Realization_(probability)","Partially_ordered_set","Economics","Pareto_efficient","Economic_equilibrium","Nash_equilibrium","Implementation_theory","Mechanism_design"]}
