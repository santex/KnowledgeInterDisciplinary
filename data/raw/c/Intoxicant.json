{"cursor":"47471","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'psychoactive drug', 'psychopharmaceutical', or 'psychotropic' is a chemical\nsubstance that crosses the bloodâbrain barrier and acts primarily upon the\ncentral nervous system where it affects brain function, resulting in alterations\nin perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, and behavior. These substances may be used recreationally, to\npurposefully alter one's consciousness, or as entheogens, for ritual, spiritual,\nand/or shamanic purposes, as a tool for studying or augmenting the mind. Some\npsychoactive drugs are also recognized for therapeutic use as anesthetics,\nanalgesics, or for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.\n\nBecause psychoactive substances bring about subjective changes in consciousness\nand mood that the user may find pleasant (e.g. euphoria) or advantageous (e.g.\nincreased alertness), many psychoactive substances are abused, that is, used\nexcessively, despite health risks or negative consequences. With sustained use\nof some substances, psychological and physical dependence (\"addiction\") may\ndevelop, making the cycle of abuse even more difficult to interrupt. Drug\nrehabilitation aims to break this cycle of dependency, through a combination of\npsychotherapy, support groups and even other psychoactive substances. However,\nthe reverse is also true in some cases, that is certain experiences on drugs may\nbe so unfriendly and uncomforting that the user may never want to try the\nsubstance again. This is especially true of the deliriants (e.g. [[Datura\nstramonium|Jimson weed]]) and powerful dissociatives (e.g. [[Salvia\ndivinorum]]). Most purely psychedelic drugs are considered to be non-addictive\n(LSD, psilocybin, mescaline etc.); \"psychedelic amphetamines\" or empathogen-\nentactogens (such as MDA, MDMA etc.) may produce an additional stimulant and/or\neuphoriant effect, and thus have an addiction potential.\n\nIn part because of this potential for abuse and dependency, the ethics of drug\nuse are the subject of debate. Many governments worldwide place restrictions on\ndrug production and sales in an attempt to decrease drug abuse. Ethical concerns\nhave also been raised about over-use of these drugs clinically, and about their\nmarketing by manufacturers.\n","linknr":2403,"url":"Intoxicant","recorded":1362479223,"links":77,"instances":["medicine","pharmacy","emotion","drug","mood","medicine","psychology","narcotic","medicine","pharmacy"],"pdf":["http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/en/Neuroscience_E.pdf","http://law.wustl.edu/Journal/22/p29Barnett.pdf","http://www.bostonneuropsa.org/PDF%20Files/Johnson.pdf","http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1961_en.pdf","http://epw.senate.gov/title23.pdf","http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/en/Neuroscience_E.pdf"],"categories":["Psychoactive
