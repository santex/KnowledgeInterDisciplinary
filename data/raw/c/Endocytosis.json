{"cursor":"15988","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Endocytosis' is a process by which cells absorb molecules (such as proteins) by\nengulfing them. It is used by all cells of the body because most substances\nimportant to them are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the\nhydrophobic plasma or cell membrane. The process which is the opposite to\nendocytosis is exocytosis. {{cite journal\n| volume = 285 issue = 5425 pages = 215â20 year = 1999 month = July pmid =\n| 10398591 doi = 10.1126/science.285.5425.215 journal = Science url =\n| http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10398591 accessdate =\n| 2009-06-19 title = The Structural Era of Endocytosis last1 = Marsh first1 = M.\n| last2 = McMahon first2 = HT\n}}\n","linknr":329,"url":"Endocytosis","recorded":1362486734,"links":46,"instances":["biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular processes","Membrane biology","Cell anatomy"],"headings":["Endocytosis pathways","Principal components of endocytic pathway","Clathrin-mediated endocytosis","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Endocytosis_types.svg/400px-Endocytosis_types.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor"],"related":["Molecule","Chemical_polarity","Hydrophobic","Cell_membrane","Exocytosis","Clathrin-mediated_endocytosis","Caveolae","Macropinocytosis","Phagocytosis","Proteins","Clathrin","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Low_density_lipoprotein","Transferrin","Growth_factor","Antibody","Caveolin","Cholesterol","Glycolipid","Smooth_muscle","Pneumocyte","Fibroblast","Adipocyte","Endothelial_cell","Cytosol","Endosomes","Lysosomes","Micro-organisms","Apoptotic","Clathrin-mediated_endocytosis","Caveolae","Graf1","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Lysosomes","Phagosomes","Mannose-6-phosphate","Vacuoles","Eisosome","Clathrin","Plasma_membrane","AP2_adaptors","LDL_receptor","Low-density_lipoprotein","Transferrin","Epidermal_growth_factor","Endosomes","Dynamin","Adaptin","Michael_S._Brown","Joseph_L._Goldstein","Barbara_Pearse","Emperipolesis","Exocytosis","Phagocytosis","Active_Transport","Pinocytosis","Receptor-mediated_endocytosis"]}
