Biocides are commonly used in medicine, agriculture, forestry,\nand industry. Biocidal substances and products are also employed as anti-fouling\nagents or disinfectants under other circumstances: chlorine, for example, is\nused as a short-life biocide in industrial water treatment but as a disinfectant\nin swimming pools. Many biocides are synthetic, but a class of 'natural\nbiocides', derived from, e.g., bacteria and plants, includes brassica\noleracea, brassica oleracea gemmifera, and clostridium botulinum bacteria.\n\nA biocide can be:\n* A pesticide: this includes fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, algicides,\n  molluscicides, miticides and rodenticides.\n* An antimicrobial: this includes germicides, antibiotics, antibacterials,\n  antivirals, antifungals, antiprotozoals and antiparasites. See also\n  spermicide.\n\nBiocide can also refer to the destruction of life, a form of omnicide that\naffects every living thing, not just humans; one who wishes that everything in\nthe entire world, or universe, face extinction, is labeled a 'Biocidist', or\nhaving 'biocidal' ideologies.\n","linknr":227,"url":"Biocide","recorded":1362512385,"links":34,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.antimicrobialcopper.com/media/149689/pr811-chilean-subway-installs-antimicrobial-copper.pdf","http://www.mst.dk/udgiv/Publications/2001/87-7944-383-4/pdf/87-7944-384-2.pdf"],"categories":["Pesticides","Pharmaceutical microbiology","Biological pest control","Biological pest control agents","Biocides"],"headings":["Uses","Hazards and environmental risks","Classification","Current market","See also","References","Literature","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_substance","Microorganism","Medicine","Agriculture","Forestry","Industry","Pesticide","Fungicide","Herbicide","Insecticide","Algicide","Molluscicide","Miticide","Rodenticide","Antimicrobial","Germicide","Antibiotic","Antibacterial","Antiviral_drug","Antifungal_medication","Antiprotozoal_agent","Antiparasite","Spermicide","Omnicide","Liquid","Quat","Swimming_pool","Water","Algae","Hypochlorite","Sodium_dichloro-s-triazinetrione","Trichloro-s-triazinetrione","Hypochlorous_acid","Hydantoin","Copper","Brass","Bronze","Cupronickel","Methicillin","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Influenza_A_virus","Adenoviridae","Fungus","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Antimicrobial_copper-alloy_touch_surfaces","Methicillin","Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus","Antimicrobial_copper-alloy_touch_surfaces","Tin","Tributyltin","Navy","Wood_preservation","Rodenticide","Avicide","Molluscicide","Insecticide","Acaricide","Arthropods","Repellent","Antifouling","Embalming","Taxidermist","Non-pesticide_management","Ecological_pesticides"]}
