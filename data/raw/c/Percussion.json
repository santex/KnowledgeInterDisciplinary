The percussion family is believed to include the oldest\nmusical instruments, following the human voice. The Oxford\nCompanion to Music, 10th edition, p775\n\nThe percussion section of an orchestra, however, traditionally contains in\naddition many instruments that are not, strictly speaking, percussion, such as\nwhistles and sirens. On the other hand, keyboard instruments such as the celesta\nare not normally part of the percussion section, but keyboard percussion\ninstruments (which do not have keyboards) are included.\n\nPercussion instruments are most commonly divided into two classes: Pitched\npercussion instruments, which produce notes with an identifiable pitch, and\nunpitched percussion instruments, which produce notes without an identifiable\npitch. http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/thesoundexchange/the_orche-\nstra/sections/percussion/ retrieved 8 March 2012 http://www.miayf.org/percussion/
