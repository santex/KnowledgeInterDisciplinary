{"cursor":"20345","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n]]\n\nIn electricity, a 'corona discharge' is an electrical discharge brought on by\nthe ionization of a fluid surrounding a conductor that is electrically\nenergized. The discharge will occur when the strength (potential gradient) of\nthe electric field around the conductor is high enough to form a conductive\nregion, but not high enough to cause electrical breakdown or arcing to nearby\nobjects. It is often seen as a bluish (or other color) glow in the air adjacent\nto pointed metal conductors carrying high voltages. Spontaneous corona\ndischarges are undesirable where they waste power in high-voltage systems or\nwhere the high chemical activity in a corona discharge creates objectionable or\nhazardous compounds, such as ozone. Controlled corona discharges are used in a\nvariety of filtration, printing and other processes.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Corona_discharge","recorded":1362485728,"links":39,"instances":["physics_articles","physics","ionic_propulsion_device","material","physics","electricity"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrical breakdown","Plasma physics"],"headings":["Introduction","Applications of corona discharge","Problems caused by corona discharges","Mechanism of corona discharge","Electrical properties","Positive coronas","Negative coronas","Examples","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B4.jpg/220px-%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Plasma_wheel_2_med_DSIR2018.jpg/220px-Plasma_wheel_2_med_DSIR2018.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/National_Bureau_of_Standards_high_voltage_laboratory.png/220px-National_Bureau_of_Standards_high_voltage_laboratory.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Corona_Discharge_initiation.svg/461px-Corona_Discharge_initiation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Corona_electrical_breakdown.svg/461px-Corona_electrical_breakdown.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Corona_discharge_upkeep.svg/461px-Corona_discharge_upkeep.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conductor","material"],["plasma","physics"],["plasma","physics"],["lifter","ionic_propulsion_device"],["current","electricity"],["power","physics"],["plasma","physics"],["list_of_plasma","physics_articles"]],"members":["list_of_plasma","plasma","lifter","conductor","power","current"],"related":["Electricity","Electrical_discharge","Ionization","Fluid","Conductor_(material)","Potential_gradient","Electric_field","Electrical_breakdown","Electric_arc","Ozone","Xerography","Potential","Ion","Plasma_(physics)","Electric_charge","Gradient","Electric_field","Electric_arc","Potential_gradient","Plasma_(physics)","Corona_ring","Ion","Electron","Inelastic_collision","Ozone","Ozone","Air-conditioning_systems","Electrostatic_precipitator","Earth's_atmosphere","Polymer","Photocopying","Air_ioniser","Kirlian_photography","EHD_thruster","Lifter_(ionic_propulsion_device)","Ionic_wind","Nitrogen_laser","Polystyrene","Mass_spectrometer","Ion_mobility_spectrometer","Solid-state_fan","Photocopying","Ozone","Electric_power_transmission","NOx","Electric_power_transmission","Ozone","Transformer","Capacitor","Electric_motor","Electrical_generator","Ozone_cracking","Elastomer","O-rings","Static_electricity","Corona_ring","Electric_field","Potential_gradient","Photon","Cosmic_ray","Ion","Electron","Electric_arc","Current_(electricity)","Current_density","Power_(physics)","Plasma_(physics)","Photoelectric_effect","Electronegative","Molecules","Oxygen","Water_vapor","Automotive","Spark_plug","Atmospheric_pressure_chemical_ionization","Dielectric_barrier_discharge","Kirlian_photography","List_of_plasma_(physics)_articles","Ozone","Ozone_cracking","St._Elmo's_fire"]}
