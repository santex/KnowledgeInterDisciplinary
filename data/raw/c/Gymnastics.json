Internationally, all of\n the competitive gymnastic sports are governed by the FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale\n de Gymnastique (FIG). Each country has its own national governing body\n affiliated to FIG. Competitive artistic gymnastics is the best known of the\n gymnastic sports. It typically involves the women's events of uneven bars,\n balance beam, floor exercise, and vault. Men's events are floor exercise,\n pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and high bar. Gymnastics\n evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for\n mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.\n\nOther gymnastic disciplines include: trampolining, Team Gym, tumbling, rhythmic\ngymnastics, aerobic gymnastics and acrobatic gymnastics. Participants can\ninclude children as young as 20 months old doing kindergym and children's\ngymnastics, recreational gymnasts of ages 5 and up, competitive gymnasts at\nvarying levels of skill, and
