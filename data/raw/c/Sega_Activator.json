It was originally released in\nJapan in 1988 as , then in North America in 1989 as Sega Genesis, and in Europe,\nAustralia and other PAL regions in 1990 as Mega Drive. The reason for the two\nnames is that Sega was unable to secure legal rights to the Mega Drive name in\nNorth America. The Sega Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the\nSega Master System with which it has backward compatibility when the separately\nsold Power Base Converter is installed.\n\nThe Sega Genesis was the first of its generation to achieve notable market share\nin continental Europe and North America, where it competed against a wide range\nof platforms, including both dedicated gaming consoles and home computer\nsystems. Two years later, Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment\nSystem, and the competition between the two would dominate the 16-bit era of\nvideo gaming. The console began production in Japan in 1988 and ended with the\nlast new licensed game being released in 2002 in Brazil. The Sega\nGenesis was Sega's most successful console; though Sega has never released a\ntotal sales figure quote. However, this data was originally\nreleased in 1995 before production and sales of the console ended.\nThere is a detailed history of Sega's first party North American sales\n   through 1997 totaling over 20.4 million. A number confirmed by the New York\n   Times' statement \"some 20 million 16-bit Genesis consoles in the United\n   States alone\".\n'North American sales history' 1989-1990: 1.2 million\n   1991: 1.6 million 1992: 4.5 million 1993: 5.5\n   million 1994: over 4 million\n   1995: 2.1 million 1996: 1.1 million 1997: 400,000 Total: over\n   20.4 million |group=sn|name=SalesNote2}} Several add-ons were created\n   including the Sega Mega-CD/Sega CD and Sega 32X which extended its\n   capabilities.\n\nThe controversy over games such as [[Mortal Kombat]] in the United States forced\nSega to create the first content rating system for video games, the Videogame\nRating Council, rather than have the games heavily censored. The rating system\nallowed Sega to ship games with little to no censorship and gave it a\ncompetitive edge when the same game was released by Nintendo. The success of\nthose games eventually forced Nintendo to join its rating system.\n\nThe console and its games continue to be popular among fans, collectors, video\ngame music fans, retro gamers, emulation enthusiasts and the fan translation\nscene. Licensed 3rd party variations of the console are still being\nproduced to this day, and there are also several indie game developers\ncontinuing to produce games for the console. Many games have been re-released\nin compilations for newer consoles, offered for download on various online\nservices, such as Wii Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network\nand Steam.\n","linknr":1517,"url":"Sega_Activator","recorded":1362555076,"links":80,"instances":["mathematics","connector","console","developer","as_sega_genesis_3","computer_graphics","fourth_generation","software","media","emulator","video_gaming","video_game","video_game"],"pdf":["http://www.netinst.org/Clements_Ohashi.pdf","http://www.netinst.org/Clements_Ohashi.pdf"],"categories":["Products
