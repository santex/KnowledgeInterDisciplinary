(n.d.). The American HeritageÂ® Science Dictionary.\nRetrieved December 30, 2012, from Dictionary.com website:\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sociology \"The scientific study of human\nsocial behavior and its origins, development, organizations, and\ninstitutions.\" It is a social science which uses various methods of\nempirical investigation and critical\nanalysis to develop a body of knowledge about\nhuman social activity, structures, and functions. A goal for many sociologists\nis to conduct research which may be applied directly to social policy and\nwelfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding\nof social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro level of individual\nagency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social\nstructure.\n\nThe traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification, social\nclass, culture, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, and deviance. As\nall spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social\nstructure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to\nfurther subjects, such as health, medical, military and penal institutions, the\nInternet,political economyand the role of social activity in the development of\nscientific knowledge.\n\nThe range of social scientific methods has also expanded. Social researchers\ndraw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic\nand cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly\ninterpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches to the analysis of\nsociety. Conversely, recent decades have seen the rise of new analytically,\nmathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based\nmodelling and social network analysis. It also includes new areas like Development studies and\npolitical economy. http://www.asanet.org/sections/list.cfm Sociology\nshould not be confused with various general social studies courses which bear\nlittle relation to sociological theory or social science research methodology.\n","linknr":1792,"url":"Sociology","recorded":1362479223,"links":178,"instances":["cultural_theorist","social_science","sculpture","book","sociology","psychology","sociology","classification_of_human_beings","sociology","sociology","semiotics","sociology","personal_and_cultural","philosophy","statistics","sociology","philosophy","sociology"],"pdf":["http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2095839.pdf","http://www.willettsurvey.org/TMSTN/Gender/ComplementaryGenderSterotypes.pdf","http://www.willettsurvey.org/TMSTN/Gender/ComplementaryGenderSterotypes.pdf","http://newyorkfed.org/research/epr/98v04n1/9803hanu.pdf","http://willer.berkeley.edu/WillerOverdoingGender.pdf","http://nos.org/331courseE/L-3%20SOCIOLOGY%20ITS%20RELATIONSHIP%20WITH%20OTHER%20SOCIAL%20SCIEN.pdf","http://nos.org/331courseE/L-3%20SOCIOLOGY%20ITS%20RELATIONSHIP%20WITH%20OTHER%20SOCIAL%20SCIEN.pdf","http://nos.org/331courseE/L-3%20SOCIOLOGY%20ITS%20RELATIONSHIP%20WITH%20OTHER%20SOCIAL%20SCIEN.pdf","http://nos.org/331courseE/L-3%20SOCIOLOGY%20ITS%20RELATIONSHIP%20WITH%20OTHER%20SOCIAL%20SCIEN.pdf","http://ddl.uwinnipeg.ca/res_des/files/readings/cwmills-intel_craft.pdf"],"categories":["Social
