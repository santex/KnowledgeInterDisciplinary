{"cursor":"25697","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Health advocacy' encompasses direct service to the individual or family as well\nas activities that promote health and access to health care in communities and\nthe larger public. Advocates support and promote the rights of the patient in\nthe health care arena, help build capacity to improve community health and\nenhance health policy initiatives focused on available, safe and quality care.\nHealth Advocates are suited best to address challenge of patient-centered care\nin our complex healthcare system. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines patient-\ncentered care as: Health care that establishes a partnership among\npractitioners, patients, and their families (when appropriate) to ensure that\ndecisions respect patientsâ wants, needs, and preferences and that patients have\nthe education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their\nown care. Patient-centered care is also one of the overreaching goals\nof health advocacy, in addition to safer medical systems, and greater patient\ninvolvement in healthcare delivery and design. Jo Anne L. Earp, Elizabeth A.\nFrench, & Melissa B. Gilkey: Patient Advocacy for Health Care Quality.\n\nPatient representatives, ombudsmen, educators, care managers, patient navigators\nand health advisers are health advocates who work in direct patient care\nenvironments, including hospitals, community health centers, long term care\nfacilities or patient services programs of non-profit organizations. They\ncollaborate with other health care providers to mediate conflict and facilitate\npositive change, and as educators and health information specialists, advocates\nwork to empower others.\n\nIn the policy arenas health advocates work for positive change in the health\ncare system, improved access to quality care, protection and enhancement of\npatient's rights from positions in government agencies, disease-specific\nvoluntary associations, grassroots and national health policy organizations and\nthe media.\n\nThere may be a distinction between patient advocates, who work specifically with\nor on behalf of individual patients and families, or in disease-specific\nvoluntary associations, and health advocates, whose work is more focused on\ncommunities, policies or the system as a whole. Often, however, the terms\n\"patient advocate\" and \"health advocate\" are used interchangeably or depending\non immediate context.\n\nRapidly growing areas of health advocacy include advocates in clinical research\nsettings, particularly those focused on protecting the human subjects of medical\nresearch, advocates in the many disease-specific associations, particularly\nthose centered on genetic disorders or widespread chronic conditions, and\nadvocates who serve clients in private practice, alone or in larger companies.\n","linknr":220,"url":"health_advocacy","recorded":1371244372,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Institute_of_Medicine","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Patient-centered_care","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Geriatric_care_management","#History","#Professionalization","#Education_in_Health_Advocacy","#Certification_and_Licensing","#Health_Advocates_Association","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/National_Welfare_Rights_Organization","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Joint_Commission","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Our_Bodies,_Ourselves","#cite_note-5","/wiki/American_Hospital_Association","#cite_note-Rothman1997-6","/wiki/Roemer%27s_Law","#cite_note-Roemer1961-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-Starr1982-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/wiki/American_Cancer_Society","/wiki/March_of_Dimes","/wiki/Hull_House","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Lillian_Wald","#cite_note-14","/wiki/Maternity_Center_Association","#cite_note-15","/wiki/Community_organizing","/wiki/Love_Canal","/wiki/Gainesville,_Georgia","#cite_note-16","/wiki/West_Harlem_Environmental_Action","/wiki/Blue_Veins","/wiki/Precautionary_principle","/wiki/Breast_cancer_advocacy","#cite_note-17","#cite_note-aphadvocates-18","/w/index.php?title=Visiting_Nurse_Associations_of_America&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Sarah_Lawrence_College","#cite_note-Ravich1981-19","#cite_note-Starr1982-9","/wiki/Flexner_Report","/wiki/American_Medical_Association","#cite_note-20","#cite_note-21","#cite_note-22","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-23","/wiki/Sarah_Lawrence_College","/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison","#cite_note-24","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-26","#cite_note-27","/wiki/Legal_Services_Corporation#Programs","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-28","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Genetic_Alliance","#cite_note-29","#cite_note-aphadvocates-18","#cite_note-30","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Breast_cancer_advocacy","/wiki/Patient_advocacy","/w/index.php?title=Health_advocacy&action=edit&section=7","#cite_ref-1","http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10027","/wiki/Crossing_the_Quality_Chasm","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780309072809","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include","#cite_ref-3","http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1663","#cite_ref-4","http://www.jointcommission.org/JointCommission/Templates/GeneralInformation.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRNODEGUID=%7b7046B66B-DB60-4982-9323-52C09968F8AC%7d&NRORIGINALURL=%2fAboutUs%2fjoint_commission_history%2ehtm&NRCACHEHINT=Guest#1910","#cite_ref-5","http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/about/history.asp","#cite_ref-Rothman1997_6-0","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","#cite_ref-Roemer1961_7-0","#cite_ref-8","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","#cite_ref-Starr1982_9-0","#cite_ref-Starr1982_9-1","/wiki/Paul_Starr","/wiki/The_Social_Transformation_of_American_Medicine","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","#cite_ref-10","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","#cite_ref-11","#cite_ref-12","http://www.ssa.gov/history/childb1.html","#cite_ref-13","http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/KCL05001.html","#cite_ref-14","http://www.vnsny.org/mainsite/about/a_history.html","#cite_ref-15","http://www.childbirthconnection.org/article.asp?ck=10076&ClickedLink=0&area=3","#cite_ref-16","#cite_ref-17","http://www.rachel.org/?q=en/newsletters/rachels_news/","#cite_ref-aphadvocates_18-0","#cite_ref-aphadvocates_18-1","http://aphadvocates.org/index.asp","#cite_ref-Ravich1981_19-0","#cite_ref-20","http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/pkyonge/Rogers.htm","#cite_ref-21","#cite_ref-22","http://healthadvocateprograms.com","#cite_ref-23","http://healthadvocateprograms.com/masterlist.htm","#cite_ref-24","http://www.patientpartnerships.org/certificate/","#cite_ref-25","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/9780763749
