It typically occurs at the ends of long bones, proximal to joints and\nwithin the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly vascular and\nfrequently contains red bone marrow where hematopoiesis, the production of blood\ncells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is\nthe trabecula.\n\nIts Latin name is 'substantia spongiosa' or 'substantia spongiosa ossium'. The words cancellous and trabecular refer to the tiny lattice-\nshaped that form the tissue. It was first illustrated\naccurately in the engravings of CrisÃ³stomo Martinez. {{cite journal\n| quotes = yes\n|last=Gomez |first=Santiago |authorlink= |year=2002|month=Feb. |title=CrisÃ³stomo\nMartinez, 1638-1694: the discoverer of trabecular bone |journal=Endocrine\n|volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=3â4 |publisher= |location = United States| issn = 1355-\n008X| pmid = 12014701 |doi = 10.1385/ENDO:17:1:03\n| bibcode = | oclc =| id = | url = | language = | format = | accessdate = |\n| laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote =\n }}\n\nCancellous bone has a greater surface area in comparison with cortical bone, and\nas a consequence cancellous bone is ideal for metabolic activity e.g. exchange\nof calcium ions.\n\nIn osteoporosis (specifically Type 1, aka post-menopausal), cancellous bone is\nmore severely affected than cortical bone.\n","linknr":207,"url":"Trabecular_bone","recorded":1362510768,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Skeletal system"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Illu_compact_spongy_bone.jpg/350px-Illu_compact_spongy_bone.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Spongy_bone_-_trabecules.jpg/350px-Spongy_bone_-_trabecules.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Skeleton_woman_back.jpg/15px-Skeleton_woman_back.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Micrograph","Osseous_tissue","Cortical_bone","Surface_area","Vascular","Bone_marrow","Hematopoiesis","Trabecula","Latin","Crisóstomo_Martinez","United_States","Osteoporosis","Cortical_bone","Frank_H._Netter"]}
