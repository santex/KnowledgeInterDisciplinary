{"cursor":"4469","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Artificial development', also known as 'artificial embryogeny' or\n'computational development', is an area of computer science and engineering\nconcerned with computational models motivated by genotype-phenotype mappings in\nbiological systems. Artificial development is often considered a sub-field of\nevolutionary computation, although the principles of artificial development have\nalso been used within stand-alone computational models.\n\nWithin evolutionary computation, the need for artificial development techniques\nwas motivated by the perceived lack of scalability and evolvability of direct\nsolution encodings (Tufte, 2008). Artificial development is based around the\nidea of an indirect solution encoding. Rather than describing a solution\ndirectly, an indirect encoding describes (either explicitly or implicitly) the\nprocess by which a solution is constructed. Often, but not always, these\nindirect encodings are based upon biological principles of development such as\nmorphogen gradients, cell division and cellular differentiation (e.g. Doursat\n2008), gene regulatory networks (e.g. Guo et al., 2009), degeneracy (Whitacre et\nal., 2010), grammatical evolution (de Salabert et al., 2006), or analogous\ncomputational processes such as re-writing, iteration, and time. The influences\nof interaction with the environment, spatiality and physical constraints on\ndifferentiated multi-cellular development have been investigated more recently\n(e.g. Knabe et al. 2008).\n\nArtificial development approaches have been applied to a number of computational\nand design problems, including electronic circuit design (Miller and Banzhaf\n2003), robotic controllers (e.g. Taylor 2004), and the design of physical\nstructures (e.g. Hornby 2004).\n","linknr":86,"url":"Artificial_development","recorded":1362478799,"links":14,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.ece.stevens-tech.edu/~ymeng/publications/BioSystems09_Meng.pdf","http://philipprohlfshagen.net/resources/WhitacreRole.pdf","http://www.tim-taylor.com/papers/taylor_grn.pdf","http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262287196chap42.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary algorithms"],"headings":["Notes"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["degeneracy","biology"]],"members":["degeneracy"],"related":["Computer_science","Engineering","Evolutionary_computation","Morphogen","Cell_division","Cellular_differentiation","Gene_regulatory_networks","Degeneracy_(biology)","Grammatical_evolution"]}
