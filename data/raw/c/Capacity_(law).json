Capacity is an aspect of status and both are defined by a person's\npersonal law: *for natural persons, the law of domicile or [[lex domicilii]] in\ncommon law jurisdictions, and either the law of nationality or [[lex patriae]],\nor of habitual residence in civil law states; *for legal persons, the law of the\nplace of incorporation, the [[lex incorporationis]] for companies while other\nforms of business entity derive their capacity either from the law of the place\nin which they were formed or the laws of the states in which they establish a\npresence for trading purposes depending on the nature of the entity and the\ntransactions entered into. When the law limits or bars a person from engaging in\nspecified activities, any agreements or contracts to do so are either voidable\nor void for 'incapacity'. Sometimes such legal incapacity is referred to as\nincompetence. For comparison, see Competence (law).\n","linknr":319,"url":"Capacity_(law)","recorded":1362665111,"links":35,"instances":["law","law","law","law","conflict","legal_system","area","business","law","law","law","law","law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Conflict of laws","Contract law","Rights","Legal doctrines and principles"],"headings":["Discussion","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gift","law"],["will","law"],["status","law"],["domicile","law"],["jurisdiction","area"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["incorporation","business"],["company","law"],["competence","law"],["public_policy","law"],["evasion","law"],["nullity","conflict"],["minor","law"],["jurisdiction","area"],["minor","law"],["administrator","law"]],"members":["evasion","competence","status","minor","nullity","civil_law","jurisdiction","incorporation","administrator","public_policy","gift","will","company","domicile"],"related":["Natural_person","Legal_person","Right","Duty","Obligation","Marriage","Mergers_and_acquisitions","Contract","Gift_(law)","Will_(law)","Status_(law)","Domicile_(law)","Common_law","Jurisdiction_(area)","Nationality","Habitual_residence","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Incorporation_(business)","Company_(law)","Law","Contract","Contract","Competence_(law)","Social_contract","Citizen","Public_policy_(law)","Parens_patriae","Consanguinity","Evasion_(law)","Nullity_(conflict)","Freedom_of_contract","Human_rights","Civil_rights","Right_to_vote","English_law","Minor_(law)","Culture","Prejudice","Age_of_majority","Marriageable_age","Voting_age","Jurisdiction_(area)","Contract","Medical_procedure","Consent","Legal_guardian","United_States","Alcohol","State_law","Emancipation_of_minors","Age_of_criminal_responsibility","Age_of_consent","Adult","British_Columbia","Minor_(law)","Barter","Retail","Legal_fiction","Insanity","Mental_disorder","Power_of_attorney","Legal_guardian","Court_of_protection","Mental_Capacity_Act_2005","Lasting_power_of_attorney","Coma","Paralysis","Stroke","Disability","Huntington's_disease","Alzheimer's_disease","Lewy_body","Trust_law","Probate_court","Criminal_Law","M'Naghten_Rules","Excuse","Insanity_defense","Mental_disorder_defense","Bankruptcy","United_States","U.S._State","Corporations","Constitutional_documents","General_partnership","Limited_partnership","Unions","Trade_union","Insolvency","Administrator_(law)","Capacity_in_English_law"]}
