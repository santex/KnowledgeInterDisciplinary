A typical\nmodern match is made of a small wooden stick or stiff paper. One end is coated\nwith a material that can be ignited by frictional heat generated by striking the\nmatch against a suitable surface. Matches are usually\nsold in quantity; wooden ones are packaged in boxes, and paper matches are\nclustered in rows stapled into matchbooks. They are commonly sold by\ntobacconists and many other kinds of shops. The coated end of a match, known as\nthe match \"head,\" contains either phosphorus or phosphorus sesquisulfide as the\nactive ingredient and gelatin as a binder. There are two main types of matches:\n'safety matches', which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface,\nand 'strike-anywhere matches', for which any suitably frictional surface can be\nused. Some match-like compositions, known as electric matches, are ignited\nelectrically and do not make use of heat from friction.\n","linknr":594,"url":"match","recorded":1362581496,"links":109,"instances":["shipboard","explosives","inventor"],"pdf":["http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/8636/1/IJCT%2012(3)%20369-380.pdf","http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/8636/1/IJCT%2012(3)%20369-380.pdf","http://www.jce.divched.org/journal/Issues/1941/Sep/jceSubscriber/JCE1941p0428.pdf","http://www.jce.divched.org/journal/Issues/1941/Sep/jceSubscriber/JCE1941p0428.pdf","http://www.jce.divched.org/journal/Issues/1944/Nov/jceSubscriber/JCE1944p0522.pdf","http://www.jce.divched.org/journal/Issues/1944/Nov/jceSubscriber/JCE1944p0522.pdf","http://www.jce.divched.org/Journal/issues/1941/Jul/jceSubscriber/JCE1941p0316.pdf","http://www.jce.divched.org/Journal/issues/1941/Jul/jceSubscriber/JCE1941p0316.pdf"],"categories":["Firelighting","Hungarian
