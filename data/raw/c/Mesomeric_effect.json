The effect is used in\na qualitative way and describes the electron withdrawing or releasing properties\nof substituents based on relevant resonance structures and is symbolized by the\nletter 'M'. The mesomeric effect is negative ('-M') when the substituent is an\nelectron-withdrawing group and the effect is positive ('+M') when based on\nresonance and the substituent is an electron releasing group.\n\n*Examples of -M substituents: acetyl (IUPAC ethanoyl) - nitrile - nitro\n*Examples of +M substituents: alcohol - amine-benzene\n\nThe net electron flow from or to the substituent is determined also by the\ninductive effect. The mesomeric effect as a result of p-orbital overlap\n(resonance) has absolutely no effect on this inductive effect, as the inductive\neffect is purely to do with the electronegativity of the atoms and their\ntopology in the molecule (which atoms are connected to which).\n\nThe concepts of mesomeric effect, 'mesomerism' and 'mesomer' were introduced by\nIngold in 1938 as an alternative to the Pauling's synonymous concept of\nresonance.
