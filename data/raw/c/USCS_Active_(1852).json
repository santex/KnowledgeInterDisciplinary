Intended for California service, she was built\nas Gold Hunter by Jacob Aaron Westervelt in New York in 1849. The Coast Survey\npurchased her on the United States West Coast in 1852 and renamed her Active.\nLieutenant James Alden, Jr., was her commanding officer for most of her time in\nactive Coast Survey service.\n\nActive served on the U.S. West Coast. She conducted the Coast Surveys\nfirst reconnaissance from San Francisco, California, to San Diego,\nCalifornia, in 1852.\n\nActive sometimes stepped outside of her normal Coast Survey duties to support\nU.S. military operations, serving as a troop transport and dispatch boat during\nvarious wars with Native Americans and during the San Juan Islands \"Pig War\"\nwith the United Kingdom in 1859. She also rushed Union troops to Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, in 1861 during the early stages of the American Civil War.\n\nActive was taken out of Coast Survey service in 1861 and sold in 1862.\n","linknr":103,"url":"USCS_Active_(1852)","recorded":1362477134,"links":12,"instances":["ship","american_civil_war"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ships of the United States Coast Survey","Survey ships of the United States","American Civil War ships","1849 ships"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/USC%26GS_Active_%281852%29.jpg/300px-USC%26GS_Active_%281852%29.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/US_flag_31_stars.svg/67px-US_flag_31_stars.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transport","ship"],["union","american_civil_war"]],"members":["transport","union"],"related":["Jacob_Aaron_Westervelt","New_York_City","Survey_ship","Survey_ship","United_States_Coast_Survey","United_States_Coast_and_Geodetic_Survey","Sidewheel","Steamboat","Jacob_Aaron_Westervelt","United_States_West_Coast","Lieutenant","James_Alden,_Jr.","Reconnaissance","San_Francisco,_California","California","San_Diego,_California","United_States","Transport_(ship)","Dispatch_boat","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","San_Juan_Islands","Pig_War","United_Kingdom","Union_(American_Civil_War)","Los_Angeles,_California","American_Civil_War"]}
