{"cursor":"8978","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn genetics, a 'recessive gene' is an allele that causes a phenotype (visible or\ndetectable characteristic) that is only seen in a homozygous genotype (an\norganism that has two copies of the same allele) and never in a heterozygous\ngenotype. Every person has two copies of every gene on autosomal chromosomes,\none from mother and one from father. If a genetic trait is recessive, a person\nneeds to inherit two copies of the gene for the trait to be expressed. Thus,\nboth parents have to be carriers of a recessive trait in order for a child to\nexpress that trait. Note that \"expression\" in this sense does not refer to\n''genetic'' expression (i.e., transcription and translation) of the gene.\nInstead, \"expression\" here refers to the observance of the gene within the\nphenotype. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance with each child\nto show the recessive trait in the phenotype. Thus if the parents are closely\nrelated (in-breeding) the probability of both having inherited the same gene is\nincreased and as a result the probability of the children showing the recessive\ntrait is increased as well.\n\nThe term \"recessive gene\" is part of the laws of Mendelian inheritance created\nby Gregor Mendel. Examples of recessive genes in Mendel's famous pea plant\nexperiments include those that determine the color and shape of seed pods, and\nplant height.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Recessive","recorded":1362374020,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical genetics"],"headings":["Allosomal recessive gene","Autosomal recessive gene","Nomenclature","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Autorecessive.svg/220px-Autorecessive.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/8/a38aae381445de2daf0619604857fde4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Genetics","Allele","Phenotype","Homozygous","Genotype","Genotype","Autosomal","Gene_expression","Mendelian_inheritance","Gregor_Mendel","Allosome","Hemophilia","Inheritance","Autosome","Chromosome","Autosomal_dominant","Homozygous","Hardy-Weinberg_principle","Genetic_disorder","Allele","Embryo","Heterozygous","Autosomal_dominant","Homozygous","Gene","DNA","Molecular_biology","Punnett_square","Heterozygous","Gregor_Mendel","Sickle_cell_anemia","Glutamic_acid","Valine","Co-dominant","Cystic_fibrosis","PKAN","Neurodegeneration_with_brain_iron_accumulation","Tay-Sachs_disease","Chronic_granulomatous_disease","Thalassemia","Bloom's_Syndrome","Alpha_1-antitrypsin_deficiency","Haemochromatosis","Wilson's_disease","Mucopolysaccharidosis","Glycogen_storage_disease","Homocystinuria","Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia","Dubin-Johnson_syndrome","Fanconi_anemia","Galactosemia","Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency","Phenylketonuria","Albinism","Rotor_syndrome","Familial_Mediterranean_fever","Pendred_syndrome","Spinal_muscular_atrophy","Xeroderma_pigmentosum","Friedrich's_ataxia","Dominant_gene","Incomplete_dominance","Dominance_relationship","X-linked","Mitochondrial_DNA"]}
