{"cursor":"18666","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Military intelligence' is a military discipline that exploits a number of\ninformation collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction\nto commanders in support of their decisions. This is achieved by providing an\nassessment of available data from a wide range of sources, directed towards the\ncommanders' mission requirements or responding to focused questions as part of\nthe operational or campaign planning activity. In order to provide an informed\nanalysis, the commander's information requirements are first identified. These\ninformation requirements are then incorporated into a process of intelligence\ncollection, analysis and dissemination.\n\nAreas of study may include the operational environment, hostile, friendly and\nneutral forces, the civilian population in an area of combat operations, and\nother, broader areas of interest.\n\n Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels, from tactical\nto strategic, in peacetime, the period of transition to war, and during a\nwar itself.\n\nMost governments maintain a military intelligence capability to provide\nanalytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and\nfrom other arms and services. The military intelligence capabilities will\ninteract with civilian intelligence capabilities to inform the spectrum of\npolitical and military activities.\n\nPersonnel selected for intelligence duties may be selected for their analytical\nabilities and personal intelligence before receiving formal training.\n","linknr":749,"url":"Military_intelligence","recorded":1362902178,"links":43,"instances":["docex","information_gathering"],"pdf":["http://www.ni-u.edu/pdf/NIU_Catalog_2011.pdf","http://www.ni-u.edu/pdf/NIU_Catalog_2011.pdf"],"categories":["Military intelligence|","Types of espionage","Intelligence (information gathering)","Combat support occupations"],"headings":["Levels of intelligence","Intelligence tasking","The intelligence process","See also","External links","Footnotes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Ie_defence_positions.png/300px-Ie_defence_positions.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/CSI_timeline.png/280px-CSI_timeline.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intelligence","information_gathering"],["document_exploitation","docex"]],"members":["document_exploitation","intelligence"],"related":["List_of_intelligence_gathering_disciplines","Commanders","Decision_making_process","Intelligence_analysis","War","Government","Strategic_intelligence","Non-state_actor","Tactical_Intelligence","Sociological_intelligence","Geography","Demographics","Order_of_battle","ECHELON","Need-to-know","Daniel_Ellsberg","Battlespace","Aesopian_language","Cryptography","Company_Level_Intelligence_Cell","Counter-intelligence","Disinformation","Edmund_Charaszkiewicz","Electronic_warfare","Espionage","Intelligence_cycle","Intelligence_(information_gathering)","Intelligence_gathering_network","Intelligence,_Surveillance,_Target_Acquisition,_and_Reconnaissance","Interrogation","Medical_intelligence","Meteorological_intelligence","Military_secret","Reconnaissance","Scenario_planning","Spy_satellite","Strategic_intelligence","Technical_intelligence","Admiralty_code","Cultural_intelligence","Defence_Intelligence_Organisation","GRU","Inter-Services_Intelligence","Military_Intelligence_of_Pakistan","Milit√§rischer_Abschirmdienst","CSIS","Defense_Intelligence_Agency","Defense_Language_Institute","Document_Exploitation_(DOCEX)","United_States_Army_Intelligence_Center","World_Basic_Information_Library","Julius_Caesar","Cassius_Dio","Francis_Dvornik","J.F.C._Fuller","John_Keegan","Barbara_W._Tuchman","Texas_State_University"]}
