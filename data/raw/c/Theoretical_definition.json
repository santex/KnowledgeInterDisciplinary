This type of\n definition assumes both knowledge and acceptance of the theories that it\n depends on. [http://atheism.about.com/od/logicalarguments/a/d-\n ef_theoretical.htm About.com, Logical Arguments, \"Theoretical\n Definitions\"] To theoretically define is to create a hypothetical\n construct. This method of operationalization is not to be confused with\n operationally defining. An example of a theoretical definition is that of\n \"Heat\" in physics, which actually puts forth an entire theory of heat\n (involving accelerating molecules, etc.). A Concise\n Introduction to Logic by Patrick J. Hurley. 2007. Cengage learning. Entry on\n \"Theoretical Definitions\" may even be available through google books\n\nTheoretical definitions are common in both philosophy and science, and can be difficult to understand because of their strict,\nand often conceptual uses. The goal is to eliminate vagueness (e.g. how many\nmetres exactly is a \"tall\" person?) and ambiguity (e.g. \"I purchased a bat\"\ncould have many meanings). Theoretical definitions specify exactly when the word\nshould and should not be applied. In this regard they are unlike persuasive\ndefinitions, which can be both vague and ambiguous. Theoretical definitions do,\nhowever, have one thing in common with persuasive definitions: they are\nnormative, and not merely descriptive. To create a theoretical definition is to\npropose a way of thinking about an issue. Indeed, theoretical definitions contain built-in theories;\nthey cannot be simply reduced to describing a set of observations. The\ndefinition will contain implicit inductions and deductive consequences that are\npart of the theory it pushes. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-theory-\nobservation/#OpeObsRep  The word \"Heat\" in physics is not simply\ndescribing molecules, it is proposing various laws of nature and predicting\ncertain results.\n\nLike Stipulative definitions, it is not a valid criticism to say that a\ntheoretical definition is \"wrong about how most people use the word\" nor that\n\"the definition itself is false\". Instead one might say that a theoretical\ndefinition is unhelpful. This is unlike lexical definitions, which themselves\nclaim to be common, popular uses of a word. In contrast, a theoretical definition is only a bad one if\nthe theories that it supports are invalidated or falsified (which occurs through\nconflict with other theories that have been accepted). It is at that point -\nonce they describe falsified theories - that these kinds of definitions become\nunhelpful or 'unpromising' (e.g. the theoretical definition of \"demonic\npossession\" is not itself false, the ideas are, and so the term is useless to\nmodern medicine). It is in this way that professional fields build frameworks of\nagreed-upon theoretical definitions. A case in point, consider \"Heat\". If a\nphysicist's theories of molecules turn out to be wrong in some sense, this would\nmake \"Heat\" an unhelpful theoretical definition, not a false one (i.e. this kind\nof definition only invites us to use certain theories, and the theories make the\ntruth claims). Moreover, like the theories that build\nthem, theoretical definitions change as scientific understanding grows.\n\nPsychology has many examples of ideas that required conceptual definitions,\nincluding intelligence, knowledge, tolerance, and preference. Following the\nestablishment of a theoretical definition, the researcher must use an\noperational definition to indicate how the abstract concept will be measured.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Theoretical_definition","recorded":1362568895,"links":13,"instances":["unit"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Definition","Logic","Metatheory"],"headings":["Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Gandhi_thinking_mood_1931.jpg/160px-Gandhi_thinking_mood_1931.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Obesity-waist_circumference.PNG/140px-Obesity-waist_circumference.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["newton","unit"]],"members":["newton"],"related":["Definition","Hypothetical_construct","Operationalization","Operational_definition","Heat","Molecules","Vagueness","Ambiguity","Persuasive_definitions","Inductive_reasoning","Deductive","Stipulative_definitions","Lexical_definitions","Theories","Falsified","Psychology","Intelligence","Operational_definition","Operational_definition","Newton_(unit)","Spring_scale","Color","Wavelength","Philosophy","Social_sciences","Metre","Postulate","Special_relativity","Speed_of_light","John_Searle","Chinese_room","Thought_experiment","Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence","Operational_definition","Turing_test","Overweight","National_Institutes_of_Health","Body_mass_index","General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures","International_Committee_for_Weights_and_Measures"]}
