The\nconcept can be summarized as that all parts of a system interact with and rely\non one another simply by the fact that they occupy the same system, and that a\nsystem is difficult or sometimes impossible to analyze through its individual\nparts considered alone. The concept is closely linked to the observer effect and\nthe butterfly effect. It is often linked to the concepts\nof interconnectedness which is used to refer to the spiritual, and\ninterdependence which refers to the moral, rather than physical or scientific.\n","linknr":92,"url":"Interconnectivity","recorded":1362476891,"links":10,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophy of science","Chaos theory"],"headings":["Examples","Differentiation from the butterfly effect","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["observer_effect","physics"]],"members":["observer_effect"],"related":["Cybernetics","Biology","Ecology","Network_theory","Non-linear_dynamics","Interaction","Observer_effect_(physics)","Butterfly_effect","Interconnectedness","Interdependence","Homeostasis","Fire","Grass"]}
