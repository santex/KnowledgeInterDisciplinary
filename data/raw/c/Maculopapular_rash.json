{"cursor":"2198","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'maculopapular rash' is a type of rash characterized by a flat, red area on\nthe skin that is covered with small confluent bumps. The term \"maculopapular\" is\na compound: [[macule]]s are small, flat discolored spots on the surface of the\nskin; and [[papule]]s are small, raised bumps. It is also described as\nerythematous, 'or red.'\n\nThis type of rash is common in several diseases and medical conditions,\nincluding scarlet fever, measles, rubella, secondary syphilis, erythrovirus\n(parvovirus B19), and heat rash. It is also a common manifestation of a skin\nreaction to the antibiotic amoxicillin or chemotherapy drugs.

Maculopapular rash is seen in graft-versus-\nhost disease (GVHD) developed after a blood transfusion, which can be seen\nwithin one week or several weeks after the blood transfusion. In the case of\nGVHD, the maculopapular rash may progress to a condition similar to toxic\nepidermal necrolysis.

It is also seen in patients with Marburg hemorrhagic fever, a\nfilovirus not unlike Ebola.\n\nThis type of rash can be as a result of large doses of niacin or no-flush niacin\n(2000 â 2500 mg), used for the management of low HDL cholesterol.\n","linknr":120,"url":"Maculopapular_rash","recorded":1362581278,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical terminology","Dermatologic terminology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Gray944.png/48px-Gray944.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Rash","Erythematous","Scarlet_fever","Measles","Rubella","Syphilis","Erythrovirus","Heat_rash","Amoxicillin","Chemotherapy","Leukemic","Graft-versus-host_disease","Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis","Ebola","Marburg_hemorrhagic_fever","Filovirus","Niacin","List_of_cutaneous_conditions"]}
