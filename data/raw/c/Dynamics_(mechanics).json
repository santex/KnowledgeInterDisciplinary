In\naddition, Isaac Newton established the undergirding physical laws which govern\ndynamics in physics. By studying his system of mechanics, dynamics can be\nunderstood. In particular, dynamics is mostly related to Newton's second law of\nmotion. However, all three laws of motion are taken into consideration, because\nthese are interrelated in any given observation or experiment. {{Cite web| last =Goc| first =Roman| title =Dynamics| date =2004-2005\ncopyright date\n  | url =http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~romangoc/M3-dynamics.html| format =Physics\n  | tutorial accessdate =2010-02-18}}\n\nThe study of dynamics falls under two categories: linear and rotational. Linear\ndynamics pertains to objects moving in a line and involves such quantities as\nforce, mass/inertia, displacement (in units of distance), velocity (distance\nper unit time), acceleration (distance per unit of time squared) and momentum\n(mass times unit of velocity). Rotational dynamics pertains to objects that are\nrotating or moving in a curved path and involves such quantities as torque,\nmoment of inertia/rotational inertia, angular displacement (in radians or less\noften, degrees), angular velocity (radians per unit time), angular acceleration\n(radians per unit of time squared) and angular momentum (moment of interia\ntimes unit of angular velocity). Very often, objects exhibit linear and\nrotational motion.\n\nFor classical electromagnetism, it is Maxwell's equations that describe the\ndynamics. And the dynamics of classical systems involving both mechanics and\nelectromagnetism are described by the combination of Newton's laws, Maxwell's\nequations, and the Lorentz force.\n","linknr":297,"url":"Dynamics_(mechanics)","recorded":1362537920,"links":73,"instances":["physics","mechanics","vector"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dynamics|"],"headings":["Force","Newton's laws","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["branch","academia#physics"],["displacement","vector"],["deformation","mechanics"],["motion","physics"]],"members":["motion","branch","deformation","displacement"],"related":["Physics","Classical_mechanics","Force","Torque","Motion","Isaac_Newton","Physical_laws","Second_law_of_motion","Force","Mass","Displacement_(vector)","Velocity","Acceleration","Momentum","Torque","Moment_of_inertia","Rotational_inertia","Angular_displacement","Angular_velocity","Angular_acceleration","Angular_momentum","Electromagnetism","Maxwell's_equations","Lorentz_force","Pressure","Free_body","Velocity","Deformation_(mechanics)","Motion_(physics)","Acceleration","Mass","Multibody_dynamics","Rigid_body_dynamics","Analytical_dynamics"]}
