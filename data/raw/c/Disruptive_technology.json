The\nterm is used in business and technology literature to describe innovations that\nimprove a product or service in ways that the market does not expect, typically\nfirst by designing for a different set of consumers in the new market and later\nby lowering prices in the existing market.\n\nIn contrast to disruptive innovation, a 'sustaining innovation' does not create\nnew markets or value networks but rather only evolves existing ones with better\nvalue, allowing the firms within to compete against each other's sustaining\nimprovements. Sustaining innovations may be either \"discontinuous\" (i.e. \"transformational\" or \"revolutionary\") or\n\"continuous\" (i.e. \"evolutionary\").\n\nThe term \"'disruptive technology'\" has been widely used as a synonym of\n\"disruptive innovation\", but the latter is now preferred, because market\ndisruption has been found to be a function usually not of technology itself but\nrather of its changing application. Sustaining innovations are typically\ninnovations in technology, whereas disruptive innovations change entire\nmarkets. For example, the automobile was a revolutionary technological\ninnovation, but it was not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles\nwere expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn\nvehicles. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the\ndebut of the lower priced Ford Model T in 1908. The mass-produced automobile\nwas a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market. The\nautomobile, by itself, was not.\n\nThe current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from\nwhat might be expected by default, an idea that Clayton M. Christensen called\nthe \"technology mudslide hypothesis\". This is the simplistic idea that an\nestablished firm fails because it doesn't \"keep up technologically\" with other\nfirms. In this hypothesis, firms are like climbers scrambling upward on\ncrumbling footing, where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay\nstill, and any break from the effort (such as complacency born of profitability)\ncauses a rapid downhill slide. Christensen and colleagues have shown that this\nsimplistic hypothesis is wrong; it doesn't model reality. What they have shown\nis that good firms are usually aware of the innovations, but their business\nenvironment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise, because\nthey are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take\nscarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations (which are needed to\ncompete against current competition). In Christensen's terms, a firm's existing\nvalue networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow\nits pursuit by that firm. Meanwhile, start-up firms inhabit different value\nnetworks, at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to\ninvade the older value network. At that time, the established firm in that\nnetwork can at best only fend off the market share attack with a me-too entry,\nfor which survival (not thriving) is the only reward. .\n\nThe work of Christensen and others during the 2000s has addressed the question\nof what firms can do to avoid oblivion brought on by technological disruption.\n","linknr":590,"url":"Disruptive_technology","recorded":1362483622,"links":38,"instances":["music","economics","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.christiansandstrom.org/content/PhDchristiansandstrom.pdf","http://www.christiansandstrom.org/content/PhDchristiansandstrom.pdf","http://tourism.wu-wien.ac.at/lehrv/lven/05ws/lv4/danneels_disruptive.pdf","http://tourism.wu-wien.ac.at/lehrv/lven/05ws/lv4/danneels_disruptive.pdf","http://www.modelbenders.com/papers/DisruptivePotential_RTM.pdf"],"categories":["Marketing","Product management","Technology by type","Innovation"],"headings":["History and usage of the term","The theory","Examples of disruptive innovations","Business implications","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Disruptivetechnology.gif/450px-Disruptivetechnology.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wikiversity-logo.svg/40px-Wikiversity-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["value","economics"],["competition","economics"],["single","music"]],"members":["single","competition","value"],"related":["Fuel_injection","Automobile","Ford_Model_T","Innovation","Market","Value_network","Value_(economics)","Competition_(economics)","Horse-drawn_vehicle","Ford_Model_T","Clayton_M._Christensen","Market_share","Clayton_M._Christensen","Hydraulic_machinery","Innovation","Disruption","Linux","Operating_system","Unix","Windows_NT","Supercomputer","Minicomputer","Desktop_computer","Bernoulli_Box","Zip_drive","Compact_Disc","USB_flash_drive","Bernoulli_drive","Zip_drive","Pocket_Calculator","Digital_media","Compact_Disc","DVD","Music_industry","Single_(music)","Peer-to-peer_file_sharing","ITunes_Store","Amazon.com","Cloud_computing","USB_flash_drive","Digital_media","Compact_Disc","DVD","Cloud_computing","Hydraulics","Excavator","Cable","Vertical_integration","Steel_mill","Minicomputer","Mainframe_computer","Personal_computers","Personal_computer","Minicomputer","Workstation","Word_processor","Lisp_machines","Desktop_publishing","Publishing","Economies_of_scale","Computer_printer","Offset_printing","Overhead_cost","Unit_cost","Laser_printer","Digital_photography","Shutter_lag","Digital_video","Film_stock","High_speed_photography","CMOS","Video_sensor_technology","Photographic_film","Steamboat","Sailing_ship","Telephones","Telegraphy","Western_Union","Alexander_Graham_Bell","Automobile","Rail_transport","Streetcars","Suburb","Ton-kilometer","Private_jet","Supersonic_transport","Concorde","Airline_hub","Sonic_boom","Plastic","Bakelite","Light-emitting_diode","Light_bulb","Indicator_light","Indoor_lighting","Street_lights","Phase-out_of_incandescent_light_bulbs","Digital_synthesizer","Electronic_organ","Piano","Liquid_crystal_display","Cathode_ray_tube","Digital_calculator","Mechanical_calculator","Facit_AB","Ultrasound","Radiography","Wikipedia","Encarta","Automotive_restoration","Radial_tire","Creative_destruction","Leapfrogging","List_of_emerging_technologies","Obsolescence","Paradigm_shift","Technology_strategy","Killer_application","Kenagy,_John","Donald_Norman"]}
