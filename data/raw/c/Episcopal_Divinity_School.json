The Episcopal Divinity School is\na member of the Boston Theological Institute, a consortium of nine Boston-area\nseminaries and divinity schools that share library and academic resources and\nallow cross-registration for courses. Since 2010, it shares part of its campus\nwith Lesley University and also offers cross-registration and pools resources\nwith that school.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Episcopal_Divinity_School","recorded":1362535218,"links":17,"instances":["united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Episcopal Church (United States)","Anglican seminaries and theological colleges","Seminaries and theological colleges in Massachusetts","Universities and colleges in Massachusetts","Educational institutions established in 1974","Universities and colleges in Cambridge, Massachusetts","Episcopal Church in Massachusetts","Episcopal Divinity School|*","Harvard Square"],"headings":["Founding","Churchmanship","Social Issues","Theological Perspectives","Notable people","Resources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Eds_logo.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/1879DrakeEpiscopal.jpg/300px-1879DrakeEpiscopal.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["episcopal_church","united_states"],["episcopal_church","united_states"]],"members":["episcopal_church"],"related":["Private_university","Seminary","Katherine_Hancock_Ragsdale","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","United_States","Episcopal_Church_(United_States)","Urban_area","Episcopal_Church_(United_States)","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Anglican_Communion","Metropolitan_Community_Church","Polity","Master_of_Divinity","Master_of_Arts_in_Theological_Studies","Doctor_of_Ministry","Harvard_Divinity_School","Boston_Theological_Institute","Lesley_University","Unitarianism","High_church","Low_church","Broad_church","Deacon","Carter_Heyward","Selma_to_Montgomery_marches","Jonathan_Myrick_Daniels","Hayneville,_Alabama","Ruby_Sales","Martyr"]}
