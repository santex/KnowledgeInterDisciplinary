{"cursor":"6893","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" is acetylated to form aspirin]] 'Acetylation' (or in IUPAC nomenclature\n 'ethanoylation') describes a reaction that introduces an acetyl functional\n group into a chemical compound. ('Deacetylation' is the removal of the\n acetyl group.)\n\nSpecifically, acetylation refers to that process of introducing an acetyl group\n(resulting in an acetoxy group) into a compound, namely, the substitution of an\nacetyl group for an active hydrogen atom. A reaction involving the replacement\nof the hydrogen atom of a hydroxyl group with an acetyl group (CH 3\nCO) yields a specific ester, the acetate. Acetic anhydride is commonly used as\nan acetylating agent reacting with free hydroxyl groups. For example, it is used\nin the synthesis of aspirin and heroin.\n","linknr":306,"url":"Acetylation","recorded":1362481182,"links":33,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.biolcellusa.org/boc/065/0109/boc0650109.pdf","http://www.biolcellusa.org/boc/065/0109/boc0650109.pdf"],"categories":["Organic reactions","Proteins","Posttranslational modification"],"headings":["Acetylation of proteins","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Aspirin_synthesis.png/300px-Aspirin_synthesis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Aspirin","IUPAC_nomenclature","Acetyl","Functional_group","Chemical_compound","Acetoxy_group","Hydrogen","Hydroxyl","Ester","Acetate","Acetic_anhydride","Aspirin","Heroin","Cell_(biology)","Post-translational_modification","Protein","Histone","P53","Tubulin","Lysine","Acetyl-CoA","Histone_acetylation_and_deacetylation","Gene_regulation","Enzyme","Protein_kinase","Phosphatases","Tubulin","Axoneme","Acetoxy_group","Acylation","Amide","Compendium_of_protein_lysine_acetylation","Ester","Organic_synthesis"]}
