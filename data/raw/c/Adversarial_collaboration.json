Nothing will happen if either side decides that it is\nbetter off when there is less scientific clarity. For this reason, failures to\nbroker adversarial collaborations are profoundly informative: they signal to the\npolicy world that the American racism debate and the sub-debate on unconscious\nprejudice may be politicized beyond scientific redemption. Tetlock (2006) has\noffered rough sociology-of-science diagnostics for judging the odds of failures\nof this sort. Adversarial collaboration is most feasible when least needed: when\nthe clashing camps have advanced testable theories, subscribe to common canons\nfor testing those theories, and disagreements are robust but respectful. And\nadversarial collaboration is least feasible when most needed: when the\nscientific community lacks clear criteria for falsifying points of view,\ndisagrees on key methodological issues, relies on second- or third-best\nsubstitute methods for testing causality, and is fractured into opposing camps\nthat engage in ad hominem posturing and that have intimate ties to political\nactors who see any concession as weakness. Tetlock (2006) calls the former\ncommunity as âepistemic Heaven.â the latter âepistemic hell,â and maintainsâin\nthe spirit of Figure 4âthat if adversarial collaboration is indeed unnecessary\nin heaven and impossible in hell, we should expect the greatest expected returns\nin the âmurky middleâ in which theory-testing conditions are less than ideal but\nnot yet hopeless.| Tetlock, Philip & Gregory Mitchell. 2009. \"Implicit Bias\nand Accountability Systems: What Must Organizations Do to Prevent\nDiscrimination?\" Research in Organizational Behavior 29:3-38.
