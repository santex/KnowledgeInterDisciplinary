{"cursor":"17240","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", pictured in a medicinal handbook: [[Franz Eugen KÃ¶hler]],KÃ¶hler's Medizinal-\nPflanzen'' (1887)]]\n\n\n'Gum arabic', also known as 'acacia gum', 'chaar gund', 'char goond', or\n'meska', is a natural gum made of hardened sap taken from two species of the\nacacia tree; [[Acacia senegal]] and [[Acacia seyal]]. The gum is harvested\ncommercially from wild trees throughout the Sahel from Senegal and Sudan to\nSomalia, although it has been historically cultivated in Arabia and West Asia.\n\nGum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. It was\nhistorically the source of the sugars arabinose and ribose, both of which were\nfirst discovered and isolated from it, and are named after it.\n\nGum arabic is used primarily in the food industry as a stabilizer. It is edible\nand has E number E414. Gum arabic is a key ingredient in traditional\nlithography and is used in printing, paint production, glue, cosmetics and\nvarious industrial applications, including viscosity control in inks and in\ntextile industries, although less expensive materials compete with it for many\nof these roles.\n\nWhile gum arabic is now produced mostly throughout the African Sahel, it is\nstill harvested and used in the Middle East. For example, Arab populations use\nthe natural gum to make a chilled, sweetened, and flavored gelato-like dessert.\n","linknr":354,"url":"Gum_arabic","recorded":1362373039,"links":45,"instances":["material","visual_arts","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRMDTF/Resources/Gum_Arabic_Policy_Note.pdf"],"categories":["Agricultural products of Africa","Food ingredients","Crops","Natural gums","Agriculture in Sudan","Agriculture in Niger","Agriculture in Chad","Agriculture in Mauritania","Agriculture in Senegal","Agriculture in Nigeria","Excipients"],"headings":["Usage","Physical properties","Production","Market Information","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Acacia_senegal_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-004.jpg/220px-Acacia_senegal_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-004.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Gomma_arabica.png/220px-Gomma_arabica.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Gum-arabic.png/220px-Gum-arabic.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Gouache.jpg/220px-Gouache.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Acacia_senegal_Taub68.png/220px-Acacia_senegal_Taub68.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Acacia_seyal_Taub66.png/220px-Acacia_seyal_Taub66.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/GommeBakel.jpg/220px-GommeBakel.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stabilizer","chemistry"],["binder","material"],["binder","material"],["white_space","visual_arts"]],"members":["binder","white_space","stabilizer"],"related":["Natural_gum","Sap","Acacia","Sahel","Senegal","Sudan","Somalia","Arabia","West_Asia","Mixture","Glycoprotein","Polysaccharide","Arabinose","Ribose","Food_industry","Stabilizer_(chemistry)","E_number","Lithography","Viscosity","Ink","Sahel","Gelato","Mixture","Glycoprotein","Toxicity","Soft_drink","Syrup","Gumdrops","Marshmallow","M&M's","Artist","Binder_(material)","Watercolor","Paint","Gum_printing","Pyrotechnic","Dialysis","Pharmaceutical","Cosmetics","Wine","Fining_agent","Shoe_polish","Adhesive","Postage_stamp_gum","Cigarette_papers","Oxidation","Aluminium","Printing","Printing_press","Binder_(material)","Watercolor_painting","Pigment","Diluent","Paper","Paper","Photography","Gum_printing","Ammonium_dichromate","Potassium_dichromate","Pigment","Emulsion","Ultraviolet","Etching","Lithography","Ink","White_space_(visual_arts)","Photosensitive","Lithography","Phosphoric_acid","Black","Ink","Firework","Surface_tension","Liquid","Carbonated_beverage","Diet_Coke_and_Mentos_eruption","Acacia_senegal","Acacia_seyal","East_Africa","Transhumance","Agriculture_in_Mauritania","Economy_of_Niger","Economy_of_Chad","Economy_of_Sudan","2004_locust_outbreak","Desert_locust","Henry_the_Navigator","Arguin","Slaves","Trarza","Brakna","Arabia","Encyclopædia_Britannica","Bakel","Senegal_river","Senegal","Mauritania","French_West_Africa","Atlantic_slave_trade","Emirate_of_Trarza","Saint-Louis,_Senegal","Portendick","Franco-Trarzan_War_of_1825","Muhammad_al_Habib","Waalo","Senegal_River","West_Africa","French_West_Africa","French_Equatorial_Africa","Decolonization","Sudan","Osama_bin_Laden","Urban_legend","Sudan","Boycott","September_11,_2001_Terrorist_Attacks","United_States_Department_of_State","John_Ukec_Lueth_Ukec","Janjaweed","NPR"]}
