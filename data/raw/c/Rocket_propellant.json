{"cursor":"28840","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Rocket propellant' is a material used by a rocket as, or to produce in a\nchemical reaction, the reaction mass (propulsive mass) that is ejected,\ntypically with very high speed, from a rocket engine to produce thrust, and thus\nprovide spacecraft propulsion.\n\nIn a chemical rocket propellants undergo exothermic chemical reactions to\nproduce hot gas. There may be a single propellant, or multiple propellants; in\nthe latter case one can distinguish fuel and oxidizer. The gases produced expand\nand push on a nozzle, which accelerates them until they rush out of the back of\nthe rocket at extremely high speed.\n\nFor smaller attitude control thrusters, a compressed gas escapes the spacecraft\nthrough a propelling nozzle.\n\nA potential other method is that the propellant is not burned but just heated.\n\nIn ion propulsion, the propellant is made of electrically charged atoms\n(ions), which are electromagnetically pushed out of the back of the\nspacecraft. Magnetically accelerated ion drives are not usually considered to\nbe rockets however, but a similar class of thrusters use electrical heating\nand magnetic nozzles.\n\nIn pulse propulsion, a heavy, metallic base acquires the force from an explosion\nbehind it, for example from an atomic bomb, and a transfers it to a dampening\nsystem that reduces the shock to the payload.\n","linknr":330,"url":"Rocket_propellant","recorded":1362477496,"links":34,"instances":["rocket_family","propellant","rocket_stage","missile","rocket_family","rocket_family","rocket_family","rocket_family"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rocket propellants","Pyrotechnics","Spacecraft propulsion"],"headings":["Overview","Chemical propellants","Inert propellants","Mixture ratio","Propellant density","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg/40px-Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Atlantis_taking_off_on_STS-27.jpg/220px-Atlantis_taking_off_on_STS-27.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/5/6/8560b297ef1b1e5e79842f4079a44591.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/6/69691c7bdcc3ce6d5d8a1361f22d04ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/6/286cdb3e335217efcbe3d793a28e07e7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/8/1/f81efaeb28b8b2f59760c653bd735e71.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/6/69691c7bdcc3ce6d5d8a1361f22d04ac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["r-36","missile"],["falcon","rocket_family"],["soyuz","rocket_family"],["zenit","rocket_family"],["angara","rocket_family"],["centaur","rocket_stage"],["long_march","rocket_family"],["alice","propellant"]],"members":["angara","alice","centaur","long_march","soyuz","falcon","zenit"],"related":["Rocket","Reaction_mass","Rocket_engine","Thrust","Spacecraft_propulsion","Chemical_rocket","Exothermic","Chemical_reaction","Fuel","Oxidizer","Attitude_control","Ion_propulsion","Ion","Electromagnetism","Mass","Newton's_laws_of_motion","Gas","Mass_flow_rate","Isaac_Newton","Outer_space","Mass_ratio","Single-stage_rocket","Mass_fraction","Saturn_V","Kerosene","Liquid_oxygen","Liquid_hydrogen","Space_Shuttle","Solid_rocket_booster","Space_Shuttle_Main_Engines","Ammonium_nitrate","Ammonium_perchlorate","Potassium_nitrate","Potassium_sulphide","Ammonium_Perchlorate_Composite_Propellant","Ammonium_perchlorate","Aluminium","PBAN","HTPB","Solid-fuel_rocket","LGM-30_Minuteman","LG-118A_Peacekeeper","RT-23","RT-2PM","RT-2UTTH","R-36_(missile)","UR-100N","Space_Shuttle","Launch_vehicle","Solid_rocket_booster","Specific_impulse","Liquid_oxygen","Kerosene","RP-1","Saturn_V","Atlas_V","Falcon_(rocket_family)","Soyuz_(rocket_family)","Zenit_(rocket_family)","Angara_(rocket_family)","Long_March_6","Robert_Goddard","Liquid_oxygen","Liquid_hydrogen","Space_Shuttle","Centaur_(rocket_stage)","Saturn_V","Delta_IV_rocket","H-IIA","Ariane_5","Nitrogen_tetroxide","Hydrazine","Monomethylhydrazine","UDMH","Proton_rocket","Long_March_(rocket_family)","PSLV","Fregat","Briz-M","Hypergolic","Monopropellant","Hydrogen_peroxide","Hydrazine","Nitrous_oxide","Attitude_control","Orbital_station-keeping","List_of_stoffs","Messerschmitt_Me_163","Walter_HWK_109-509","V-2","SRBM","Syntin","Specific_impulse","Turbopump","Liquid_oxygen","Nitrogen_tetroxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","Ammonium_perchlorate","Propulsive_Fluid_Accumulator","Upper_atmosphere","Low-Earth_orbit","Propellant_depot","Nitric_acid","Oxygen","Fluorine","Ozone","Chlorine_trifluoride","Chlorine_pentafluoride","Vernier_engine","Oxygen","Buran_program","Hybrid_rocket","Nitrous_oxide","Brigham_Young_University","University_of_Utah","Utah_State_University","Hydroxy-terminated_polybutadiene","Stanford_University","Paraffin_wax","Scaled_Composites_SpaceShipOne","SpaceDev","Dream_Chaser","Gel","Water_rocket","Solar_thermal_rocket","Nuclear_thermal_rocket","Specific_impulse","Fuel-rich","Stoichiometry","Corrosive","RD-180","Gravity_drag","Tripropellant_rocket","Space_Shuttle","ALICE_(propellant)","Trinitramide","Timeline_of_hydrogen_technologies","Aviation_fuel","Nuclear_propulsion","Ion_thruster"]}
