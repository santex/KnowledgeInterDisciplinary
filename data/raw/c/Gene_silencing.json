{"cursor":"3622","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Gene silencing' is a general term describing epigenetic processes of gene\nregulation. The term gene silencing is generally used to describe the \"switching\noff\" of a gene by a mechanism other than genetic modification. That is, a gene\nwhich would be expressed (\"turned on\") under normal circumstances is switched\noff by machinery in the cell. Gene silencing occurs when RNA is unable to make a\nprotein during translation.\n\nGenes are regulated at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level.\n\nTranscriptional gene silencing is the result of histone modifications, creating\nan environment of heterochromatin around a gene that makes it inaccessible to\ntranscriptional machinery (RNA polymerase, transcription factors, etc.).\n\nPost-transcriptional gene silencing is the result of mRNA of a particular gene\nbeing destroyed or blocked. The destruction of the mRNA prevents translation to\nform an active gene product (in most cases, a protein). A common mechanism of\npost-transcriptional gene silencing is RNAi.\n\nBoth transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing are used to\nregulate endogenous genes. Mechanisms of gene silencing also protect the\norganism's genome from transposons and viruses. Gene silencing thus may be part\nof an ancient immune system protecting from such infectious DNA elements.\n\nGenes may be silenced by DNA methylation during meiosis, as in the filamentous\nfungus Neurospora crassa.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Gene_silencing","recorded":1362481202,"links":22,"instances":["genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","Epigenetics","DNA","RNA","Posttranslational modification"],"headings":["Specific studies of gene silencing","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["transvection","genetics"]],"members":["transvection","translation","transcription"],"related":["Epigenetic","Gene_regulation","Genetic_modification","Gene","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","Histone","Heterochromatin","RNA_polymerase","Transcription_factors","Messenger_RNA","Translation","Protein","RNAi","Transposon","Virus","DNA","DNA_methylation","Meiosis","Neurospora_crassa","Genomic_Imprinting","Paramutation","Position_effect","RNA-directed_DNA_methylation","RNA_interference","Nonsense_mediated_decay","Transvection_(genetics)","Histone","Chromatin","Heterochromatin","MicroRNA","Small_interfering_RNA","DsRNA","Dicer","Transposon","Ribozyme","SiRNA","Antisense_RNA","Morpholino","Peptide_nucleic_acid"]}
