No crew were\nlost and it was refloated and was sailed to Sydney, arriving on 24 July. It was\nrepaired, including installing new masts. On 11 December 1809 the Active, again\nunder the command of Bader and with a sealing party aboard, headed for the Open\nBay Islands on the west coast of New Zealand. The sealing party was landed on a\nsmall island on 16 February 1810 then the Active set sail for Sydney and was\nnever seen again.\n\nThe sealing party remained stranded until rescued in 1813 by the ship [[Governor\nBligh (ship)|Governor Bligh]], returning to Sydney on 15 December\n1813.
