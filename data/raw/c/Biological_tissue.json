A tissue is an ensemble of similar cells from the same origin\nthat together carry out a specific function. Organs are then formed by the\nfunctional grouping together of multiple tissues.\n\nThe study of tissue is known as histology or, in connection with disease,\nhistopathology. The classical tools for studying tissues are the paraffin block\nin which tissue is embedded and then sectioned, the histological stain, and the\noptical microscope. In the last couple of decades, developments in electron\nmicroscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue sections have\nenhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. With these tools, the\nclassical appearances of tissues can be examined in health and disease, enabling\nconsiderable refinement of clinical diagnosis and prognosis.\n","linknr":541,"url":"Biological_tissue","recorded":1362510642,"links":97,"instances":["anatomy","botany","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Tissues|","Underwater diving physiology"],"headings":["Animal tissues","Plant tissues","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Padlock-silver.svg/20px-Padlock-silver.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Plant_cell_type_sclerenchyma_fibers.png/300px-Plant_cell_type_sclerenchyma_fibers.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Emphysema_H_and_E.jpg/300px-Emphysema_H_and_E.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Histoplasma_pas-d_small.jpg/220px-Histoplasma_pas-d_small.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg/250px-Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Plant_cell_type_collenchyma.png/220px-Plant_cell_type_collenchyma.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png/20px-Helmet_logo_for_Underwater_Diving_portal.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/SpongeDiver.jpg/100px-SpongeDiver.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["origin","anatomy"],["epidermis","botany"],["epidermis","botany"]],"members":["origin","epidermis","cell"],"related":["Hematoxylin","Eosin","Cell_(biology)","Organism","Origin_(anatomy)","Organs","Histology","Histopathology","Staining","Microscope","Electron_microscopy","Immunofluorescence","Microtome","Prognosis","Histoplasma","Connective_tissue","Muscle_tissue","Nervous_tissue","Epithelium","Epithelium","Ectoderm","Endoderm","Mesoderm","Endothelium","Blood_vessels","Epithelial_tissue","Tight_junctions","Skin","Basal_lamina","Extracellular_matrix","Muscle_cell","Muscle_tissue","Smooth_muscle","Skeletal_muscle","Cardiac_muscle","Heart","Central_nervous_system","Peripheral_nervous_system","Brain","Spinal_cord","Cranial_nerves","Spinal_nerves","Motor_neurons","Skin","Airway","Reproductive_tract","Digestive_tract","Tight_junctions","Secretion","Digestion","Multicellular","Vascular_tissue","Plant","Xylem","Phloem","Epidermis_(botany)","Ground_tissue","Vascular_tissue","Biomass","Leaf","Xylem","Phloem","Cellular_differentiation","Photosynthesis","Meristem","Meristem","Meristem","Vascular_cambium","Meristem","Cellulose","Cytoplasm","Cell_nucleus","Protoplasm","Polygonal","Cellular_differentiation","Parenchyma","Collenchyma","Sclerenchyma","Epidermis_(botany)","Collenchyma","Parenchyma","Cellulose","Pectin","Hypodermis","Monocots","Sclerenchyma","Lignin","Lignin","Transverse_section","Middle_lamella","Hypodermis","Pericycle","Pectin","Lignin","Protein","Lignified","Piths","Xylem","Vascular_plants","Sieve_tube","Sieve_cell","Companion_cell","Plant_stem_cell","Cellular_differentiation","Laser_capture_microdissection","Tissue_microarray","Tissue_stress"]}
