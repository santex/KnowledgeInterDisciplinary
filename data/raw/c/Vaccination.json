Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection. The\neffectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example,\nthe influenza vaccine, the HPV vaccine, and the chicken\npox vaccine.

Toxoids are produced for\nimmunization against toxin-based diseases, such as the modification of\ntetanospasmin toxin of tetanus to remove its toxic effect but retain its\nimmunogenic effect. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tet-\nanus.pdf\n\nSmallpox was likely the first disease people tried to prevent by purposely\ninoculating themselves with other infections and was the first disease for which a vaccine was\nproduced. The smallpox vaccine was designed in 1796 by the British physician\nEdward Jenner, although at least six people had used the same principles several\nyears earlier. Louis Pasteur furthered the concept\nthrough his pioneering work in microbiology. The immunization was called\nvaccination because it was derived from a virus affecting cows ()(). Smallpox was a contagious and deadly\ndisease, causing the deaths of 20â60% of infected adults and over 80% of\ninfected children. When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979,\nduring the 20th century alone it had killed an estimated 300â500 million people-\n.

This\ndistinguishes it from inoculation, which uses unweakened live pathogens,\nalthough in common usage either is used to refer to an immunization. Vaccination\nefforts have been met with some controversy since their inception, on\nscientific, ethical, political, medical safety, and religious grounds. In rare\ncases, vaccinations can injure people and, in the United States, they may\nreceive compensation for those injuries under the National Vaccine Injury\nCompensation Program. Early success and compulsion brought widespread\nacceptance, and mass vaccination campaigns have greatly reduced the incidence of\nmany diseases in numerous geographic regions.\n","recorded":1362124025,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"476","instances":["medical","medicine","biology","medicina"],"pdf":["http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf","http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.15_TURKEY_RHINO.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/oid/docs/ID-Framework.pdf","http://virtualbiosecuritycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Library-NIAID-Biodefense-Research-Agenda-for-Category-B-and-C-Priority-Pathogens.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/tetanus.pdf","http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf","http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf","http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7361/430.full.pdf"],"categories":["Vaccination|
