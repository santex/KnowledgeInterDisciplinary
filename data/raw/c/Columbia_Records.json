It was founded in 1888,\nevolving from an earlier enterprise, the American Graphophone Companyâsuccessor\nto the Volta Graphophone Company. Bilton, Lynn.\n[http://www.intertique.com/TheColumbiaGraphophoneAndGrafonola.html The Columbia\nGraphophone and Grafonola -A Beginner's Guide]. Intertique.com website, 2007.\nRetrieved 19 December 2009. Columbia is the oldest brand name in pre-\nrecorded sound, being the first record company to produce\npre-recorded records as opposed to blank cylinders. Columbia Records went on to\nrelease records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands.\nFrom 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada on\nthe 'CBS Records' label (for Columbia Broadcasting System, its parent from 1938\nto 1988) before adopting the Columbia name in most of the world.\n\nIt is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels with the others being\nEpic Records and RCA Records.\n\nUntil 1989, Columbia Records had no connection to Columbia Pictures, which used\nvarious other names for record labels they owned, including Colpix and later\nArista; rather, it was connected to CBS, which stood for 'C'olumbia\n'B'roadcasting 'S'ystem, a broadcasting media company which purchased Columbia\nRecords in the late 1930s, and which had been co-founded in 1927 by Columbia\nRecords itself. Though Arista was later sold to BMG, it is now a sister label to\nColumbia Records through Sony Music; both are connected to Columbia Pictures\nthrough Sony Corporation of America, worldwide parent of both the music and\nmotion picture arms of Sony.\n","linknr":921,"url":"Columbia_Records","recorded":1362569209,"links":74,"instances":["2006","producer","music_industry","nathan_milstein_album","musician","the_mighty_quinn","album","uk","us","singer","musician"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American
