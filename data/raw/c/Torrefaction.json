{"cursor":"8972","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Torrefaction', also referred to as Torrefecation (French for roasting), of\nbiomass, e.g. wood, can be described as a mild form of pyrolysis at temperatures\ntypically ranging between 200 and 320 Â°C. During torrefaction, the biomass\nproperties are changed to obtain a much better fuel quality for combustion and\ngasification applications. Torrefaction leads to a dry product with no\nbiological activity like rotting. Torrefaction combined with densification leads\nto a very energy-dense fuel carrier of 20 to 25 GJ/ton lower heating value\n(LHV).  Torrefaction makes the material undergo Maillard reactions.\n\nBiomass can sometimes be an important energy source to create a more sustainable\nsociety. However, nature provides a large diversity of biomass with varying\ncharacteristics. In order to create highly efficient biomass-to-energy chains,\ntorrefaction of biomass in combination with densification (pelletisation or\nbriquetting) is a promising step to overcome logistic economics in large-scale\nsustainable energy solutions, i.e. make it easier to transport and store it.\nPellets or briquets are lighter, drier and stable in storage as opposed to the\nbiomass they are made of.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Torrefaction","recorded":1362500033,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pyrolysis","Fuel production"],"headings":["Process","Added value of torrefied biomass","Markets for torrefied biomass","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Pyrolysis.svg/250px-Pyrolysis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biomass","Pyrolysis","Gigajoule","Lower_heating_value","Maillard_reaction","Pelletisation","Briquetting","Logistics","Sustainable_energy","Thermochemical","Oxygen","Cellulose","Hemicellulose","Lignin","Bioresource_Technology","Barley","Maize","Oats","Wheat","Gelatin","Starch","Endosperm","Wood_pellets","Gigajoule","Lignocellulose","Cellulose","Hemicellulose","Lignin","Lignocellulose","Hydrophobic","Lower_Heating_Value","Gigajoule","Fischer–Tropsch_process"]}
