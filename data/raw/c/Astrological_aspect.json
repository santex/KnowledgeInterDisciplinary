{"cursor":"13446","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In astrology, an 'aspect' is an angle the planets make to each other in the\nhoroscope, and also to the ascendant, midheaven, descendant, lower midheaven,\nand other points of astrological interest. Aspects are measured by the angular\ndistance in degrees and minutes of ecliptic longitude between two points, as\nviewed from Earth. According to astrological tradition, they indicate the timing\nof transitions and developmental changes in the lives of people and affairs\nrelative to the Earth.\n\nAs an example, if an astrologer creates a horoscope that shows the apparent\npositions of the celestial bodies at the time of a person's birth (a natal\nchart), and the angular distance between Mars and Venus is 92Â° of arc, the chart\nis said to have the aspect \"Venus square Mars\" with an orb of 2Â° (i.e., it is 2Â°\naway from being an exact square; a square is a 90Â° aspect). The more exact that\nan aspect is, the stronger or more dominant it is said to be in shaping\ncharacter or manifesting change.\n\n, where the different colors and symbols distinguish between the different\naspects, such as the square (red) or trine (blue)]]\n","linknr":319,"url":"Astrological_aspect","recorded":1362899132,"links":25,"instances":["astronomy_and_astrology","astrology","astronomy_and_astrology","astrology","astrological_aspect","astrology","astrology","astrologer","astrology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Astrological aspects|*","Technical factors of astrology","Astrology","Ephemerides"],"headings":["Approach","Ternary aspects","References and further reading","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Natal_Chart_--_Adam.jpg/500px-Natal_Chart_--_Adam.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Astrologia-tynk%C3%A4.jpg/29px-Astrologia-tynk%C3%A4.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Astrologyproject.svg/120px-Astrologyproject.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["descendant","astrology"],["square","astrological_aspect"],["orb","astrology"],["square","astrological_aspect"],["john_addey","astrologer"],["hard_aspect","astrology"],["soft_aspect","astrology"],["applying_aspect","astrology"],["conjunction","astronomy_and_astrology"],["opposition","astronomy_and_astrology"]],"members":["conjunction","applying_aspect","opposition","orb","square","descendant","hard_aspect","john_addey","soft_aspect"],"related":["Astrology","Angle","Planets_in_astrology","Horoscope","Ascendant","Midheaven","Descendant_(astrology)","Imum_coeli","Ecliptic","Astrologer","Horoscope","Natal_chart","Square_(astrological_aspect)","Orb_(astrology)","Square_(astrological_aspect)","Planet","Benefic_planet","Malefic_planet","John_Addey_(astrologer)","Johannes_Kepler","Germany","Uranian_astrology","Cosmobiology","Empirical","Astrological_sign","Astrological_houses","Reinhold_Ebertin","Michel_Gauquelin","Uranian_astrology","Hamburg_School_of_Astrology","Declination","Ecliptic","Hard_aspect_(astrology)","Soft_aspect_(astrology)","Applying_aspect_(astrology)","Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology)","Opposition_(astronomy_and_astrology)","Cosmobiology","Hamburg_School_of_Astrology","Uranian_astrology","Midnight","GMT"]}
