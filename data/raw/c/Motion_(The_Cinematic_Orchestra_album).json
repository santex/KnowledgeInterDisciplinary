The album's concept came from core band member, Jason\nSwinscoe, who had amassed various samples - drum patterns, basslines and melody\nsamples - that had inspired and influenced him. He then presented them to a\ngroup of musicians to learn and then improvise around. The resulting draft\ntracks were then re-mixed on computer by Swinscoe to create the finished\nalbum. allmusic.com [ Review \"Motion\"]\n","linknr":121,"url":"Motion_(The_Cinematic_Orchestra_album)","recorded":1362668064,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["1999 debut albums","The Cinematic Orchestra albums"],"headings":["Critical reaction","Track listing","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/CinematicOrchestra_Motion_albumcover.jpg/220px-CinematicOrchestra_Motion_albumcover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["The_Cinematic_Orchestra","Jazz","Electronica","Downtempo","Ninja_Tune","Remixes_1998-2000","LP_album","The_Cinematic_Orchestra","Ninja_Tune","Allmusic","Pitchfork_Media","Allmusic","Director's_Guild_of_Great_Britain","Lifetime_Achievement_Award","Stanley_Kubrick","The_Cinematic_Orchestra","Japan","Hefner","Four_Tet"]}
