Its aims are to host all forms of\nfree text, in many languages, and translations. Originally conceived as an\narchive to store useful or important historical texts, it has expanded to become\na general-content library. The project officially began in November 24, 2003\nunder the name 'Project Sourceberg'. The name Wikisource was adopted later that\nyear and it received its own domain name seven months later. The project has\ncome under criticism for lack of reliability but it is also cited by\norganisations such as the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nThe project holds works that are either in the public domain or freely licenced;\nprofessionally published works or historical source documents, not vanity\nproducts; and are verifiable. Verification was initially made offline, or by\ntrusting the reliability of other digital libraries. Now works are supported by\nonline scans via the ProofReadPage extension, which ensures the reliability and\naccuracy of the project's texts. Some Wikisources now only allow works backed up\nwith scans. While the bulk of its collection are texts, Wikisource hosts other\nmedia, from comics to film to audio books. The only original works allowed on\nWikisource are translations and annotations.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"wikisource","recorded":1371065255,"links":[],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Aggregation-based digital libraries","E-book suppliers","Internet properties established in 2003","Wikimedia projects|Source, Wiki","Multilingual websites","Proofreading"],"headings":["History","Library contents","Structure","Reception","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Digital_library","Wikimedia_Foundation","Digital_library","Free_content","Source_text","Wiki","Wikimedia_Foundation","Domain_name","National_Archives_and_Records_Administration","Public_domain","Freely_licenced","Vanity_press","URL","Project_Gutenberg","Edit_war","Nupedia","Larry_Sanger","Jimmy_Wales","ISO_639-1","Pashto_language","Iceberg","MediaWiki","Image_processing","Portable_Document_Format","DjVu","Wikimedia_Commons","Francis_Bicknell_Carpenter","Digitizing","Creative_Commons","Vanity_press","Wikimedia_Foundation","Wikimedia_Foundation","List_of_digital_library_projects","Wikibooks","Annotated_novel","The_Bible","Hebrew_language","Bi-directional_text","German_language","Brion_Vibber","Wikipedia","Wikiversity","Larry_Sanger","Wiktionary","Bart_D._Ehrman","University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill","Richard_Elliott_Friedman","University_of_Georgia","Book_of_Genesis","Biblioth√®que_nationale_de_France","Optical_character_recognition","National_Archives_and_Records_Administration","Dominic_McDevitt-Parks","Angela_Beesley"]}
