B cells can be distinguished from other lymphocytes,\nsuch as T cells and natural killer cells (NK cells), by the presence of a\nprotein on the B cell's outer surface known as a B cell receptor '(BCR)'. This\nspecialized receptor protein allows a B cell to bind to a 'specific' antigen.\n\nThe principal functions of B cells are to make antibodies against antigens, to\nperform the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and to develop into memory\nB cells after activation by antigen interaction. Recently, a new, suppressive\nfunction of B cells has been discovered.\n\nThe abbreviation \"B\", in B cell, comes from the bursa of Fabricius in birds,\nwhere they mature. In mammals, immature B cells are formed in the bone marrow,\nwhich is used as a backronym for the cells' name.
