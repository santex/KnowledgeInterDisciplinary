{"cursor":"12252","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn electrolyte is a compound that ionises when dissolved in suitable ionising\nsolvents such as water. This includes most soluble salts acids and bases. Some\ngases eg hydrogen chloride and also others under conditions of high temperature\nor low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can\nalso result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., DNA, polypeptides)\nand synthetic polymers (e.g., polystyrene sulfonate), termed polyelectrolytes,\nwhich contain charged functional groups.\n\nElectrolyte solutions are normally formed when a salt is placed into a solvent\nsuch as water and the individual components dissociate due to the thermodynamic\ninteractions between solvent and solute molecules, in a process called\nsolvation. For example, when table salt, NaCl, is placed in water, the salt (a\nsolid) dissolves into its component ions, according to the dissociation reaction\n:NaCl (s) â Na +(aq) +\nCl â (aq) It is also possible for substances to react with\nwater producing ions, e.g., carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water to produce a\nsolution which contains hydronium, carbonate, and hydrogen carbonate ions.\n\nNote that molten salts can be electrolytes as well. For instance, when sodium\nchloride is molten, the liquid conducts electricity.\n\nAn electrolyte in a solution may be described as concentrated if it has a high\nconcentration of ions, or dilute if it has a low concentration. If a high\nproportion of the solute dissociates to form free ions, the electrolyte is\nstrong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the electrolyte is weak. The\nproperties of electrolytes may be exploited using electrolysis to extract\nconstituent elements and compounds contained within the solution.\n","linknr":319,"url":"Electrolyte","recorded":1362482484,"links":64,"instances":["element","electricity","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrolytes|","Blood tests","Urine tests","Physical chemistry","Acid-base physiology"],"headings":["Physiological importance","Electrochemistry","Solid electrolytes","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Galvanic_Cell.svg/150px-Galvanic_Cell.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dissociation","chemistry"],["battery","electricity"],["mercury","element"]],"members":["mercury","battery","dissociation"],"related":["DNA","Polypeptides","Polystyrene_sulfonate","Solvation","Physiology","Sodium","Potassium","Calcium","Magnesium","Chloride","Hydrogen_phosphate","Hydrogen_carbonate","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Intracellular","Extracellular","Osmotic","Ion_gradient","Rehydration","Blood","PH","Nerve","Muscle","Extracellular_fluid","Interstitial_fluid","Intracellular_fluid","Plasma_membrane","Ion_channels","Muscle_contraction","Hormone","Kidney","Homeostasis","Antidiuretic_hormone","Aldosterone","Parathyroid_hormone","Electrolyte_disturbance","Dehydration","Water_intoxication","Medical_emergency","Blood_test","Ion_selective_electrode","Urinalysis","Medical_technologist","Medical_history","Renal_function","Arterial_blood_gas","Specific_gravity","Electrolyte_imbalance","Oral_rehydration_therapy","Water","Dehydration","Exercise","Alcohol_abuse","Diaphoresis","Diarrhea","Vomiting","Substance_intoxication","Starvation","Marathon","Triathlon","Hyponatremia","Fruit_juices","Coconut_water","Sports_drink","Potatoes","Avocados","Electrode","Voltage","Electron","Cathode","Anode","Sodium_chloride","Hydrogen","Chlorine","Diffusion","Battery_(electricity)","Material","Fuel_cell","Proton_conductor","Electroplating","Mercury_(element)","Electrolytic_capacitor","Dielectric","Electrical_insulation","Hygrometer","Strong_electrolyte","ITIES"]}
