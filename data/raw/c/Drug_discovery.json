{"cursor":"25884","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In the fields of medicine, biotechnology and pharmacology, 'drug discovery' is\nthe process by which new candidate medications are discovered.\n\nHistorically, drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient\nfrom traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery. Later chemical\nlibraries of synthetic small molecules, natural products or extracts were\nscreened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a\ndesirable therapeutic effect in a process known as classical pharmacology. Since\nsequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of\nlarge quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use high\nthroughput screening of large compounds libraries against isolated biological\ntargets which are hypothesized to be disease modifying in a process known as\nreverse pharmacology. Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then\nin animals for efficacy. Even more recently, scientists have been able to\nunderstand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use\nthat knowledge to design (see drug design) drug candidates.\n\nModern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, medicinal\nchemistry and optimization of those hits to increase the affinity, selectivity\n(to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/potency, metabolic stability\n(to increase the half-life), and oral bioavailability. Once a compound that\nfulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the\nprocess of drug development prior to clinical trials. One or more of these steps\nmay, but not necessarily, involve computer-aided drug design.\n\nDespite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug\ndiscovery is still a lengthy, \"expensive, difficult, and inefficient process\"\nwith low rate of new therapeutic discovery. {{Cite news\n | last1 = Anson | first1 = Blake D. | last2 = Ma | first2 = Junyi | last3 = He\n | | first3
