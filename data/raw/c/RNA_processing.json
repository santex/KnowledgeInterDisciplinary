{"cursor":"7003","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Co-transcriptional modification' is a process in cell biology by which, in\neukaryotic cells, primary transcript RNA is converted into mature RNA. A notable\nexample is the conversion of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA\n(mRNA), which includes splicing and occurs prior to protein synthesis. This\nprocess is vital for the correct translation of the genomes of eukaryotes\nbecause the human primary RNA transcript that is produced, as a result of\ntranscription, contains both exons, which are coding sections of the primary RNA\ntranscript and introns, which are the non-coding sections of the primary RNA\ntranscript.\n","linknr":307,"url":"RNA_processing","recorded":1362374314,"links":27,"instances":["genetics","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["RNA"],"headings":["mRNA processing","Citations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Conserved_Polyadenylation_Sequence.svg/700px-Conserved_Polyadenylation_Sequence.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["splicing","genetics"],["transcription","biology"],["translation","biology"],["poly(a_tail"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["splicing","translation","transcription"],"related":["Cell_biology","Eukaryotic_cells","Primary_transcript","RNA","Precursor_messenger_RNA","Mature_messenger_RNA","Messenger_RNA","Splicing_(genetics)","Protein_synthesis","Translation","Genome","Eukaryote","Transcription_(biology)","Exons","Introns","5'_cap","Polyadenylation","RNA_splicing","Cell_nucleus","Translation_(biology)","7-methylguanosine","Phosphatase","Guanosyl_transferase","Diphosphate","Guanosine_triphosphate","Guanine","S-adenosyl_methionine","Ribose","Nucleotide","Ribonuclease","Phosphodiester_bond","Adenine","Poly(A)_tail","Polyadenylation","Protein","Cleavage_and_polyadenylation_specificity_factor","Cleavage_stimulation_factor","RNA_Polymerase_II","Polyadenylate_Polymerase","Adenosine_triphosphate","Intron","Exon","Spliceosome","Small_nuclear_RNA","Splice_site","Antibody","Primary_structure","Alternative_splicing","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(genetics)","RNA_editing","RNA-Seq","New_York","Leeds"]}
