Greeno & Moore, 1993\n\nUnder this assumption, which requires an epistemological shift from empiricism,\nsituativity theorists suggest a model of knowledge and learning that requires\nthinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual\nknowledge. In essence, cognition cannot be separated from the context. Instead\nknowing exists, in situ, inseparable from context, activity, people, culture,\nand language. Therefore, learning is seen in terms of an individual's\nincreasingly effective performance across situations rather than in terms of an\naccumulation of knowledge, since what is known is co-determined by the agent\nand the context. This perspective rejects mind-body dualism and person-\nenvironment dualism.\n","linknr":414,"url":"Situated_cognition","recorded":1362684333,"links":15,"instances":["computing","psychology"],"pdf":["http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/papers/135/NEW.AGRS_Jan_202000.pdf","http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/papers/135/NEW.AGRS_Jan_202000.pdf"],"categories":["Cognitive science","Enactive cognition","Educational psychology"],"headings":["History","Glossary","Key principles","[[Externalism]]","Pedagogical Implications","Research Methodologies","Critiques of Situativity","See also","References","Citations & Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/88/PS_Dynamics.jpg/220px-PS_Dynamics.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["avatar","computing"],["cognitivism","psychology"]],"members":["avatar","cognitivism"],"related":["John_Seely_Brown","Epistemological","Mind-body_dualism","Educational_psychology","Critical_theory","Anthropology","Jean_Lave","Martin_Heidegger","Critical_discourse_analysis","Sociolinguistics","Empiricism","Communities_of_practice","Ecological_psychology","J._J._Gibson","Autonomous_agent","New_literacies","Affordance","Community_of_practice","Embodied_cognition","Legitimate_peripheral_participation","J._J._Gibson","Discourse","Jean_Lave","Embodied_cognition","Externalism","Direct_Instruction","Project_Based_Learning","Problem_Based_Learning","Cognitive_Apprenticeship","Instructional_scaffolding","Avatar_(computing)","Information_processing","Cognitivism_(psychology)","Action-Specific_Perception","Activity_theory","Computer-supported_collaborative_learning","Distributed_cognition","Ecological_psychology","Embodied_cognition","Externalism","Enactivism","Group_cognition","Relational_frame_theory","Situational_awareness","Situated_learning"]}
