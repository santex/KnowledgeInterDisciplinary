The\nonly extant members of the Ruminantia that are not pecorans are the chevrotains,\nwhich lack horns and whose four-chambered stomachs are less developed than those\nof the pecorans. This gives rise to the pecorans sometimes being called \"horned\nruminants\". Pecorans are also known as \"higher ruminants\", because they arose\nmore recently than other ruminant groups. Although Pecora is well-supported as a\nclade, the exact relationships among families within it are in dispute.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Pecora","recorded":1362671205,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Even-toed ungulates"],"headings":["Classification","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Pronghorn_antelope.jpg/200px-Pronghorn_antelope.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Miocene","Pronghorn","Moschidae","Cervidae","Giraffidae","Antilocapridae","Bovidae","Ruminant","Extant_taxon","Ruminantia","Chevrotain","Clade","Suina","Tylopoda","Cetruminantia","Cervidae","Deer","Gelocidae","Palaeomerycidae","Hoplitomerycidae","Climacoceratidae","Giraffidae","Giraffe","Okapi","Antilocapridae","Pronghorn","Leptomerycidae","Moschidae","Musk_deer","Bovidae","Cattle","Goat","Sheep","Antelope"]}
