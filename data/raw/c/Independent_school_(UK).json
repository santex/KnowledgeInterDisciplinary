{"cursor":"31946","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", one of Britain's oldest independent schools.]] In the United Kingdom\n'Independent schools' (also 'private schools', sometimes 'public schools') are\nfee paying schools which are governed by an elected board of directors and are\nindependent of many of the regulations and conditions that apply to state funded\nschools. In addition to charging tuition fees, many also benefit from gifts,\ncharitable endowments and charitable status. There are around 2,500 independent\nschools in the UK, which educate around 615,000 children, being some 7% of all\nBritish children and 18% of pupils over the age of 16. Many of these\nare members of the Independent Schools Council.\n\nSome of older, more expensive and more exclusive schools catering for the 13-18\nage-range in England and Wales are known as Public schools, the term 'public'\nbeing derived from the fact that they were open to pupils regardless of where\nthey lived or their religion. Prep schools, (or preparatory school) educate\nyounger children up to the age of 13, and 'prepare' pupils for entry to thee\npublic schools and other independent schools. Some former grammar schools\nconverted to an independent fee paying model following the 1965 Circular 10/65\nwhich marked the end of their state funding, others converted into\ncomprehensive schools.\n","linknr":408,"url":"Independent_school_(UK)","recorded":1371237449,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(UK)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Warwick_School_front.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Warwick_School_front.jpg/300px-Warwick_School_front.jpg","/wiki/File:Warwick_School_front.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Warwick_School","/wiki/School","/wiki/Governance","/wiki/Education_in_England","/wiki/Charitable_organization","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Independent_Schools_Council","/wiki/Public_school_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Grammar_school","/wiki/Circular_10/65","/wiki/Comprehensive_school","#History","#Origins","#Victorian_expansion","#Modern_era","#The_present_day","#England_and_Wales","#Scotland","#Selection","#Conditions","#Criticisms","#School_type_and_eventual_degree_class","#See_also","#Notes","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=1","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_schools_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/The_King%27s_School,_Canterbury","/wiki/St_Peter%27s_School,_York","/wiki/Sherborne_School","/wiki/Edward_VI","/wiki/Warwick_School","/wiki/The_King%27s_School,_Ely","/wiki/St_Albans_School_(Hertfordshire)","/wiki/Winchester_College","/wiki/Oswestry_School","/wiki/Public_school_(UK)","/wiki/Westminster_School","/wiki/Financial_endowment","#cite_note-ISC_census-2","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Thomas_Arnold","/wiki/Rugby_School","/wiki/Shrewsbury_School","/wiki/Muscular_Christianity","/wiki/Edward_Thring","/wiki/Uppingham_School","/wiki/Victorian_era","/wiki/Gentleman","/wiki/Prefect","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/Direct_grant_grammar_school","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Mid-1970s_recession","#cite_note-4","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=5","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=6","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit","#cite_note-ISC-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Boarding_school","/wiki/List_of_state_boarding_schools_in_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Charitable_organization","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales","/wiki/Charities_Act_2006","/wiki/Independent_Schools_Council","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/File:Fettes_College,_Edinburgh.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Fettes_College%2C_Edinburgh.jpg/170px-Fettes_College%2C_Edinburgh.jpg","/wiki/File:Fettes_College,_Edinburgh.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/List_of_independent_schools_in_Scotland","/wiki/Scotland","/wiki/Scottish_Parliament","/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Inspectorate_of_Education","/wiki/Education_and_Lifelong_Learning_Directorate","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Dollar_Academy","/wiki/High_School_of_Glasgow","/wiki/The_Glasgow_Academy","/wiki/Kelvinside_Academy","/wiki/St._Aloysius%27_College,_Glasgow","/wiki/Hutchesons%27_Grammar_School","/wiki/George_Heriot%27s_School","/wiki/Stewart%27s_Melville_College","/wiki/Strathallan_School","/wiki/Glenalmond_College","/wiki/Merchiston_Castle_School","/wiki/Edinburgh_Academy","/wiki/Robert_Gordon%27s_College","/wiki/George_Watson%27s_College","/wiki/Loretto_School","/wiki/Gordonstoun","/wiki/St_Leonards_School","/wiki/Fettes_College","/wiki/Church_of_Scotland","#Preparatory_schools","/wiki/Cargilfield_Preparatory_School","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/w/index.php?title=Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/Discrimination","/wiki/Pound_Sterling","#cite_note-ISC_census-2","#cite_note-12"
