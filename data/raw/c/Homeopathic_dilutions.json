{"cursor":"18424","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nHomeopathy involves a process known by practitioners as \"dynamisation\" or\n\"potentisation\" whereby a substance is d with alcohol or distilled water and\nthen vigorously shaken in a process called \"succussion\". Insoluble solids, such\nas quartz and oyster shell, are diluted by grinding them with lactose\n([[trituration]]). The founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann (1755 â€”\n1843) believed that the process of succussion activated the \"vital energy\" of\nthe diluted substance, {{citation |author= Kayne SB |year=2006 |url=http:/-\n/books.google.com/?id=w2IFcHJYTSYC&pg=PA52&dq=homeopathic+proving+method\n|title=Homeopathic pharmacy: theory and practice |edition=2 |isbn= 978-0-443-10160-\n1 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |pages=53 }}. and that successive\ndilutions increased the \"potency\" of the remedy.\n\nThe idea is considered a pseudoscience, because at common dilutions, no atoms of\nthe original material are likely to remain. It is illogical that a process of\ndilution would arrive at a higher potency. There is not enough water on earth to\nproduce the highest homeopathic dilutions from one molecule.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Homeopathic_dilutions","recorded":1362569066,"links":19,"instances":["unit","unit"],"pdf":["http://philipmahler.name/Middlesex/MA1104/Chapter_5/Class%20Guide%205-3.pdf"],"categories":["Homeopathy"],"headings":["Potency scales","The paradox of homeopathic dilution","Proposed explanations","Dilution debate","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Arnica_montana_hom%C3%A9opathie_zoom.jpg/100px-Arnica_montana_hom%C3%A9opathie_zoom.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mole","unit"],["drop","unit"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["drop","mole"],"related":["Homeopathy","Distilled_water","Quartz","Oyster","Lactose","Samuel_Hahnemann","Avogadro_constant","Parts_per_million","Constantine_Hering","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Avogadro's_constant","Mole_(unit)","Water_memory","Oscillococcinum","Serial_dilution","Hydrofluoric_acid","Lake_Geneva","Sodium_chloride","Drop_(unit)","United_States_Geological_Survey","Oxford_University_Press","Influenza","Observable_universe","Olympic-size_swimming_pool","Olympic-size_swimming_pool","Ton","Addison-Wesley","Metric_tons","Molar_mass","Gram","Mole_(unit)","Density","Milliliter","Light_year","Light_year","Pathology","Miasm","Spirituality","Consumers_Union","Serial_dilution"]}
