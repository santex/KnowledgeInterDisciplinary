In practice, the\nterm \"cell culture\" now refers to the culturing of cells derived from multi-\ncellular eukaryotes, especially animal cells. However, there are also cultures\nof plants, fungi and microbes, including viruses, bacteria and protists. The\nhistorical development and methods of cell culture are closely interrelated to\nthose of tissue culture and organ culture.\n\nAnimal cell culture became a common laboratory technique in the mid-\n1900s, but the concept of maintaining live cell lines separated from\ntheir original tissue source was discovered in the 19th century.\n","linknr":786,"url":"Animal_cell_culture","recorded":1362503333,"links":46,"instances":["cell_biology","biology","biology","genetics","cell_line","genetics","cells","biology"],"pdf":["http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/reprint/74/4/1381.pdf","http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/reprint/154/8/3922.pdf","http://www.promega.com/cnotes/cn022/cn022_15.pdf","http://www.promega.com/cnotes/cn022/cn022_15.pdf"],"categories":["Biotechnology","Cell
