{"cursor":"12986","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" plasmid is one of the first plasmids widely used as a cloning vector.]] A\n 'cloning vector' is a small piece of DNA, taken from a virus, a plasmid, or the\n cell of a higher organism, that can be stably maintained in an organism, and\n into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted for cloning\n purposes. The vector therefore contains features that allow for the\n convenient insertion or removal of DNA fragment in or out of the vector, for\n example by treating the vector and the foreign DNA with a restriction enzyme\n that creates the same overhang, then ligating the fragments together. After a\n DNA fragment has been cloned into a cloning vector, it may be further subcloned\n into another vector designed for more specific use.\n\nThere are many types of cloning vectors, but the most commonly-used ones are\ngenetically engineered plasmids. Cloning is generally first performed using\n[[Escherichia coli]], and cloning vectors in E. coli include plasmids,\nbacteriophages (such as phage Î»), cosmids, and bacterial artificial chromosomes\n(BACs). Some DNA however cannot be stably maintained in E. coli, for example\nvery large DNA fragment, and other organisms such as yeast may be used. Cloning\nvector in yeast include yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs).\n","linknr":245,"url":"Cloning_vector","recorded":1362480565,"links":21,"instances":["biology","biology","molecular_biology","genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781588291516-c2.pdf","http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781588291516-c2.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular biology","Cloning","Plasmids"],"headings":["Features of a cloning vector","Types of cloning vectors","Screening: example of the blue/white selection","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/PBR322.svg/220px-PBR322.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/PUC19.svg/220px-PUC19.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Blue-white_test.jpg/220px-Blue-white_test.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transformation","genetics"],["promoter","biology"],["vector","molecular_biology"]],"members":["promoter","cell","vector","transformation"],"related":["DNA","Virus","Plasmid","Cell_(biology)","Molecular_cloning","Restriction_enzyme","DNA_ligase","Subcloned","Plasmid","Bacteriophage","Lambda_phage","Cosmids","Bacterial_artificial_chromosome","Yeast_artificial_chromosome","Molecular_biology","Origin_of_replication","ColE1","Shuttle_vector","Multiple_cloning_site","Restriction_enzyme","PCR","DNA_ligase","Sub-cloning","Topoisomerase","TOPO_cloning","Site-specific_recombination","Gateway_Technology","Selectable_marker","Transformation_(genetics)","Antibiotic","Beta-lactamase","Penicillin","Beta-lactam_antibiotics","Ampicillin","Lac_operon","Blue_white_screen","Marker_gene","Reporter_gene","Multiple_cloning_site","Fusion_protein","Green_fluorescent_protein","Luciferase","Gene_expression","Expression_vector","DNA","Promoter_(biology)","Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition","T7_phage","Lac_operon","Blue_white_screen","Ribosomal_binding_site","CDNA_library","PBR322","PUC19","M13_bacteriophage","Phagemid","PBluescript","Bacteriophage_lambda","M13_phage","Lysogeny","Cosmids","Bacterial_artificial_chromosome","Fertility_factor","P1-derived_artificial_chromosome","P1_phage","Yeast_artificial_chromosome","PUC19","Beta-galactosidase","X-gal","Vector_(molecular_biology)","IMAGE_cDNA_clones","Phagemid","Cosmid","Fosmid","P1-derived_artificial_chromosome","Human_artificial_chromosome"]}
