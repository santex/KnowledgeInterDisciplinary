[[Black's Law Dictionary]].\n6th edition. (St. Paul, MN: West, 1991).\n\nAggravated assault, for example, is usually differentiated from simple assault\nby the offender's intent (e.g., to murder or to rape), the extent of injury to\nthe victim, or the use of a deadly weapon. An aggravating circumstance is a kind\nof attendant circumstance and the opposite of an extenuating or mitigating\ncircumstance, which decreases guilt.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Aggravating_circumstance","recorded":1362574283,"links":20,"instances":["law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Criminal law","Tort law"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Standard_legirons_taiwan01.jpg/40px-Standard_legirons_taiwan01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intent","law"]],"members":["intent"],"related":["Law","Crime","Tort","Henry_Campbell_Black","Aggravated_assault","Simple_assault","Intent_(law)","Murder","Rape","Deadly_weapon","Attendant_circumstance","Extenuating_circumstances"]}
