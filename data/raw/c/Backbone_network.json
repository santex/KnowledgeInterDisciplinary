Normally, the backbone's capacity is\ngreater than the networks connected to it.\n\nA large corporation that has many locations may have a backbone network that\nties all of the locations together, for example, if a server cluster needs to be\naccessed by different departments of a company that are located at different\ngeographical locations. The pieces of the network connections (for example:\nethernet, wireless) that bring these departments together is often mentioned as\nnetwork backbone. Network congestion is often taken into consideration while\ndesigning backbones.\n\nBackbone networks should not be confused with the Internet backbone.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Backbone_network","recorded":1362538750,"links":20,"instances":["telecommunications"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Networks"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Crystal_Clear_app_network.png/35px-Crystal_Clear_app_network.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["backhaul","telecommunications"]],"members":["backhaul"],"related":["Computer_network","LAN","Subnetwork","Network_congestion","Internet_backbone","Backhaul_(telecommunications)","Collapsed_backbone","Core_network","Distributed_backbone","Parallel_backbone","Serial_backbone","Internet_backbone"]}
