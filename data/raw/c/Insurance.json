{"cursor":"96159","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Blackjack|the contract between insurer and insured|Insurance policy}}\n\n'Insurance' is the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to\nanother in exchange for payment. It is a form of risk management primarily used\nto hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss.\n\nAn insurer, or insurance carrier, is a company selling the insurance; the\ninsured, or policyholder, is the person or entity buying the insurance policy.\nThe amount to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage is called\nthe premium. Risk management, the practice of appraising and controlling risk,\nhas evolved as a discrete field of study and practice.\n\nThe transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively\nsmall loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's\npromise to compensate (indemnify) the insured in the case of a financial\n(personal) loss. The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy,\nwhich details the conditions and circumstances under which the insured will be\nfinancially compensated.\n","linknr":985,"url":"Insurance","recorded":1362484704,"links":119,"instances":["economics","coffeehouse_owner","accounting","uk","united_states","finance","economics","united_states","business","us_financial_products","resource_management","probability_theory","law","economics"],"pdf":["http://dhenriet.perso.egim-mrs.fr/gollier.pdf","http://baywood.metapress.com/index/1GU8EQN802J62RXK.pdf","http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/downloads/archive/arch167.pdf","http://fic.wharton.upenn.edu/fic/papers/95/9513.pdf","http://www.naic.org/documents/consumer_state_reg_brief.pdf","http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2011-F2.pdf","http://www.law.fsu.edu/Journals/lawreview/downloads/263/rand.pdf","http://www.ncoil.org/policy/Docs/2007/ILFStudy.pdf","http://people.hofstra.edu/Anoop_Rai/research/JORI70-1Campbell.pdf","http://www.genevaassociation.org/PDF/Geneva_papers_on_Risk_and_Insurance/GA2002_GP27(3)_Thomas.pdf","http://www.business.camden.rutgers.edu/FacultyStaff/research/schindler/Schindler%20(1994).pdf"],"categories":["Insurance|*","Financial
