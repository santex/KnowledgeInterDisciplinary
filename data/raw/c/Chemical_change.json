These processes are called chemical reactions and, in\ngeneral, are not reversible except by further chemical reactions. Some reactions\nproduce heat and are called exothermic reactions and others may require heat to\nenable the reaction to occur, which are called endothermic reactions.\nUnderstanding chemical changes is a major part of the science of chemistry.\n\nWhen chemical reactions occur, the atoms are rearranged and the reaction is\naccompanied by an energy change as new products are generated. An example of a\nchemical change is the reaction between sodium and water to produce sodium\nhydroxide and hydrogen. So much energy is released that the hydrogen gas\nreleased spontaneously burns in the air. This is an example of a chemical\nchange because the end products are chemically different from the substances\nbefore the reaction.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Chemical_change","recorded":1362666893,"links":18,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding|","Chemical properties"],"headings":["Types","Evidence of a chemical change","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["neutralization","chemistry"],["base","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"],["cracking","chemistry"]],"members":["salt","base","cracking","neutralization"],"related":["Chemical_synthesis","Chemical_decomposition","Chemical_reaction","Heat","Exothermic","Endothermic","Chemistry","Atom","Gibbs_free_energy","Sodium","Water","Sodium_hydroxide","Hydrogen","Chemical_reaction","Chemist","Inorganic_chemistry","Laboratory","Neutralization_(chemistry)","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Water","Salt_(chemistry)","Oxidisation","Combustion","Redox","Organic_chemistry","Carbon","Mineral_oil","Pharmaceutical","Paint","Detergent","Cosmetic","Fuel","Cracking_(chemistry)","Hydrocarbon","Oil_refinery","Gasoline","Fuel_oil","Methylation","Condensation_reaction","Polymerisation","Halogen","Protein","Enzyme","Hormones","Fungus","Bacteria","Photosynthesis","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Sugar","Oxygen","Plant","Digestion","Krebs_cycle","Protein","RNA","Iron","Energy","Exothermic","Endothermic","Heat","Light","Heat","Sound","Precipitate","Organic_matter"]}
