{"cursor":"13185","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Neural facilitation', also known as 'paired pulse facilitation' (PPF), is a\nphenomenon in neuroscience in which postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) (EPPs or\nEPSPs) evoked by an impulse are increased when that impulse closely follows a\nprior impulse. PPF is thus a form of short-term synaptic plasticity. The\nmechanisms underlying neural facilitation are exclusively pre-synaptic; broadly\nspeaking, PPF arises due to increased presynaptic Ca 2+ concentration\nleading to a greater release of neurotransmitter-containing synaptic\nvesicles. Neural facilitation may be involved in\nseveral neuronal tasks, including simple learning, information\nprocessing, and sound-source localization.\n","linknr":186,"url":"Neural_facilitation","recorded":1362890573,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neuroscience","Neurophysiology"],"headings":["Mechanisms","Relation to other forms of short-term synaptic plasticity","Relation to information transmission","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Neuroscience","End-plate_potential","Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential","Synaptic_plasticity","Synaptic_vesicle","Chemical_synapses","Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel","Action_potential","Synaptic_vesicles","Neurotransmitters","Synaptic_cleft","Presynaptic_terminal","Refractory_period","Depolarizing","Calyx_of_Held","Chelation","High-pass_filters","Low-pass_filters","Band-pass_filters","Neuromodulator","Sound_localization","Interaural_time_difference","Long-term_potentiation","Synaptic_plasticity","Neuroplasticity","Post-tetanic_potentiation","Sensitization","Synaptic_augmentation"]}
