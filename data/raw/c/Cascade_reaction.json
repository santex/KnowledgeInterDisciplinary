{"cursor":"5615","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'cascade reaction' or 'tandem reaction' or 'domino reaction' is a consecutive\nseries of intramolecular organic reactions which often proceed via highly\nreactive intermediates. It allows the organic synthesis of complex multinuclear\nmolecules from a single acyclic precursor. The substrate contains many\nfunctional groups that take part in chemical transformations one at the time.\nOften a functional group is generated in situ from the previous chemical\ntransformation. The definition includes the prerequisite intramolecular in order\nto distinguish this reaction type from a multi-component reaction. In this sense\nit differs from the definition of a biochemical cascade. The main advantages of\na cascade reaction in organic synthesis are that the reaction is often fast due\nto its intramolecular nature, the reaction is also clean, displays high atom\neconomy, does not involve workup and isolation of many intermediates, and adds\nmuch complexity in effectively one step.\n\nA cascade reaction is sometimes called a living reaction because it shares some\ncharacteristics with a living polymerization. In cascade reactions one can\nidentify an initiation site, a relay moiety and a termination moiety. Examples\nof cascade reactions are numerous (e.g. the Aldol-Tishchenko reaction) and\nespecially so in alkyne chemistry (the Banert cascade to name just one) or\npolyolefin polycycloisomerizations. Other alkyne coupling reactions are\nclassified based on common features such as type of compound synthesised, for\ninstance the spiro mode cascade:\n\n\n\n\nor the linear-fused mode cascade, through application of the\nintramolecular Heck reaction:\n\n\n\nor the zipper mode cascade.\n\n\n\nOther cascade reactions are included in Diels-Alder reactions, oxirane ring-\nopening reactions, Tandem Reaction Sequences Chris Borths\nMacMillan Group Meeting November 21, 2000 [http://www.its.caltech.edu/~dmacgrp/grpmtgs/2000/borths-\ntandem.pdf article] Xiaomin Jin Cook Group Feb. 11, '2005' [http://cook.chem.ndsu.nodak.edu/files/group-presentations/lit-2-11-05-\nJin.pdf Article] and PausonâKhand reactions.\n\nAn example of an oxirane cascade reaction is given by the synthesis of certain\npolyether ladder polymers:\n\n\nThis type of ladder compounds are found in marine lifeforms such as red tide.\nThe tri-epoxide is prepared from a triene through asymmetric Shi epoxidation and\noxone as primary oxidizing agent.
