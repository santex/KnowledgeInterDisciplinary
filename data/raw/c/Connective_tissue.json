{"cursor":"5774","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Connective tissue (CT)' is a kind of biological tissue that supports, connects,\nor separates different types of tissues and organs of the body. It is one of the\nfour general classes of biological tissuesâthe others of which are epithelial,\nmuscular, and nervous tissues.\n\nAll CT has three main components: cells, fibers, and extracellular matrices, all\nimmersed in the body fluids.\n\nConnective tissue can be broadly subdivided into connective tissue proper,\nspecial connective tissue, and series of other, less classifiable types of\nconnective tissues. Connective tissue proper consists of loose\nconnective tissue and dense connective tissue (which is further subdivided into\ndense regular and dense irregular connective tissues.) Special\nconnective tissue consists of reticular connective tissue, adipose tissue,\ncartilage, bone, and blood. Other kinds of connective tissues include\nfibrous, elastic, and lymphoid connective tissues.\n\nFibroblasts are the cells responsible for the production of some CT.\n\nType-I collagen, is present in many forms of connective tissue, and makes up\nabout 25% of the total protein content of the mammalian body.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Connective_tissue","recorded":1362544936,"links":65,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Connective tissue"],"headings":["Functions of connective tissue","Characteristics of connective tissue and fiber types","Disorders of connective tissue","Staining of connective tissue","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"]],"members":["tissue"],"related":["Tissue_(biology)","Epithelium","Muscle_tissue","Nervous_tissue","Connective_tissue_proper","Connective_tissue_proper","Loose_connective_tissue","Dense_connective_tissue","Dense_regular_connective_tissue","Dense_irregular_connective_tissue","Reticular_connective_tissue","Adipose_tissue","Cartilage","Bone","Blood","Fibroblasts","Type-I_collagen","Fiber","Collagen","Elastic_fiber","Reticular_fiber","Sarcoma","Neoplastic","Hemangiopericytoma","Neoplastic","Van_Gieson's","Masson's_trichrome","Mallory's_Aniline_Blue","Azocarmine","Krajian's_Aniline_Blue","Eosin","Fascia","Myofascial_meridians"]}
