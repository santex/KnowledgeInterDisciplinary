{"cursor":"13573","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)', or simply 'metabolic equivalent', is a\nphysiological measure expressing the energy cost of physical activities and is\ndefined as the ratio of metabolic rate (and therefore the rate of energy\nconsumption) during a specific physical activity to a reference metabolic rate,\nset by convention to 3.5 ml O 2Â·kg â1 Â·min â1 or\nequivalently:\n\n\\text{1 MET}\\ \\equiv\\ 1 \\dfrac\\text{kcal}{\\text{kg}*{h}}\\ \\equiv\\ 4.184\n\\dfrac\\text{kJ}{\\text{kg}*{h}}\n\n1 MET is also defined as 58.2 W/m 2 (18.4 Btu/hÂ·ft 2), which\nis equal to the energy produced per unit surface area of an average person\nseated at rest. The surface area of an average person is 1.8 m 2 (19\nft 2). Metabolic rate is usually expressed in terms of unit area of\nthe total body surface (ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55,\nThermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy ).\n\nOriginally, 1 MET was considered as the Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) obtained\nduring quiet sitting. MET values of\nactivities range from 0.9 (sleeping) to 23 (running at 22.5 km/h or a 4:17\nmile pace).\n\nAlthough the RMR of any person may deviate from the reference value, MET can be thought of as an index\nof the intensity of activities: for example, an activity with a MET value of 2,\nsuch as walking at a slow pace (e.g., 3 km/h) would require twice the\nenergy that an average person consumes at rest (e.g., sitting quietly).\n\nMET is used as a means of expressing the intensity and energy expenditure of\nactivities in a way comparable among persons of different weight. Actual energy\nexpenditure (e.g., in calories or joules) during an activity depends on the\nperson's body mass; therefore, the energy cost of the same activity will be\ndifferent for persons of different weight. However, since the RMR is also\ndependent on body mass in a similar way, it is assumed that the ratio of this\nenergy cost to the RMR of each person will remain more or less stable for the\nspecific activity and thus independent of each person's weight.\n\nThe 1 MET reference value of 1 kcalÂ·kg â1 Â·h â1 , is used\nby convention and refers to a typical metabolism at rest of an \"average\"\nindividual. It must not be confused or misused as an approximation of Basal\nMetabolic Rate (BMR), which is the minimum metabolic rate obtained under\nspecified conditions. This is illustrated by the fact that sleeping has a\nMET of 0.9, while an individual's normal sleeping metabolism may be greater\nthan the BMR.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Metabolic_equivalent","recorded":1362485008,"links":18,"instances":["social_sciences"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Exercise physiology"],"headings":["''Compendium of Physical Activities''","Scope of usage of the MET concept","See also","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/3/7/637fdf831df0f51fd5c20ffc59600777.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["scale","social_sciences"]],"members":["scale"],"related":["Physiological","Exercise","Resting_Metabolic_Rate","Scale_(social_sciences)","Basal_Metabolic_Rate","Body_mass_index","Anthropogenic_metabolism","Basal_metabolic_rate","Calorimetry"]}
