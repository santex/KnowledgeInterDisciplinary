{"cursor":"18047","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'germ cell' is any biological cell that gives rise to the gametes of an\norganism that reproduces sexually. In many animals, the germ cells originate\nnear the gut of an embryo and migrate to the developing gonads. There, they\nundergo cell division of two types, mitosis and meiosis, followed by cellular\ndifferentiation into mature gametes, either eggs or sperm. Unlike animals,\nplants do not have germ cells set aside in early development. Instead, germ\ncells can come from somatic cells in the adult (such as the floral meristem of\nflowering plants).\n","linknr":443,"url":"Germ_cell","recorded":1362483515,"links":25,"instances":["biology","biology","embryo","biology","zoology"],"pdf":["http://stemcells.alphamedpress.org/cgi/reprint/24/2/212.pdf","http://stemcells.alphamedpress.org/cgi/reprint/24/2/212.pdf"],"categories":["Germ cells|"],"headings":["Introduction","Specification","Migration","Gametogenesis","Diseases","Induced differentiation from stem cells","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["gut","zoology"],["egg","biology"],["cleavage","embryo"],["egg","biology"],["morphology","biology"]],"members":["cell","morphology","cleavage","egg","gut"],"related":["Cell_(biology)","Gamete","Sexual_reproduction","Gut_(zoology)","Embryo","Gonad","Cell_division","Mitosis","Meiosis","Cellular_differentiation","Egg_(biology)","Sperm","Plant","Somatic_cell","Meristem","Eukaryote","Meiosis","Mitosis","Somatic_cell","Cleavage_(embryo)","Epiblast","Gastrulation","Bird","Mammal","Stem_cells","Pluripotent","Embryo","MRNA","Totipotent","PRDM1","Model_organism","Mesoderm","Endoderm","Chemorepellent","Chemoattractant","Vegetal_pole","Blastomere","Blastocoel","Gastrulation","Mesentery","Fibronectin","Epiblast","Yolk_sac","Hindgut","Fibronectin","Reptile","Bird","Hypoblast","Gonocyte","Blood_vessel","Circulatory_system","Gonadal_ridge","Cell_adhesion","Endothelium","Chemoattractant","Y_chromosome","Somatic_cell","Sertoli_cells","Sperm","Egg_(biology)","Testes","Ovary","Sex_chromosome","Gametogenesis","Diploid","Haploid","Species","Oogenesis","Spermatogenesis","Meiosis","Morphology_(biology)","Spermatid","Asymmetrical","Polar_bodies","Zona_pellucida","Cortical_granules","Follicular_granulosa_cell","Gap_junction","Ovulation","Pituitary_gland","Follicle-stimulating_hormone","Thecal_cell","Estrogen","Luteinizing_hormone","Pituitary_gland","Egg_yolk","Glycogen","Lipid","Ribosome","MRNA","Chromosome","Lampbrush_chromosome","Haploid","Puberty","Mass","Gene","Blood","Accessory_cell","Nurse_cell","Gap_junction","Mammal","Spermatogenesis","Seminiferous_tubules","Seminiferous_tubule","Basal_lamina","Acrosome","Flagellum","Cytokinesis","Syncytium","Genome","Y_chromosome","X_chromosome","Germ_cell_tumor","Cancer","Gonad","Abdomen","Pelvis","Mediastinum","Brain","Benign_tumor","Malignant_tumor","Human_embryonic_stem_cell","Porcine_ovarian_fibroblast","Gene_expression"]}
