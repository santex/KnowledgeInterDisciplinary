'Anti-\nicing' is understood to be the application of chemicals that not only de-ice,\nbut also remain on a surface and continue to delay the reformation of ice for\na certain period of time, or prevent adhesion of ice to make mechanical\nremoval easier.\n","linknr":261,"url":"De-icer","recorded":1362481589,"links":30,"instances":["force","georgia","chemistry","meteorology","aircraft"],"pdf":["http://www.livingonearth.org/images/090220/Salt_Soils_Urban_Ecosystems_2008.pdf","http://www.aopa.org/asf/publications/sa11.pdf"],"categories":["Aviation safety","Aviation risks","Road transport","Chemical processes","Ice in transportation","NASA spin-off technologies"],"headings":["Methods","List of de-icers","Environmental impact","Aircraft-related use","Fluid types","Pneumatic systems","Electric systems","Air bleed systems","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Aeroflot_Airbus_A330-200_de-icing_Pereslavtsev.jpg/300px-Aeroflot_Airbus_A330-200_de-icing_Pereslavtsev.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/De-icing_at_SLC.jpg/220px-De-icing_at_SLC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/Deicing_Copenhagen_Airport.JPG/300px-Deicing_Copenhagen_Airport.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/B-17_on_bomb_run.jpg/300px-B-17_on_bomb_run.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dissolution","chemistry"],["precipitation","meteorology"],["lift","force"],["flint_river","georgia"],["propeller","aircraft"]],"members":["lift","flint_river","dissolution","precipitation","propeller"],"related":["Airbus_A330","Sheremetyevo_International_Airport","Snow","Ice","Frost","Heat","Freezing_point","Salt","Brine","Alcohol","Glycol","Viscous","Road","Salt","Snowplow","Dump_truck","Sand","Gravel","Sodium_chloride","Cost","Brine","Corrosion","Rust","Steel","Rebar","Calcium_chloride","Magnesium_chloride","Exothermic_reaction","Sidewalk","Sugar_beet","Distillation","Ethanol","Exothermic","Dissolution_(chemistry)","Chemical_formula","Inorganic","Salts","Sodium_Chloride","Table_salt","Magnesium_Chloride","Calcium_Chloride","Potassium_Chloride","Organic_compound","Calcium_Magnesium_Acetate","Potassium_acetate","Potassium_formate","Sodium_formate","Calcium_formate","Urea","Sodium_chloride","Alcohols","Diols","Polyols","Antifreeze","Methanol","Ethylene_Glycol","Propylene_Glycol","Glycerol","Sodium_chloride","Calcium_chloride","Soils","Cations","Organisms","Plants","Propylene_glycol","Surface_runoff","Waterway","Freezing","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Lift_(force)","Aviation_accidents_and_incidents","Airport","Temperature","Supercooled","De-icing_fluid","Propylene_glycol","Ethylene_glycol","Antifreeze","Automobile","Containment","Snow","Atlanta","Contamination","Flint_River_(Georgia)","Hartsfield-Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport","De-icing_fluid","Newtonian_fluid","Non-Newtonian_fluid","Deicing_boot","Resistor","Propeller_(aircraft)","Helicopter","NASA","Atmospheric_icing","Ice_protection_system","Pitot_tube","Pitot-static_system"]}
