It\nis found in all eukaryotic cells (the only known exception being nematode\nsperm), where it may be present at concentrations of over 100 Î¼M. Actin is\nroughly 42-kDa in size and it is the monomeric subunit of two types of\nfilaments in cells: microfilaments, one of the three major components of the\ncytoskeleton, and thin filaments, part of the contractile apparatus in muscle\ncells. It can be present as either a free monomer called 'G-actin' or as part\nof a linear polymer 'microfilament' called 'F-actin' both of which are\nessential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction\nof cells during cell division.\n\nThus, actin participates in many important cellular processes, including muscle\ncontraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle\nmovement, cell signalling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell\njunctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and\nintimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes. In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms,\nalpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle\ntissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and\ngamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and\nas mediators of internal cell motility.\n\nA cellâs ability to dynamically form microfilaments provides the scaffolding\nthat allows it to rapidly remodel itself in response to its environment or to\nthe organismâs internal signals, for example, to increase cell membrane\nabsorption or increase cell adhesion in order to form cell tissue. Other enzymes\nor organelles such as cillia can be anchored to this scaffolding in order to\ncontrol the deformation of the external cell membrane, which allows endocytosis\nand cytokinesis. It can also produce movement either by itself or with the help\nof molecular motors. Actin therefore contributes to processes such as the\nintracellular transport of vesicles and organelles as well as muscular\ncontraction and cellular migration. It therefore plays an important role in\nembryogenesis, the healing of wounds and the invasivity of cancer cells. The\nevolutionary origin of actin can be traced to prokaryotic cells, which have\nequivalent proteins. Lastly, actin plays an important role in the control of\ngene expression.\n\nA large number of illnesses and diseases are caused by mutations in alleles of\nthe genes that regulate the production of actin or of its associated proteins.\nThe production of actin is also key to the process of infection by some\npathogenic microorganisms. Mutations in the different genes that regulate actin\nproduction in humans can cause muscular diseases, variations in the size and\nfunction of the heart as well as deafness. The make-up of the cytoskeleton is\nalso related to the pathogenicity of intracellular bacteria and viruses,\nparticularly in the processes related to evading the actions of the immune\nsystem.\n","linknr":2573,"url":"Actin","recorded":1362484373,"links":77,"instances":["chemistry","genetics","biology","biology","genetics","biology","biochemistry","biology","unit","chemistry","chemistry","protein","biology","biology","protein","biology","genetics","genetics","biology","genetics","biochemistry","biology","human","heart"],"pdf":["http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/112/11/1697.pdf","http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/112/11/1697.pdf","http://www.animalscience.com/uploads/additionalFiles/QualityOfPoultryMeat/27.pdf","http://www.animalscience.com/uploads/additionalFiles/QualityOfPoultryMeat/27.pdf"],"categories":["Cytoskeleton","Structural
