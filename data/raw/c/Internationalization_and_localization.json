{"cursor":"13532","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n.]]\n\nIn computing, 'internationalization and localization' ([[American and British\nEnglish spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|other correct\nspellings are]]'internationalisation and localisation') are means of adapting\ncomputer software to different languages, regional differences and technical\nrequirements of a target market. Internationalization is the process of\ndesigning a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages\nand regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting\ninternationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-\nspecific components and translating text.\n\nThe terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms 'i18n' (where 18 stands\nfor the number of letters between the first i and last n in\ninternationalization, a usage coined at DEC in the 1970s or 80s) and\n'L10n' respectively, due to the length of the words. The capital L in L10n helps\nto distinguish it from the lowercase i in i18n.\n\nSome companies, like IBM and Sun Microsystems, use the term \"globalization\" for\nthe combination of internationalization and\nlocalization.

World-Readiness is a developer\ntask, which enables a product to be used with multiple scripts and cultures\n(globalization) and separating user interface resources in a localizable format\n(localizability, abbreviated to 'L12y').
