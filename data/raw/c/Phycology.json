{"cursor":"7717","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Phycology' (from Greek , phykos, \"seaweed\"; and , [[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]])\nis the scientific study of algae. Phycology is a branch of life science and\noften is regarded as a subdiscipline of botany.\n\nAlgae are important plants as primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. Most\nalgae are eukaryotic, photosynthetic organisms that live in a wet environment.\nThey are distinguished from the higher plants by a lack of true roots, stems or\nleaves. Many species are single-celled and microscopic (including phytoplankton\nand other microalgae); many others are multicellular to one degree or another,\nsome of these growing to large size (for example, seaweeds such as kelp and\n[[Sargassum]]).\n\nPhycology includes the study of prokaryotic forms known as blue-green algae or\ncyanobacteria. A number of microscopic algae also occur as symbionts in lichens.\n\nA 'phycologist' is a person who studies algae as described above.\n","linknr":202,"url":"Phycology","recorded":1362505635,"links":50,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/1579/01/A_preliminary_check-list_of_British_marine_algae.pdf"],"categories":["Algae","Marine botany"],"headings":["History of phycology","Notable phycologists","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Kelp_In_Freycinet_Tasmania.jpg/250px-Kelp_In_Freycinet_Tasmania.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ancient_Greek","Alga","Botany","Plants","Primary_production","Ecosystem","Eukaryote","Photosynthesis","Root","Leaf","Phytoplankton","Microalgae","Multicellular","Seaweeds","Kelp","Prokaryote","Cyanobacteria","Lichens","Algae","Ecklonia_maxima","Pehr_Osbeck","Dawson_Turner","Carl_Adolph_Agardh","Jean_Vincent_Félix_Lamouroux","William_Henry_Harvey","Identification_key","Jean_Pierre_Étienne_Vaucher","Isogamy","Felix_Eugen_Fritsch","Elsie_M._Burrows","Kathleen_Mary_Drew-Baker","Eifion_Jones","Mary_Parke_","Algaculture","Algae_fuel","History_of_phycology","Phycological_Society_of_America"]}
