{"cursor":"22399","size":15,"audio":[],"cat":[],"tmpl":[],"currentlang":"en","linknr":329,"url":"Semiconductor_device","article":"\n\n'Semiconductor devices' are electronic components that exploit the electronic\nproperties of semiconductor materials, principally silicon, germanium, and\ngallium arsenide, as well as organic semiconductors. Semiconductor devices have\nreplaced thermionic devices (vacuum tubes) in most applications. They use\nelectronic conduction in the solid state as opposed to the gaseous state or\nthermionic emission in a high vacuum.\n\nSemiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as\n[[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), which consist of a numberâfrom a few (as low as\ntwo) to billionsâof devices manufactured and interconnected on a single\nsemiconductor substrate, or wafer.\n\nSemiconductor materials are so useful because their behavior can be easily\nmanipulated by the addition of impurities, known as doping. Semiconductor\nconductivity can be controlled by introduction of an electric or magnetic field,\nby exposure to light or heat, or by mechanical deformation of a doped\nmonocrystalline grid; thus, semiconductors can make excellent sensors. Current\nconduction in a semiconductor occurs via mobile or \"free\" [[electrons]] and\n[[Electron hole|holes]], collectively known as [[charge carrier]]s. Doping a\nsemiconductor such as silicon with a small amount of impurity atoms, such as\nphosphorus or boron, greatly increases the number of free electrons or holes\nwithin the semiconductor. When a doped semiconductor contains excess holes it is\ncalled \"p-type\", and when it contains excess free electrons it is known as \"n-\ntype\", where p (positive for holes) or n (negative for electrons) is the sign of\nthe charge of the majority mobile charge carriers. The semiconductor material\nused in devices is doped under highly controlled conditions in a fabrication\nfacility, or [[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]], to precisely control the location and\nconcentration of p- and n-type dopants. The junctions which form where n-type\nand p-type semiconductors join together are called p-n junctions.\n","recorded":1362124036,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"330","instances":["semiconductors","semiconductor","semiconductors","electronics","crystal","electronics","engineering","1886","electrical","electronics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semiconductor
