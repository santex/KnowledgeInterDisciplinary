{"cursor":"5363","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Defect}}\n\nIn geometry, the ('angular') 'defect' (or 'deficit' or 'deficiency') means the\nfailure of some angles to add up to the expected amount of 360Â° or 180Â°, when\nsuch angles in the plane would. The opposite notion is the excess.\n\nClassically the defect arises in two ways:\n* the defect of a vertex of a polyhedron;\n* the defect of a hyperbolic triangle; and the excess arises in one way:\n* the excess of a spherical triangle. In the plane, angles about a point add up\n  to 360Â°, while interior angles in a triangle add up to 180Â° (equivalently,\n  exterior angles add up to 360Â°). However, on a convex polyhedron the angles at\n  a vertex on average add up to less than 360Â°, on a spherical triangle the\n  interior angles always add up to more than 180Â° (the exterior angles add up to\n  less than 360Â°), and the angles in a hyperbolic triangle always add up to less\n  than 180Â° (the exterior angles add up to more than 360Â°).\n\nIn modern terms, the defect at a vertex or over a triangle (with a minus) is\nprecisely the curvature at that point or the total (integrated) over the\ntriangle, as established by the GaussâBonnet theorem.\n","linknr":143,"url":"Angular_deficiency","recorded":1362555003,"links":18,"instances":["mathematics","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polyhedra","Hyperbolic geometry"],"headings":["Defect of a vertex","Examples","Descartes' theorem","A potential error","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/a/d/eadbf26e3cb9eae366fbb8c8593ac9e9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/9/ff9aea6222506516a7cbc3669bd5b2d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/5/885521cce4634bd1625c23d29f205d9d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/9/ff9aea6222506516a7cbc3669bd5b2d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/1/571987b3274a28935f1ba3052ebe0462.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/9/ff9aea6222506516a7cbc3669bd5b2d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/0/5004c837442254db90fad1c4a549a052.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/9/ff9aea6222506516a7cbc3669bd5b2d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/a/eba78b97e947ce87f503ef5afb77bfad.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/f/9/ff9aea6222506516a7cbc3669bd5b2d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a9/Polydera_with_positive_defects_convex.svg/180px-Polydera_with_positive_defects_convex.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Polydera_with_positive_defects_concave.svg/180px-Polydera_with_positive_defects_concave.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","geometry"],["peak","mathematics"]],"members":["peak","cell"],"related":["Geometry","Angle_excess","Hyperbolic_triangle","Spherical_triangle","Internal_and_external_angle","Gauss–Bonnet_theorem","Polyhedron","Dihedral_angle","Cell_(geometry)","Peak_(mathematics)","Oxford_English_Dictionary","Dodecahedron","Pentagon","Platonic_solid","Tetrahedron","Octahedron","Cube","Icosahedron","Dodecahedron","Homeomorphism","René_Descartes","Euler_characteristic","Gauss–Bonnet_theorem","Gaussian_curvature","Cube","Square_pyramid","Elongated_square_pyramid","Saddle_point","Local_maximum"]}
