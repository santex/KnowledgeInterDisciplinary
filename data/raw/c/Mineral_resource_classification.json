There are several classification\nschemes worldwide, however the Canadian CIM classification (see NI 43-101), the\nAustralasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code), the South African\nCode for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (SAMREC) and the âchessboardâ classification scheme of mineral deposits\nby H.
