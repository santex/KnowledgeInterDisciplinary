{"cursor":"10307","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Politically exposed person' ('PEP') is a term that describes a person who has\nbeen entrusted with a prominent public function, or an individual who is closely\nrelated to such a person. The terms PEP, Politically Exposed Person and Senior\nForeign Political Figure are often used interchangeably, particularly in\ninternational fora. Although the term PEP is not used in FinCENâs regulations, http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf it is to a\ngreat extent similar to the definition of 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as\ndefined by section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act and it is a term recognised (and\ndefined) by the Wolfsberg Group of eleven global banks. http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/faq-\npersons.html Neither the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering\n(FATF) definition nor the USA PATRIOT Act definition of this term are intended\nto include middle-ranking or more junior individuals in the categories listed in\nthe below definition or officials of local governments. As of February 2012, the\nFATF definition of a PEP was revised to include domestic PEPs. Although the true\nnumber of PEPs globally is not known, one database of PEPs contains over 1.2\nmillion unique profiles for PEPs. http://www.worldcompliance.com/en/content/global-pep-\nlist.aspx\n\nThe term '[[foreign official|Foreign Official]]' is used by enforcement agencies\nrelating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, but this term is\nused in all industries, not just by financial institutions, and is referenced in\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States.\n\nBy virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold, a PEP\ngenerally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in bribery and\ncorruption. Most financial institutions view such clients as potential\ncompliance risks and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within\nthis category.\n\nThe process of screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of\naccount opening, called initial due diligence, and screening of accounts\nperiodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence. The process of due\ndiligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires screening against\na reputable database of known PEPs, usually close to 1 million profiles,\nagainst the names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos\nof clients.\n\nHeavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions such as Riggs Bank for\nconducting business with PEPs without following adequate Know Your Customer\nprocedures and enhanced due diligence processes. PEP-specific compliance\nlegislation underlines the link between corrupt politicians, money laundering\nand the financing of terrorism. Since September 11, 2001, more than 100\ncountries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, with\nthe fight against political corruption playing a fundamental role. Despite\nattempts at regulation, certain political leaders like Muammar Gaddafi and Hosni\nMubarak have made news for having frozen assets located in US banks that did not\nfollow these processes for these individuals.\n\nThe designation âPolitically Exposed Personâ dates back to the late 1990s in\nwhat was known as the âAbacha Affair.â Sani Abacha was a Nigerian dictator who\norganized (with his family members and associates) a network of massive theft of\nassets from the government of Nigeria. It is believed that several billion\ndollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the\nUnited Kingdom and Switzerland. http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html\n\nIn 2001, in an effort to recover the money, the Nigerian Government that\nsucceeded the Abacha Regime lodged complaints with several European agencies,\nincluding the Federal Office of Police (FOP) of Switzerland which, in turn,\ninvestigated close to sixty Swiss banks. In this investigation, the concept of\nâPolitically Exposed Personâ emerged, which was later included in the 2003\nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption.
