{"cursor":"11142","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'construct state' or 'status constructus' is a noun form occurring in Afro-\nAsiatic languages. It is particularly common in Semitic languages (such as\nArabic, Hebrew, and Syriac), in the Berber languages, and in the extinct\nEgyptian language. Forms analogous to the construct state are also found in some\nother languages, such as Dholuo.\n\nIn Semitic languages, nouns are placed in the construct state when they are\nsemantically definite and modified by another noun in a genitive construction.\nNote that this differs from the genitive case of European languages in that it\nis the head (modified) noun rather than the dependent (modifying) noun that is\nmarked. However, in Semitic languages with grammatical case (e.g. Classical\nArabic), the modifying noun in a genitive construction is placed in the genitive\ncase, in addition to marking the head noun with the construct state.\n\nIn some non-Semitic languages, the construct state has various additional\nfunctions besides marking the head noun of a genitive construction.\n\nDepending on the particular language, the construct state of a noun is indicated\nby various phonological properties (e.g. a different suffix, different vowels or\ndifferent stress) and/or morphological properties (such as inability to take a\ndefinite article).\n","linknr":168,"url":"Status_constructus","recorded":1362477363,"links":23,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","ʼiḍāfah","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semitic linguistics"],"headings":["Semitic languages","Arabic","Aramaic","Berber","Dholuo","Hebrew","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","linguistics"],["head","linguistics"],["arabic_grammar#genitive_construction","ʼiḍāfah"],["arabic_grammar#formation_of_derived_stems","\"forms\""],["arabic_grammar#hollow","second-weak_verbs"],["article","grammar#definite_article"],["cohesion","linguistics"],["compound","linguistics"]],"members":["head","compound","morphology","cohesion","article"],"related":["Noun","Morphology_(linguistics)","Afro-Asiatic_languages","Semitic_languages","Arabic_language","Hebrew_language","Syriac_language","Berber_languages","Egyptian_language","Dholuo_language","Semitic_languages","Definiteness","Genitive_construction","Genitive_case","Head_(linguistics)","Grammatical_case","Classical_Arabic","Genitive_case","Genitive_construction","Definite_article","Biblical_Hebrew","Biblical_Hebrew","Varieties_of_Arabic","Modern_Hebrew","Moroccan_Arabic","Falafel","Arabic_grammar","Genitive_case","Definiteness","Classical_Arabic","Egyptian_Arabic","Classical_Arabic","Nunation","Pausa","Varieties_of_Arabic","Varieties_of_Arabic","Gulf_Arabic","Egyptian_Arabic","Moroccan_Arabic","Periphrasis","Syriac","Peshitta","Berber_language","Verb–subject–object","Dholuo_language","Luo_languages","Apophony","Hebrew_grammar","Cohesion_(linguistics)","Hebrew_grammar","Compound_(linguistics)","Definiteness"]}
