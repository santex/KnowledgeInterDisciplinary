{"cursor":"14606","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'bandwagon effect' is a well documented form of groupthink in behavioral\nscience and has many applications. The general rule is that conduct or beliefs\nspread among people, as fads and trends clearly do, with \"the probability of any\nindividual adopting it increasing with the proportion who have already done\nso\". As more people come to believe in something, others also \"hop on\nthe bandwagon\" regardless of the underlying evidence. The tendency to follow the\nactions or beliefs of others can occur because individuals directly prefer to\nconform, or because individuals derive information from others. Both\nexplanations have been used for evidence of conformity in psychological\nexperiments. For example, social pressure has been used to explain Asch's\nconformity experiments, and information has been used to explain\nSherif's autokinetic experiment.\n","linknr":441,"url":"Bandwagon_effect","recorded":1362480270,"links":34,"instances":["competition"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Behavioral and social facets of systemic risk","Cognitive biases","Conformity","Crowd psychology","Economics effects","Political metaphors","Propaganda techniques","Revolution terminology"],"headings":["The concept","Origin of the phrase","Use in politics","Use in microeconomics","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Logo_sociology.svg/28px-Logo_sociology.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F005102-0011%2C_Lager_Friedland%2C_Kriegsheimkehrer%2C_Schreibkraft.jpg/75px-Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F005102-0011%2C_Lager_Friedland%2C_Kriegsheimkehrer%2C_Schreibkraft.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["underdog","competition"]],"members":["underdog"],"related":["Groupthink","Fads_and_trends","Conformity","Asch_conformity_experiments","Autokinetic_effect","Rationality","Information_cascades","Dan_Rice","William_Jennings_Bryan","Informational_cascade","NBC_News","Ronald_Reagan","The_Big_Mo","Underdog_(competition)","Bill_Clinton","Microeconomics","Supply_and_demand","Appeal_to_the_majority","Bandwagoning","Collective_behavior","Collective_consciousness","Collective_effervescence","Communal_reinforcement","Crowd_manipulation","Crowd_psychology","Fan_loyalty","Group_behaviour","Groupthink","Herd_behavior","Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses","List_of_cognitive_biases","Meme","Mitl√§ufer","Ochlocracy","Peer_pressure","Revolutionary_wave","Sheeple","Snowball_effect","Social_comparison_theory","Spiral_of_silence"]}
