Pictured are several denominations of\nthe euro.]]\n\n\nA 'currency' (from Middle English curraunt, meaning in circulation) in the most\nspecific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or\ncirculation, as a medium of exchange, especially circulating paper money. This\nuse is synonymous with banknotes, or (sometimes) with banknotes plus coins,\nmeaning the physical tokens used for money by a\ngovernment. [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/currency See definition\n1]\n\nA much more general use of the word 'currency' is anything that is used in any\ncircumstances, as a medium of exchange. In this use, \"currency\" is a synonym for\nthe concept of money. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/currency\nDefinition as medium of exchange]\n\nA definition of intermediate generality is that a 'currency' is a system of\nmoney (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. http://www.in-\nvestopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp#axzz2CqfsX9BD Under this definition,\nBritish pounds, U.S. dollars, and European euros are different types of\ncurrency, or currencies. Currencies in this definition need not be physical\nobjects, but as stores of value are subject to trading between nations in\nforeign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different\ncurrencies.

Currencies in the sense used by foreign exchange\nmarkets, are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of\nacceptance.\n\nThe former definitions of the term \"currency\" are discussed in their respective\nsynonymous articles banknote, coin, and money. The latter definition, pertaining\nto the currency systems of nations, is the topic of this
