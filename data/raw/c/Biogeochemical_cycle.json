A cycle is a series of change which comes\nback to the starting point and which can be repeated. Prentice Hall Biology. [http://www.lenntech.com/matter-\ncycles.htm Matter cycles at Lenntech.]\n\nThe term âbiogeochemicalâ tells us that biological, geological and chemical\nfactors are all involved. The circulation of chemical nutrients like carbon,\noxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and water etc. through the biological and\nphysical world are known as biogeochemical cycles. In effect, the element is\nrecycled, although in some cycles there may be places (called reservoirs) where\nthe element is accumulated or held for a long period of time (such as an ocean\nor lake for water).\n\nWater, for example, is always recycled through the water cycle, as shown in the\ndiagram. The water undergoes evaporation, condensation, and precipitation,\nfalling back to Earth clean and fresh. Elements, chemical compounds, and other\nforms of matter are passed from one organism to another and from one part of the\nbiosphere to another through the biogeochemical cycles.\n","linknr":508,"url":"Biogeochemical_cycle","recorded":1362372956,"links":55,"instances":["ecological","soil_study","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://neespi.org/science/NEESPI_SP_chapters/SP_Chapter_3.2.pdf"],"categories":["Biogeochemical cycle","Geochemistry","Biogeography"],"headings":["Systems","Reservoirs","Important cycles","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Water_cycle.png/320px-Water_cycle.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Plagiomnium_affine_laminazellen.jpeg/250px-Plagiomnium_affine_laminazellen.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Coal_anthracite.jpg/220px-Coal_anthracite.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg/180px-Nitrogen_Cycle.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Water_cycle.png/180px-Water_cycle.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Carbon_cycle-cute_diagram.svg/180px-Carbon_cycle-cute_diagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Oxygen_cycle.svg/180px-Oxygen_cycle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/eb/Phoscycle-EPA.jpg/180px-Phoscycle-EPA.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/DirkvdM_rocks.jpg/32px-DirkvdM_rocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["pedology","soil_study"],["recycling","ecological"]],"members":["recycling","pedology","precipitation"],"related":["Geography","Earth_science","Chemical_element","Molecule","Biosphere","Lithosphere","Atmosphere","Hydrosphere","Earth","Evaporation","Condensation","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Photosynthesis","Plant_cell","Eukaryote","Hydrosphere","Lithosphere","Atmosphere","Carbon","Nitrogen","Oxygen","Phosphorus","Sulfur","Trophic_level","Food_energy","Chemical_reaction","Deep_sea","Hydrogen_sulfide","Hydrothermal_vent","Giant_tube_worm","Sulfur_cycle","Oxidation","Redox","Sulfite","Sulfate","Coal","Carbon","Carbon_cycle","Nitrogen_cycle","Oxygen_cycle","Phosphorus_cycle","Sulfur_cycle","Water_cycle","Rock_cycle","Mercury_cycle","Atrazine","Ecology","Atmospheric_sciences","Geology","Pedology_(soil_study)","Nitrogen_cycle","Water_cycle","Carbon_cycle","Oxygen_cycle","Phosphorus_cycle","Biodiversity","Bioregion","Earth_Science","Ecology","Ecosystem","Soil_zoology","GEOTRACES","Natural_environment","Nature","Recycling_(ecological)","Sulfur_Cycle"]}
