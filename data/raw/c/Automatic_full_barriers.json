It has a gate mechanism on both sides of the tracks for both\ndirections of automotive traffic. The exit gates blocking the road leading away\nfrom the tracks in this application are equipped with a delay, and begin their\ndescent to their horizontal position several seconds after the entrance gates\ndo, so as to avoid trapping highway vehicles on the crossing. Four-quadrant\ngates are safer than two-quadrant gates because they prevent drivers from\nillegally driving their vehicles around lowered gates to try to beat a train.\n\nIn the UK, such crossings are categorised as 'Manually Controlled Barriers'\n(MCB) because they are always manually controlled, usually from a signal box.\nSome are known as MCB-CCTV level crossings, because they are supervised by video\nlink to the signal box from which they are remotely controlled.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Automatic_full_barriers","recorded":1362890057,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Level crossings","Safety","Rail infrastructure","Road infrastructure","Street furniture"],"headings":["Automatic full barriers","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Level_crossing_-_Chertsey_-_England_-_270404.jpg/250px-Level_crossing_-_Chertsey_-_England_-_270404.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/25_railtransportation.svg/19px-25_railtransportation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Autoroute_icone.svg/30px-Autoroute_icone.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Boom_barrier","Grade_crossing","Rail_track","Train","Railway","Level_crossing","Pedestrian"]}
