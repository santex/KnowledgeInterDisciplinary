A notable recorded example is Charlie Parker's solo break at the\nbeginning of his solo on \"A Night in Tunisia\".\n\nIn DJ parlance, a break is where all elements of a song (e.g., pads, basslines,\nvocals), except for percussion, disappear for a time. This is distinguished from\na 'breakdown', a section where the composition is deliberately deconstructed to\nminimal elements (usually the percussion or rhythm section with the vocal re-\nintroduced over the minimal backing), all other parts having been gradually or\nsuddenly cut out. Brewster, Bill and Broughton, Frank (2003). How\nto DJ Right: The Art and Science of Playing Records, p. 79. New York: Grove\nPress. ISBN 0-8021-3995-7. The distinction between breaks and breakdowns\nmay be described as, \"Breaks are for the drummer; breakdowns are for hands in\nthe air\".\n\nIn hip hop and electronica, a short break is also known as a \"cut\", and the\nreintroduction of the full bass line and drums is known as a \"drop\", which is\nsometimes accented by cutting off everything, even the percussion.\n","linknr":355,"url":"Break_(music)","recorded":1362551844,"links":26,"instances":["instrumental","dance","band","musicologist","music","group","band","music","music","music","music","musician","dancer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Breaks|*","Musical techniques"],"headings":["Break","Break beat (element of music)","Breakbeat (genre of music)","Breakdown","Notable","See also","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/FClef.svg/40px-FClef.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/GClef.svg/10px-GClef.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["section","music"],["pad","music#synth_pad"],["section","music"],["drop","music"],["peter_van_der_merwe","musicologist"],["sampling","music"],["sampling","music"],["soul","music"],["crazy_legs","dancer"],["bridge","music"],["skank","dance"],["whitechapel","band"],["carnifex","band"],["apache","instrumental"],["public_enemy","group"],["bob_james","musician"]],"members":["apache","skank","carnifex","peter_van_der_merwe","drop","public_enemy","whitechapel","section","bridge","soul","sampling","pad","bob_james","crazy_legs"],"related":["Popular_music","Instrumental","Percussion_instrument","Stop-time","Section_(music)","Jazz","Charlie_Parker","A_Night_in_Tunisia","DJ","Section_(music)","Drop_(music)","False_ending","Peter_van_der_Merwe_(musicologist)","Bluegrass_music","Old_time_music","Melody","Instrumental_idiom","Backup_band","Banjo","Mandolin","Dobro","David_Toop","Dance_music","Charlie_Parker","Dizzy_Gillespie","Night_in_Tunisia","Sampling_(music)","DJ_Jazzy_Jay","James_Brown","Sampling_(music)","Music_loop","Soul_(music)","Audio_channel","Rhythmic","Hip_hop_music","Rapping","DJ_Kool_Herc","Jamaican","Afrika_Bambaataa","Breaking","Crazy_Legs_(dancer)","Frosty_Freeze","Rock_Steady_Crew","Breakbeat","Tom_Moulton","Don_Downing","Bridge_(music)","Arrangement","Dance_music","Noise","Sound_effect","Reverb","Verse-chorus_form","Mosh","Slam_dancing","Pinch_harmonics","Punk_rock","Skank_(dance)","Mosh","Circle_pit","Deathcore","Metalcore","Bass_drop","Whitechapel_(band)","Carnifex_(band)","The_Acacia_Strain","Post-hardcore","Horse_the_Band","Asking_Alexandria","Attack_Attack!","Enter_Shikari","Bluegrass_music","Foggy_Mountain_Breakdown","Earl_Scruggs","The_Meters","Creative_Source","The_J.B.'s","The_Blackbyrds","The_Last_Poets","Amen_Break","The_Winstons","Apache_(instrumental)","Incredible_Bongo_Band","DJ_Kool_Herc","The_Sugarhill_Gang","West_Street_Mob","Funky_Drummer","Public_Enemy_(group)","Run-D.M.C.","LL_Cool_J","Ice_Cube","Mandrill","DJ_Kool_Herc","Gil_Scott-Heron","Bob_James_(musician)","Paul_Simon","Run_DMC","Dennis_Coffey","Manu_Dibango","Captain_Sky","Drum_beat","Ultimate_Breaks_and_Beats","B-boying","Get_down"]}
