{"cursor":"41882","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n that used atomic energy to generate electricity.]] The 'Atomic Age', also known\n as the Atomic Era, is a phrase typically used to delineate the period of\n history following the detonation of the first atomic bomb, Trinity, on July 16,\n 1945. Although nuclear science existed before this event, the following bombing\n of Hiroshima, Japan represented the first large-scale use of nuclear technology\n and ushered in profound changes in socio-political thinking and the course of\n technology development. Atomic power was seen to be the epitome of progress and\n modernity.\n\nHowever, the Atomic Age fell far short of what was promised because nuclear\ntechnology has produced a range of social problems, from the arms race, to the\nChernobyl disaster and Three Mile Island accident, and the unresolved\ndifficulties of bomb plant cleanup and civilian plant waste disposal and\ndecommissioning. John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996).
