{"cursor":"21285","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of\nVarieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection' is the title of a joint\npresentation of two scientific papers to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July\n1858; On The Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type\nby Alfred Russel Wallace and an Extract from an unpublished Work on Species from\nCharles Darwin's Essay of 1844, together with an Abstract of a Letter from\nDarwin to Asa Gray. This was the first announcement of the Darwin â Wallace\ntheory of evolution by natural selection; the papers appeared in print on 20\nAugust 1858. The presentation of the papers spurred Darwin to write a condensed\n\"abstract\" of his \"big book\" on Natural Selection. The abstract was published in\nNovember 1859 as [[On the Origin of Species]].\n","linknr":295,"url":"On_the_Tendency_of_Species_to_form_Varieties;_and_on_the_Perpetuation_of_Varieties_and_Species_by_Natural_Means_of_Selection","recorded":1362483137,"links":14,"instances":["zoologist","botanist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology literature|Tendency of Species to form Varieties and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection","Works by Alfred Russel Wallace","Works by Charles Darwin","Academic journal articles","1858 works","Works originally published in British magazines","Works originally published in science and technology magazines"],"headings":["Events leading up to the publication","The reading","The paper","Impact of the publication","As an influence on cybernetics","Citations","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["robert_brown","botanist"],["thomas_bell","zoologist"],["robert_brown","botanist"],["thomas_bell","zoologist"]],"members":["thomas_bell","robert_brown"],"related":["Scientific_paper","Linnean_Society","London","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Charles_Darwin","Asa_Gray","Evolution","Natural_selection","Second_voyage_of_HMS_Beagle","Charles_Darwin","Clergy","Natural_history","South_America","University_of_Edinburgh","University_of_Cambridge","Charles_Lyell","Natural_selection","Evolution","Joseph_Dalton_Hooker","Alfred_Russel_Wallace","Borneo","Ternate","Asa_Gray","Charles_Waring_Darwin","Scarlet_fever","Linnean_Society_of_London","Asa_Gray","Robert_Brown_(botanist)","Linnean_Society_of_London","John_Joseph_Bennett","Thomas_Bell_(zoologist)","Reptile","Robert_Brown_(botanist)","William_Benjamin_Carpenter","William_Henry_Fitton","Daniel_Oliver","George_Bentham","Sussex","Portsmouth","Isle_of_Wight","Shanklin","Sandown","Joseph_Dalton_Hooker","Charles_Lyell","Thomas_Bell_(zoologist)","Evolution","Centrifugal_governor","Cybernetics","Gregory_Bateson","Systems_theory","The_Autobiography_of_Charles_Darwin","The_Autobiography_of_Charles_Darwin"]}
