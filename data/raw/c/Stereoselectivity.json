Stereoselectivity in Alkaline Epoxidation,\" Zimmerman, H. E.;\nSinger, L.; Thyagarajan, B. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1959, 81, 108-116. (b)Eliel,\nE., \"Stereochemistry of Carbon Compound\", McGraw-Hill, 1962 pp 434-436. is\nthe property of a chemical reaction in which a single reactant forms an unequal\nmixture of stereoisomers during the non-stereospecific creation of a new\nstereocenter or during the non-stereospecific transformation of a pre-existing\none. For instance, the S N1 reaction destroys a pre-existing\nstereocenter then creates a new one. The selectivity arises from\ndifferences in steric effects and electronic effects in the mechanistic pathways\nleading to the different products. Stereoselectivity can vary in degree but it\ncan never be total since the activation energy difference between the two\npathways is finite. However, in favorable cases, the minor stereoisomer may not\nbe detectable by the analytic methods used.\n\nAn 'enantioselective' reaction is one in which one enantiomer is formed in\npreference to the other, in a reaction that creates an optically active product\nfrom an achiral starting material, using either a chiral catalyst, an enzyme or\na chiral reagent. The degree of selectivity is measured by the enantiomeric\nexcess. An important variant is kinetic resolution, in which a pre-existing\nchiral center undergoes reaction with a chiral catalyst, an enzyme or a chiral\nreagent such that one enantiomer reacts faster than the other and leaves behind\nthe less reactive enantiomer, or in which a pre-existing chiral center\ninfluences the reactivity of a reaction center elsewhere in the same molecule.\n\nA 'diastereoselective' reaction is one in which one diastereomer is formed in\npreference to another (or in which a subset of all possible diastereomers\ndominates the product mixture), establishing a preferred relative\nstereochemistry. In this case, either two or more chiral centers are formed at\nonce such that one relative stereochemistry is favored, Or fewer than all\npossible relative stereochemistries are obtained. or a pre-existing chiral\ncenter (which needs not be optically pure) biases the stereochemical outcome\nduring the creation of another. The degree of relative selectivity is measured\nby the diastereomeric excess.\n\n'Stereoconvergence' can be considered an opposite of stereoselectivity, when the\nreaction of two different stereoisomers yield a single product stereoisomer.\n\nThe quality of stereoselectivity is concerned solely with the products, and\ntheir stereochemistry. Of a number of possible stereoisomeric products, the\nreaction selects one or two to be formed.\n","linknr":195,"url":"Stereoselectivity","recorded":1362889599,"links":27,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":["http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV5P0852.pdf","http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/V77P0078.pdf","http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/V77P0078.pdf"],"categories":["Stereochemistry"],"headings":["Examples","Stereoselective biosynthesis","See also","Notes and references"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Stereoselectivedehalogenation.svg/411px-Stereoselectivedehalogenation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Stereoselectiveadditiontonorbornene.svg/303px-Stereoselectiveadditiontonorbornene.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Stereoselectiveadditiontoathiazole.svg/370px-Stereoselectiveadditiontoathiazole.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/StereoselectiveSharplessOxidation.svg/309px-StereoselectiveSharplessOxidation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Stereoselectivereactionwithcarbocations.svg/518px-Stereoselectivereactionwithcarbocations.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/%28%2B%29-Pinoresinol_Biosynthesis.png/400px-%28%2B%29-Pinoresinol_Biosynthesis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chirality","chemistry"]],"members":["chirality"],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_reaction","Reactant","Stereoisomerism","Stereospecificity","Stereocenter","Stereospecificity","Steric","Electronic_effects","Enantiomer","Enzyme","Enantiomeric_excess","Kinetic_resolution","Diastereomer","Diastereomeric_excess","Dehydrohalogenation","J._Am._Chem._Soc.","Geometric_isomer","Diastereomer","Formic_acid","Norbornene","Exo_isomer","Organic_Syntheses","Cram's_rule","Diastereomer","Sharpless_epoxidation","Chirality_(chemistry)","Allylic_alcohol","Sharpless_asymmetric_dihydroxylation","Stereogenic","J._Am._Chem._Soc.","Angew._Chem._Int._Ed.","T-butyl","Pinoresinol","Dirigent_protein","Dirigent_protein","Pinoresinol","Coniferyl_alcohol","Dirigent_protein","Stereospecific","Dynamic_stereochemistry","Torquoselectivity","Regioselectivity","Chemoselectivity"]}
