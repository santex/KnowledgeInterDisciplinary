{"cursor":"1573","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Precision bias' is a form of cognitive bias in which an evaluator of\ninformation commits a logical fallacy as the result of confusing accuracy and\nprecision. More particularly, in assessing the merits of an argument, a\nmeasurement, or a report, an observer or assessor falls prey to precision bias\nwhen he or she believes that greater precision implies greater accuracy (i.e.,\nthat simply because a statement is precise, it is also true).\n\nPrecision bias, whether called by that phrase or another, is addressed in fields\nsuch as economics, in which there is a significant danger that a seemingly\nimpressive quantity of statistics may be collected even though these statistics\nmay be of little value for demonstrating any particular truth.\n\nIt is also called the numeracy bias, or the range estimate aversion.\n\nThe clustering illusion and the Texas sharpshooter fallacy may both be treated\nas relatives of precision bias. In these former fallacies, precision is\nmistakenly considered evidence of causation, when in fact the clustered\ninformation may actually be the result of randomness.\n","linknr":82,"url":"Precision_bias","recorded":1362480374,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.psig.org/papers/2000/0009.pdf"],"categories":["Cognitive biases"],"headings":["External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cognitive_bias","Fallacy","Accuracy_and_precision","Clustering_illusion","Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy","Randomness"]}
