{"cursor":"134580","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThis is one of a series of articles about the differences between '[[British\nEnglish]]' and '[[American English]]', which, for the purposes of these\narticles, are defined as follows:\n\n\n\n*'British English' (BrE) is the form of English used in the United Kingdom. It\nincludes all English dialects used within the United Kingdom. *'American\nEnglish' (AmE) is the form of English used in the United States. It includes all\nEnglish dialects used within the United States.\n\nWritten forms of British and American English as found in newspapers and\ntextbooks vary little in their essential features, with only occasional\nnoticeable differences in comparable media Even in vocabulary. \"A British\nreader of Time or Newsweek would note distinctly American expressions only a few\ntimes on any page, matching the few distinctly British expressions an American\nreader of The Economist would note.\"\n\nEdward Finegan in Language in the USA: Themes for the Twenty-first Century. Eds\nCharles Albert Ferguson, Edward Finegan, Shirley Brice Heath, John R. Rickford\n(Cambridge University Press, 2004). p. 29. See also: David Crystal, the\nCambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language] (Cambridge University Press,\n2003), p. 304. (comparing American newspapers with British newspapers, for\nexample). This kind of formal English, particularly written English, is often\ncalled \"standard English\". \"Standard English is essentially written, printed\nEnglish, seen in the textbooks, newspapers, and periodicals of the world â and\nalso, these days on the WWW. It is largely identical in its global\nmanifestation; we must allow only for the small amount of variation in vocab,\ngrammar and spelling which make up the differences between Am, Br, Aus and other\n'regional' standards.\"\n\nDavid Crystal, [http://www.davidcrystal.com/DC_articles/English9.pdf \"The Past,\nPresent, and Future of World English\"] in Andreas Gardt, Bernd-RÃ¼diger HÃ¼ppauf,\nBernd Huppauf (eds) Globalization and the future of German (Walter de Gruyter,\n2004). p. 39. NB: \"standard English\" as used to describe written and\nspoken international English is a more contentious usage.\n:\"standard English: In Sociolinguistics, a much debated term for the VARIETY of\n:English used as a communicative norm throughout the English-speaking world. The\n:notion has become increasingly difficult to handle because of the emergence of\n:differing national standards of usage (in vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation\n:and spelling) in areas where large numbers of people speak English as a first\n:or second language.\"\n:David Crystal, A Dictionary of Linguistics & Phonetics (Blackwell Publishing,\n2003). p. 431.\n\nThe spoken forms of British English vary considerably, reflecting a long history\nof dialect development amid isolated populations. In the United Kingdom,\ndialects, word use and accents vary not only between England, Northern Ireland,\nScotland and Wales, but also within them. [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) refers\nto a way of pronouncing Standard English that is actually used by about two\npercent of the UK population. It remains the accent upon which\ndictionary pronunciation guides are based, and for teaching English as a foreign\nlanguage. It is referred to colloquially as \"the Queen's English\", \"Oxford\nEnglish\" and \"BBC English\", although by no means all who live in Oxford speak\nwith such accent and the BBC does not require or use it exclusively.\n\nAn unofficial standard for spoken American English has also developed, as a\nresult of mass media and geographic and social mobility, and broadly describes\nthe English typically heard from network newscasters, commonly referred to as\nnon-regional diction, although local newscasters tend toward more parochial\nforms of speech. [http://dare.wisc.edu/ Dictionary of American Regional\nEnglish (DARE)] Despite this unofficial standard, regional variations of\nAmerican English have not only persisted but have actually intensified,\naccording to linguist William Labov.\n\nRegional dialects in the United States typically reflect some elements of the\nlanguage of the main immigrant groups in any particular region of the country,\nespecially in terms of pronunciation and vernacular vocabulary. Scholars have\nmapped at least four major regional variations of spoken American English:\nNorthern, Southern, Midland, and Western. Labov, William; Sharon Ash; &\nCharles Boberg. (2006). Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology\nand Sound Change. Berlin/New York: Mouton de Gruyter. ISBN 311-016746-8. Compare\nwith Labov, Ash, & Boberg. (1997). A national map of the regional dialects of\nAmerican English. Linguistics Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania.\n[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/NationalMap/NationalMap.html]. Retrieved\n16 April 2007. After the American Civil War, the settlement of the western\nterritories by migrants from the east led to dialect mixing and levelling, so\nthat regional dialects are most strongly differentiated in the eastern parts of\nthe country that were settled earlier. Localized dialects also exist with quite\ndistinct variations, such as in Southern Appalachia and New York.\n\nBritish and American English are the reference norms for English as spoken,\nwritten, and taught in the rest of the world. For instance member nations of the\nCommonwealth where English is not spoken natively, such as India, often closely\nfollow British English forms, while many American English usages are followed in\nother countries which have been historically influenced by the United States,\nsuch as the Philippines. Although most dialects of English used in the former\nBritish Empire outside of North America and Australia are, to various extents,\nbased on British English, most of the countries concerned have developed their\nown unique dialects, particularly with respect to pronunciation, idioms and\nvocabulary. Chief among other English dialects are Canadian English (based on\nthe English of United Empire Loyalists who left the 13 Colonies), \"[http://-\nbooks.google.ca/books?id=ia5tHVtQPn8C&pg=PA268&dq=%22northern+american+english%-\n22&ei=gbfRSJuAFYTMigGCvf3mAw&sig=ACfU3U1zW5pEVVvZbHNqbbpBiFsnsgR4jA#PPA422,M1\nCanadian English].\" Brinton, Laurel J., and Fee, Marjery, ed.

ISBN 0-521-26479-0, 9780521264792. On p. 422: \"It is now generally\nagreed that Canadian English originated as a variant of northern American\nEnglish (the speech of New England, New York, New Jersey and\nPennsylvania).\" and Australian English, which rank third and fourth in\nnumber of ''native'' speakers.\n\nFor the most part American vocabulary, phonology and syntax are used, to various\nextents, in Canada; therefore many prefer to refer to [[North American English]]\nrather than American English. Trudgill and Hannah, 2002 Nonetheless\nCanadian English also features many British English items and is often described\nas a unique blend of the two larger varieties alongside several distinctive\nCanadianisms. Australian English likewise blends American and British alongside\nnative usages, but retains a significantly higher degree of distinctiveness from\nboth of the larger varieties than does Canadian English, particularly in terms\nof pronunciation and vocabulary.\n","linknr":1152,"url":"American_and_British_English_differences","recorded":1371246839,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Comparison_of_American_and_British_English&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Comparison_of_American_and_British_English&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_British_English","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=American_and_British_English_differences&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_style#National_varieties_of_English","/wiki/British_English","/wiki/American_English","/wiki/American_English","/wiki/British_English","/wiki/British_and_American_keyboards","/wiki/Orthography","/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences","/wiki/Comparison_of_General_American_and_Received_Pronunciation","/wiki/American_and_British_English_pronunciation_differences","/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_British_English_(vocabulary)","/wiki/List_of_American_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States","/wiki/List_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English:_A%E2%80%93L","/wiki/List_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English:_M%E2%80%93Z","/wiki/List_of_works_with_different_titles_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_United_States","/wiki/Template:American_and_British_English_differences","/wiki/Template_talk:American_and_British_English_differences","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:American_and_British_English_differences&action=edit","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Dialect","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/United_States","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/English_English","/wiki/Mid-Ulster_English","/wiki/Scottish_English","/wiki/Welsh_English","/wiki/Received_Pronunciation","/wiki/Standard_English","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Social_mobility","/wiki/Newscasters","/wiki/Diction","/wiki/Parochialism","#cite_note-6","/wiki/William_Labov","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Vernacular","/wiki/Southern_American_English","/wiki/Midland_American_English","#cite_note-7","/wiki/American_Civil_War","/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/Idioms","/wiki/Canadian_English","/wiki/United_Empire_Loyalist","/wiki/13_Colonies","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Australian_English","/wiki/Geographical_distribution_of_english","/wiki/North_American_English","#cite_note-9","#Historical_background","#Grammar","#Nouns","#Formal_and_notional_agreement","#Verbs","#Verb_morphology","#Use_of_tenses","#Verbal_auxiliaries","#Transitivity","#Complementation","#Presence_or_absence_of_syntactic_elements","#The_definite_article","#Prepositions_and_adverbs","#Phrasal_verbs","#Miscellaneous_grammatical_differences","#Word_derivation_and_compounds","#Vocabulary","#Overview_of_lexical_differences","#Words_and_phrases_that_have_their_origins_in_BrE","#Words_and_phrases_that_have_their_origins_in_AmE","#Divergence","#Words_and_phrases_with_different_meanings","#Other_ambiguity_.28complex_cases.29","#Frequency","#Social_and_cultural_differences","#Education","#School","#University","#General_terms","#Politics","#Business.2FFinance","#Transport.2FTransportation","#Road_transport","#Rail_transport","#Television","#Levels_of_buildings","#Immigration","#Units_and_measurement","#Numbers","#Monetary_amounts","#Dates","#Time","#Weight","#Mathematics","#Holiday_greetings","#Idiosyncratic_differences","#Figures_of_speech","#Equivalent_idioms","#Writing","#Spelling","#Punctuation","#Full_stops_and_periods_in_abbreviations","#Restrictive_and_non-restrictive_modifiers","#Quoting","#Quotation_usage","#Parentheses.2Fbrackets","#Titles_and_headlines","#Keyboard_layouts","#See_also","#Sources","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Comparison_of_American_and_British_English&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Americas","/wiki/British_colonization_of_the_Americas","/wiki/Jame
