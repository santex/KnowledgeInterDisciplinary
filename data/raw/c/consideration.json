{"cursor":"9663","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Consideration' is the concept of legal value in connection with contracts. It\nis anything of value promised to another when making a contract. It can take the\nform of money, physical objects, services, promised actions, abstinence from a\nfuture action, and much more. Consideration to create a legally enforceable\ncontract entails a detriment to the promisee OR a benefit to the promisor. Under\nthe notion of \"pre-existing duties\", if either the promisor or the promisee\nalready had a legal obligation to render such payment, it cannot be seen as\nconsideration in the legal sense.\n\nIn common law it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before\na contract can be thought of as binding.\n\nHowever, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible\nrecovery under [[quantum meruit]] (sometimes referred to as a quasi-contract) or\npromissory estoppel.\n\nIf A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the\n$5,000, and B's consideration is the car.\n\nAdditionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for\n$500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's\nconsideration is $500 paid to A.\n\nFurther, if A signs a contract with B such that A will not repaint his own\nhouse in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep\nthis deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to\naffirmatively do anything, A did promise not to do something that he was\nallowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the\nforbearance in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's\nconsideration to A is $500 per year.\n\nConversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's\nconsideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there\nis no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A,\nthen B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract,\nit is a valid gift.\n\nThere are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in\na contract.\n","linknr":183,"url":"consideration","recorded":1362572407,"links":18,"instances":["law","litigation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal doctrines and principles","Contract law"],"headings":["Monetary value of consideration","Pre-existing legal duties","Bundled terms","Past consideration","Option contracts and conditional consideration","In settlements","Treatments by different legal systems","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gift","law"],["settlement","litigation"]],"members":["gift","settlement"],"related":["Contract","Common_law","Quasi-contract","Gift_(law)","Settlement_(litigation)","Accord_and_satisfaction","At-will_employment","At-will_employment","Tort","Compensatory_damages","Punitive_damages","Consideration_under_English_law","Consideration_under_American_law","Scots_contract_law"]}
