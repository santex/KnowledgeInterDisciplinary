The infection causes characteristic patterns (mottling and\ndiscoloration) on the leaves (hence the name). TMV was the first virus to be\ndiscovered. Although it was known from the late 19th century that an infectious\ndisease was damaging tobacco crops, it was not until 1930 that the infectious\nagent was determined to be a virus.\n","linknr":334,"url":"Tobacco_Mosaic_Virus","recorded":1362505901,"links":47,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Documents/1998/ZaitlinDiscoveryCausalAgentTobaccoMosaicVirus.pdf","http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Documents/1998/ZaitlinDiscoveryCausalAgentTobaccoMosaicVirus.pdf"],"categories":["Viruses","Model organisms","Tobacco diseases","Viral plant pathogens and diseases"],"headings":["History","Structure","Physicochemical properties","Disease cycle","Host and symptoms","Transference to humans","Environment","Treatment and management","Scientific and environmental impact","Investigational uses","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/TobaccoMosaicVirus.jpg/220px-TobaccoMosaicVirus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/TMV_structure_full.png/300px-TMV_structure_full.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Tobacco_Mosaic_Virus_structure.png/220px-Tobacco_Mosaic_Virus_structure.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_tobacco.jpg/220px-Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_tobacco.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_orchid.jpg/220px-Tobacco_mosaic_virus_symptoms_orchid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/TMV_virus_super_resolution_microscopy_Christoph_Cremer_Christina_Wege.jpg/220px-TMV_virus_super_resolution_microscopy_Christoph_Cremer_Christina_Wege.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sense","molecular_biology#rna_sense_in_viruses"]],"members":["sense"],"related":["Virgaviridae","RNA_virus","Tobacco","Solanaceae","Infection","Mottling","Leaf","Virus","Infectious_disease","Adolf_Mayer","Bacteria","Dmitri_Ivanovsky","Chamberland_filter","Candle","Chamberland_filter","Martinus_Beijerinck","Wendell_Meredith_Stanley","Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry","Autocatalysis","Helmut_Ruska","Ernst_Ruska","Heinz_Fraenkel-Conrat","Robley_Williams","Capsid","Crystallographer","Rosalind_Franklin","University_of_California,_Berkeley","1958_World's_Fair","Brussels","RNA","Virology","Capsid","Capsid","Molecules","Electron_Microscope","Amino_acids","Fiber_diffraction","Electron_density","Index_of_refraction","Plasmodesmata","Atomic_mass_unit","Movement_proteins","Phloem","Capsid","RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase","North_Carolina","Tomato","Capsicum","Solanaceae","Cucumber","Leaves","Celsius","Elsevier_Academic_Press","Structural_biology","X-ray_diffraction","Greenhouse"]}
