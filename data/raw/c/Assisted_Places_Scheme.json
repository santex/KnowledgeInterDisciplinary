{"cursor":"2633","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'Assisted Places Scheme' was established in the UK by the Conservative\ngovernment in 1980. Children who could not afford to go to fee-paying\nindependent schools were provided with free or subsidised places - if they were\nable to score within the top 10-15% of applicants in the school's entrance\nexamination. By 1985, the scheme catered for some 6,000 students per year. The\nscheme, to a degree, replicated the effect of the direct grant grammar schools\nwhich had operated between 1945 and 1976. Between 1981 and 1997 an estimated\n80,000 children participated in the scheme, costing a total of just over Â£800\nmillion. In 1981, 4,185 pupils gained assisted places. By 1997 there were some\n34,000 pupils and 355 schools in this scheme.\n\nArguing the practice to be elitist and wasteful of public funds, the Labour\ngovernment of Tony Blair, upon its election in 1997, abolished the Assisted\nPlaces Scheme. The government announced that the funds were instead to be used\nto reduce class sizes in state nursery schools. However, children\nalready in receipt of an assisted place were allowed to complete the remainder\nof that phase of their education.\n\nThe result of abolition has been to reduce the social range of pupils educated\nat independent schools. Some independent schools, most of which have charitable\nstatus, have taken steps to provide their own funding for pupils from poorer\nbackgrounds through bursaries.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Assisted_Places_Scheme","recorded":1364139597,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Premiership_of_Margaret_Thatcher","/wiki/Independent_school_(United_Kingdom)","/wiki/Direct_grant_grammar_school","#cite_note-Q14051997-1","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Premiership_of_Tony_Blair","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Bursary","/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-Q14051997_1-0","http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/issues/education.shtml","http://web.archive.org/web/20110618155343/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/issues/education.shtml","http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/issues/education.shtml","#cite_ref-2","http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/55984.stm","#cite_ref-3","http://www.which-school.co.uk/en/assisted-places-scheme","http://www.which-school.co.uk/en/assisted-places-scheme","/wiki/File:Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_(HM_Government).svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg/45px-Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_%28HM_Government%29.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-gov-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:UK-gov-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-gov-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&oldid=497217266","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Education_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:Scholarships_in_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom_government_stubs","/wiki/Category:Use_dmy_dates_from_March_2012","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Assisted+Places+Scheme&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Assisted+Places+Scheme","/wiki/Assisted_Places_Scheme","/wiki/Talk:Assisted_Places_Scheme","#","/wiki/Assisted_Places_Scheme","/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Assisted_Places_Scheme","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Assisted_Places_Scheme","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&oldid=497217266","/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Assisted_Places_Scheme&id=497217266","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Assisted+Places+Scheme","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Assisted+Places+Scheme&oldid=497217266&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Assisted_Places_Scheme&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisted_Places_Scheme","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw
