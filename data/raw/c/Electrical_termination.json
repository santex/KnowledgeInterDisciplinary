{"cursor":"3969","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nTermination}}\n\n\n\n'Electrical termination' of a signal involves providing a 'terminator' at the\nend of a wire or cable to prevent an RF signal from being reflected back from\nthe end, causing interference. The terminator is placed at the end of a\ntransmission line or daisy chain bus (such as in SCSI), designed to match\nimpedance and hence minimize signal reflections.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Electrical_termination","recorded":1362486649,"links":21,"instances":["electrical_engineering","computing","communication","electronics","signal","telecommunication","electrical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronic circuits","SCSI"],"headings":["Types of terminators","Applications","See also","Issues","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/10base2_terminator.png/220px-10base2_terminator.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/SCSI-terminator-exposed-hdr-0a.jpg/220px-SCSI-terminator-exposed-hdr-0a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signalling","telecommunication"],["interference","communication"],["daisy_chain","electrical_engineering"],["bus","computing"],["reflection","electrical"],["overshoot","signal"],["biasing","electronics"]],"members":["daisy_chain","bus","interference","biasing","overshoot","signalling","reflection"],"related":["Signalling_(telecommunication)","Radio_frequency","Interference_(communication)","Transmission_line","Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)","Bus_(computing)","SCSI","Impedance_matching","Characteristic_impedance","Reflection_(electrical)","Resistor","SCSI","Linear_regulator","Single-ended_signalling","Diode","Overshoot_(signal)","SCSI","Controller_area_network","Ethernet_terminator","10BASE2","BNC_connector","Coaxial_cable","F_connector","MIL-STD-1553","Electrical_connector","Electrical_network","MIL-STD-1553","Signal_reflection","Impedance_matching","Biasing_(electronics)"]}
