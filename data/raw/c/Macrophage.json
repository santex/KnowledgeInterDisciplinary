'MÎ¦') are cells\nproduced by the differentiation of monocytes in tissues. Macrophages were\ndiscovered by Ilya Mechnikov, a Russian bacteriologist, in 1884.\nHuman macrophages are about in diameter. Monocytes and macrophages\nare phagocytes. Macrophages function in both non-specific defense (innate\nimmunity) as well as help initiate specific defense mechanisms (adaptive\nimmunity) of vertebrate animals. Their role is to phagocytose, or engulf and\nthen digest, cellular debris and pathogens, either as stationary or as mobile\ncells. They also stimulate lymphocytes and other immune cells to respond to\npathogens. They are specialized phagocytic cells that attack foreign substances,\ninfectious microbes and cancer cells through destruction and ingestion.\nMacrophages can be identified by specific expression of a number of proteins\nincluding CD14, CD40, CD11b, CD64, F4/80 (mice)/EMR1 (human), lysozyme M, MAC-1/MAC-\n3 and CD68 by flow cytometry or immunohistochemical staining. They move by action of amoeboid movement.\n","linknr":485,"url":"Macrophage","recorded":1362512980,"links":59,"instances":["protein","medical","blood_vessel","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Macrophages","Phagocytes","Cell biology","Immune system","Human cells","Articles containing video clips","Connective tissue cells"],"headings":["Life cycle","Function","Tissue macrophages","Disease","Media","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Macrophage.jpg/250px-Macrophage.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Phagocytosis_ZP.svg/400px-Phagocytosis_ZP.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Macrophage.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/S4-J774_Cells_with_Conidia_in_Liquid_Media.ogg/115px--S4-J774_Cells_with_Conidia_in_Liquid_Media.ogg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/S3-Alveolar_Macrophages_with_Conidia_in_Liquid_Medium.ogg/115px--S3-Alveolar_Macrophages_with_Conidia_in_Liquid_Medium.ogg.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["cd40","protein"],["cd64","biology"],["assimilation","biology"],["sinusoid","blood_vessel"],["hypoxia","medical"]],"members":["cd40","hypoxia","sinusoid","assimilation","cell","cd64"],"related":["Mouse","Pseudopodia","Pathogen","Trypan_blue","Cell_(biology)","Monocyte","Ilya_Mechnikov","Phagocyte","Innate_immunity","Adaptive_immunity","Phagocytosis","Pathogen","Lymphocyte","Microbes","CD14","CD40_(protein)","CD11b","CD64_(biology)","F4/80","EMR1","Lysozyme","Macrophage-1_antigen","CD68","Flow_cytometry","Immunohistochemical_staining","Amoeboid_movement","Monocyte","Endothelium","Blood_vessel","Leukocyte_extravasation","Chemotaxis","Cytokines","Neutrophil","Phagolysosome","Assimilation_(biology)","Pathogen","Phagosome","Lysosome","Cytoplasm","Cell_membrane","Neutrophil_granulocyte","CD31","Lysosome","Enzymes","Dendritic_cells","Monokine","Interleukin-1","Lymphokine","Antigen","Helper_T_cell","Major_histocompatibility_complex","Antibody","Major_histocompatibility_complex","T_helper_cell","Interleukin_12","CD40","CD40L","Opsonisation","Phagocytes","Fungus","Parasite","Lymphokine","Lipopolysaccharide","Interferon-gamma","Interleukin_12","Interleukin_10","Interleukin_10","Interleukin_4","Macrophages","Anti-F4/80","Myonuclei","Pax7","MyoD","Dust_cell","Pulmonary_alveolus","Lungs","Adipose_tissue_macrophages","Adipose_tissue","Histiocytes","Connective_tissue","Kupffer_cell","Liver","Microglia","Neural_tissue","Epithelioid_cell","Granulomas","Osteoclasts","Bone","Hofbauer_cell","Placenta","Sinusoid_(blood_vessel)","Spleen","Giant_cell","Connective_tissue","Peritoneal_macrophages","Peritoneal_cavity","Paracrine","Leydig_cells","Granuloma","Tuberculosis","Leishmaniasis","Tuberculosis","Atherosclerosis","Human_Immunodeficiency_Virus","T_cells","Hypoxia_(medical)","Chronic_inflammation","Tumor_necrosis_factor","NF-κB","Apoptosis","Conidia","Interferon-γ","Alveolar_macrophage","Conidia"]}
