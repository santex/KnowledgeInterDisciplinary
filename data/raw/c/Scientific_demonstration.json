{"cursor":"2123","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'scientific demonstration' is a scientific experiment carried out for the\npurposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for hypothesis\ntesting or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried\nout for these purposes).\n\nMany scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational\nmerit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena\nsuch as explosions.\n\nSome famous scientific demonstrations include:\n\n    * Al-Biruni's reaction time\n    * Alhazen's camera obscura, lamp experiment and magnifying lens\n    * Al-Jazari's crankshaft, elephant clock and programmable robots\n    * Avenzoar's parasites\n    * Detonating a cloud of flour\n    * Foucault's pendulum\n    * Galileo Galilei's ball experiments, pendulum and telescope\n    * Heron's fountain and aeolipile\n    * Ibn al-Nafis' pulmonary circulation and coronary circulation\n    * Gyroscopic bicycle wheel\n    * Prince Rupert's Drops\n    * Shooting a candle through a plank\n    * Taqi al-Din's alarm clock, steam turbine\n    * Using a linear motor as a gun\n    * Using compressed air to drive a water rocket\n    * Using liquid nitrogen to shatter a rose\n    * William Harvey's circulatory system\n\nNote: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not\n      be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate\n      safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once\n      mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to\n      demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some\n      older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid\n      mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by\n      anyone under any circumstances.\n","linknr":115,"url":"Scientific_demonstration","recorded":1362567140,"links":14,"instances":["wood"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Science education"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Science-symbol-2.svg/30px-Science-symbol-2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plank","wood"]],"members":["plank"],"related":["Scientific_experiment","Hypothesis_testing","Abū_Rayhān_al-Bīrūnī","Reaction_time","Ibn_al-Haytham","Camera_obscura","Oil_lamp","Magnifying_lens","Al-Jazari","Crankshaft","Elephant_clock","Robot","Ibn_Zuhr","Parasite","Detonation","Flour","Foucault_pendulum","Galileo_Galilei","Pendulum","Telescope","Heron's_fountain","Aeolipile","Ibn_al-Nafis","Pulmonary_circulation","Coronary_circulation","Gyroscope","Bicycle_wheel","Prince_Rupert's_Drop","Candle","Plank_(wood)","Taqi_al-Din_Muhammad_ibn_Ma'ruf","Alarm_clock","Steam_turbine","Linear_motor","Water_rocket","Liquid_nitrogen","William_Harvey","Circulatory_system","Technology_demonstration"]}
