However, uncertainty of the commercial\nviability and regulatory approval of new products and technologies makes\ninnovation a very risky undertaking. Conventional internal financing of\ninnovation is generally not possible because biotech firms tend to be small with\nmeager profits and few cash resources. SWORD financing is used to encourage\ninnovation by diversifying risk across wide financial markets. SWORD provides\ninvestors an opportunity to identify and finance underfunded, yet attractive\nprojects. An SPE acts as an intermediary between the parent company and the\ninvestors, separating the project from the existing liabilities of the parent\ncompany. To provide flexibility and liquidity for all the parties, an SPE issues\nspecial securities (units) and raises finance via public or private offerings.\nIn essence, one unit is a portfolio consisting of one share of SPEâs equity, one\nwarrant to purchase a share of the parent firms' common stock, and a call option\nfor the parent firm to buy back shares of SPE.\n","linknr":264,"url":"SWORD-financing","recorded":1362504061,"links":19,"instances":["finance","finance","finance"],"pdf":["http://www.fma.org/SLC/DSS/Theodossiou_doctoral.pdf"],"categories":["Corporate finance","Venture capital"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg/16px-Symbol_list_class.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Chicklet-currency.jpg/90px-Chicklet-currency.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/ThreeCoins.svg/40px-ThreeCoins.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["portfolio","finance"],["warrant","finance"],["seniority","finance"]],"members":["portfolio","warrant","seniority"],"related":["Financing","Biotech","R&D","Special_purpose_entity","Innovation","Biotech","Uncertainty","Innovation","Financing","Cash","Risk","Liabilities","Liquidity","Portfolio_(finance)","Warrant_(finance)","Call_option","Hybrid_security","Seniority_(finance)","Venture_lending"]}
