{"cursor":"7458","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n Oblast, Russia.]] clinic in Greenwich, London.]]\n\nA 'clinic' (or 'outpatient clinic' or 'ambulatory care clinic') is a health care\nfacility that is primarily devoted to the care of outpatients. Clinics can be\nprivately operated or publicly managed and funded, and typically cover the\nprimary health care needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to\nlarger hospitals which offer specialised treatments and admit inpatients for\novernight stays. Some clinics grow to be institutions as large as major\nhospitals, or become associated with a hospital or medical school, while\nretaining the name âclinic.\"\n","linknr":230,"url":"Clinic","recorded":1362506261,"links":33,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of healthcare facilities","Health centers"],"headings":["Overview","Etymology","Function","Types","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/VelikiVrag-Medpunkt-1435.jpg/220px-VelikiVrag-Medpunkt-1435.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/GreenwichSurgeryClinic_bordercropped.jpg/220px-GreenwichSurgeryClinic_bordercropped.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/13px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Russia","Greenwich","London","Health_care_provider","Outpatients","Hospital","Inpatients","Medical_school","General_practitioner","Medical_practice_consultants","Physiotherapy","Clinical_psychologists","Medicine_in_China","Healthcare_in_India","Barefoot_doctors","Russia","Africa","Ayurvedic","Unani","Traditional_medicine","Webster's_Revised_Unabridged_Dictionary","Primary_health_care","Triage","Emergency_room","X-ray","CLSC","Quebec","Canada","Health_care_in_the_United_States","Free_clinic","Retail_Based_Clinic","Nurse_practitioners","Polyclinic","Sexual_health_clinic","Sexually_transmitted_infections","Fertility_clinic","Abortion_clinic","Abortion","Ambulatory_surgery_center","Tavistock_Clinic","National_Health_Service","R_D_Laing","Suitcase_Clinic","Berkeley_Free_Clinic","Haight_Ashbury_Free_Clinic","Christian_Medical_College_&_Hospital","The_Edmonton_Clinic","The_Shyness_Clinic","La_Borde_clinic","Mayo_Clinic","Cleveland_Clinic","Marshfield_Clinic","Lahey_Clinic","Health_care_system","United_States","Gary_Burnstein_Community_Health_Clinic","Jodhpur","Rajasthan","India","Health_care_provider","Health_center","Health_systems_management","Healthcare_system","Nurse-led_clinic"]}
