{"cursor":"6709","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Cenozoic' Era ( or ; also 'CÃ¦nozoic', 'Caenozoic' or 'Cainozoic'; meaning\n\"new life\", from Greek kainos \"new\", and zoe \"life\") is the current and most\nrecent of the three Phanerozoic geological eras, following the Mesozoic Era and\ncovering the period from 65 millions years ago to the present.\n\nThe era began in the wake of the CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event (K-Pg\nevent) at the end of the Cretaceous that saw the demise of the last non-avian\ndinosaurs (as well as other terrestrial and marine flora and fauna) at the end\nof the Mesozoic. The Cenozoic is also known as the 'Age of Mammals', because the\nextinction of many groups allowed mammals to greatly diversify.\n\nEarly in the Cenozoic, following the K-Pg event, the planet was dominated by\nrelatively small fauna, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, and\namphibians. From a geological perspective, it did not take long for mammals and\nbirds to greatly diversify in the absence of the large reptiles that had\ndominated during the Mesozoic. Some birds grew larger than the average human.\nThis group became known as the \"terror birds,\" and were formidable predators.\nMammals came to occupy almost every available niche (both marine and\nterrestrial), and some also grew very large, attaining sizes not seen in most of\ntoday's mammals.\n\nClimate-wise, the Earth had begun a drying and cooling trend, culminating in the\nglaciations of the Pleistocene Epoch, and partially offset by the Paleocene-\nEocene Thermal Maximum. The continents also began looking roughly familiar at\nthis time and moved into their current positions.\n","linknr":554,"url":"Cenozoic","recorded":1362372867,"links":75,"instances":["continent","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2009.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Geologic time scale","Cenozoic","Geological history of Earth"],"headings":["Subdivisions","Tectonics","Climate","Life","See also","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Miocene.jpg/240px-Miocene.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["era","geology"],["australia","continent"]],"members":["australia","era"],"related":["Era_(geology)","Greek_language","Phanerozoic","Geological_era","Mesozoic_Era","Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event","Cretaceous","Dinosaur","Terror_bird","Ecological_niche","Quaternary_glaciation","Pleistocene_Epoch","Paleocene-Eocene_Thermal_Maximum","Paleogene","Neogene","Quaternary","Paleocene","Eocene","Oligocene","Miocene","Pliocene","Pleistocene","Holocene","International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy","Tertiary_Period","Paleontologist","Geology","Continent","Australia_(continent)","Gondwana","South-east_Asia","Antarctica","South_Pole","Atlantic_Ocean","South_America","North_America","Tethys_ocean","Paleocene–Eocene_Thermal_Maximum","Azolla_event","Drake_Passage","Oligocene","Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current","Miocene","Isthmus_of_Panama","Humboldt_Current","Gulf_Stream","Quaternary_glaciation","Interglacial","Holocene","Terrestrial_animal","Marine_mammal","Bat","Bird","Savanna","Flowering_plant","Insect","Grass","Snake","Colubrids","Rodent","Gastornithiformes","Crocodilia","Uintathere","Mesonychid","Pantodont","Chalicothere","Creodont","Whale","Primates","Entelodont","Saber-toothed_cats","Mastodon","Mammoth","Three-toed_horse","Rhinoceros","Brontothere","Geologic_Time_Scale","Cretaceous–Paleogene_boundary","Mesozoic","Paleozoic","Precambrian"]}
