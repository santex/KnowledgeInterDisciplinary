{"cursor":"18560","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'excise' or 'excise tax' (sometimes called a duty of excise special tax) is\nan inland tax on the sale, or production for sale, of specific goods or a tax on\na good produced for sale, or sold, within a country or licenses for specific\nactivities. Excises are distinguished from customs duties, which are taxes on\nimportation. Excises are inland taxes, whereas customs duties are border taxes.\n\nAn excise is considered an indirect tax, meaning that the producer or seller who\npays the tax to the government is expected to try to recover or shift the tax by\nraising the price paid by the buyer. Excises are typically imposed in addition\nto another indirect tax such as a sales tax or value added tax (VAT). In common\nterminology (but not necessarily in law), an excise is distinguished from a\nsales tax or VAT in three ways: (i) an excise typically applies to a narrower\nrange of products; (ii) an excise is typically heavier, accounting for a higher\nfraction of the retail price of the targeted products; and (iii) an excise is\ntypically a per unit tax, costing a specific amount for a volume or unit of the\nitem purchased, whereas a sales tax or VAT is an ad valorem tax and proportional\nto the price of the good.\n\nTypical examples of excise duties are taxes on gasoline and other fuels, and\ntaxes on tobacco and alcohol (sometimes referred to as sin tax).\n","linknr":462,"url":"Excise","recorded":1362677428,"links":51,"instances":["econo__mics","economics","economics","proposed_law","economics","legal"],"pdf":["http://clubs.myams.org/qmp/parties/bills/lib-prostitution.pdf","http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1997/118pdf/118251.pdf","http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/ifa/zpe/downloads/1997/118pdf/118251.pdf"],"categories":["Excise taxes"],"headings":["Definition","Rationale","Targets of taxation","Examples","Machinery of implementation","Criticisms","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/USFederalExciseTaxShareByIncomeLevel.1979-2007.png/240px-USFederalExciseTaxShareByIncomeLevel.1979-2007.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["duty","economics"],["goods","economics"],["service","economics"],["reparation","legal"],["bill","proposed_law"],["elasticity","econo__mics"]],"members":["elasticity","goods","duty","bill","service","reparation"],"related":["Duty_(economics)","Tax","Goods_(economics)","Customs","Indirect_tax","Sales_tax","Value_added_tax","Per_unit_tax","Ad_valorem_tax","Gasoline","Tobacco","Alcohol","Sin_tax","HM_Revenue_and_Customs","Alcohol","Gambling","Money_laundering","Tax_refund","Service_(economics)","Australian_Taxation_Office","Australia","High_Court_of_Australia","Adam_Smith","Samuel_Johnson","Tobacco","Alcohol","Sumptuary_tax","Morality","Gambling","Prostitution","Solicitation","Pimp","Vice_tax","Sin_tax","Pollution","Reparation_(legal)","War_reparations","Tax_evasion","Legal_drugs","Lung_cancer","Cirrhosis_of_the_liver","Addictive","Kansas","Stamp_duty","Revenue_stamp","Ace_of_spades","Pack_of_cards","Documents","Dice","Stamp_Act_1765","Bill_(proposed_law)","Canadian_Parliament","Nevada_Legislature","History_of_salt","Paper","Coffee","Window_tax","Income_tax","Elasticity_(econo__mics)","Cigarette","Gasoline","Alcohol","Air_conditioners","Sin_tax","Poll_tax","Anchorage,_Alaska","Excise_tax","Diesel_fuel","British_Government","United_Kingdom","Value_added_tax","Customs_Duties","Indirect_tax","Air_Passenger_Duty","United_Kingdom_Climate_Change_Programme","Insurance_Premium_Tax","Landfill_Tax","Aggregates_Levy","Import","Export","Inland_Revenue","Direct_tax","HM_Revenue_and_Customs","Revenue_stamp","Tobacco","Alcohol","Bulk_purchasing","Excise_stamp","Government","Cigarettes","Distilled_beverage","Alcohol_monopoly","Customs_duties","Duty-free","Revenue_stamp","Customs","Securities_Turnover_Excise_Tax"]}
