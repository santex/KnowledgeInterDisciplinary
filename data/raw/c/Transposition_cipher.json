{"cursor":"11582","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn cryptography, a 'transposition cipher' is a method of encryption by which the\npositions held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of\ncharacters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the ciphertext\nconstitutes a permutation of the plaintext. That is, the order of the units is\nchanged. Mathematically a bijective function is used on the characters'\npositions to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt.\n\nFollowing are some implementations.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Transposition_cipher","recorded":1362903619,"links":31,"instances":["world_war_ii","information","cryptography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Classical ciphers","Permutations"],"headings":["Rail Fence cipher","Route cipher","Columnar transposition","Double transposition","Myszkowski transposition","Disrupted transposition","Grilles","Detection and cryptanalysis","Combinations","Fractionation","Notes","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["code","cryptography"],["maquis","world_war_ii"],["ban","information"]],"members":["maquis","ban","code"],"related":["Cryptography","Plaintext","Ciphertext","Permutation","Bijective","Inverse_function","Rail_fence","Rail_fence","American_Civil_War","Code_(cryptography)","Substitution_cipher","Anagram","World_War_I","Maquis_(World_War_II)","Special_Operations_Executive","Office_of_Strategic_Services","VIC_cipher","Cryptanalysis","Frequency_distribution","Anagram","Genetic_algorithm","Substitution_cipher","Polybius_square","Straddling_checkerboard","Morse_code","Claude_E._Shannon","Confusion_and_diffusion","Bifid_cipher","Trifid_cipher","ADFGVX_cipher","VIC_cipher","Block_cipher","Permutation_cipher","Substitution_cipher","Ban_(information)","Topics_in_cryptography","Numerical_cipher"]}
