{"cursor":"58111","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Clinical trials' are sets of tests in medical research and drug development\nthat generate safety and efficacy data (or more specifically, information about\nadverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) for health\ninterventions (e.g., drugs, diagnostics, devices, therapy protocols). They are\nconducted only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality\nof the nonclinical safety, and health authority/ethics committee approval is\ngranted in the country where approval of the drug or device is sought.\nPreviously, many emerging countries did not require local trials for product\napprovals. Now, though emerging countries still accept data from U.S./Europe,\nthey also require some local trials.

As positive\nsafety and efficacy data are gathered, the number of patients is typically\nincreased. Clinical trials can vary in size, and can involve a single research\nentity in one country or many such entities in multiple countries.\n\nA full series of trials may incur sizable costs, and the burden of paying for\nall the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor, which may\nbe a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical\ndevice company. When the diversity of required support roles exceeds the\nresources of the sponsor, a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner,\nsuch as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the\nacademic sector.\n","linknr":585,"url":"Clinical_trial","recorded":1362505210,"links":49,"instances":["japan","united_states"],"pdf":["http://www.ich.org/LOB/media/MEDIA482.pdf","http://www.pharm-olam.com/pdf/POI-Seasonality.pdf","http://www.pharm-olam.com/pdf/POI-Seasonality.pdf","http://irb.ucsd.edu/ab_2328_bill_20020826_enrolled.pdf","http://www.hhlaw.com/files/Publication/edbf3429-125c-41c9-9442-b552e69b756c/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/972a9053-8c8d-46e4-ac96-ecf4892a8643/Pharma.pdf","http://www.hhlaw.com/files/Publication/edbf3429-125c-41c9-9442-b552e69b756c/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/972a9053-8c8d-46e4-ac96-ecf4892a8643/Pharma.pdf","http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf","http://www.pmda.go.jp/ich/s/s1b_98_7_9e.pdf"],"categories":["Design
