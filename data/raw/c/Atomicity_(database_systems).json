{"cursor":"5734","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn database systems, 'atomicity' (or 'atomicness'; from Greek a-tomos,\nundividable) is one of the ACID transaction properties. In an 'atomic\ntransaction', a series of database operations either all occur, or nothing\noccurs. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring only\npartially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series\noutright. In other words, atomicity means indivisibility and\nirreducibility. {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-03-23 location = http://www.webopedia.com/ publisher =\n| Webopedia title = atomic operation quote = An operation during which a\n| processor can simultaneously read a location and write it in the same bus\n| operation. This prevents any other processor or I/O device from writing or\n| reading memory until the operation is complete. url =\n| http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/atomic_operation.html}}\n\nThe etymology of the phrase originates in the Classical Greek concept of a\nfundamental and indivisible component; see atom.\n\nAn example of atomicity is ordering an airline ticket where two actions are\nrequired: payment, and a seat reservation. The potential passenger must either:\n# both pay for and reserve a seat; OR neither pay for nor reserve a seat.\nThe booking system does not consider it acceptable for a customer to pay for a\nticket without securing the seat, nor to reserve the seat without payment\nsucceeding.\n\nAnother example: If one wants to transfer some amount of money from one account\nto another, then he/she would start a procedure to do it. However, if a failure\noccurs, then due to atomicity, the amount will either be transferred completely\nor will not even start. Thus atomicity protects the user from losing money due\nto a failed transaction.\n","linknr":119,"url":"Atomicity_(database_systems)","recorded":1362891742,"links":13,"instances":["computer_science","computer_science","concept"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data management","Transaction processing"],"headings":["Orthogonality","Implementation","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["isolation","computer_science"],["durability","computer_science"],["nosql","concept"]],"members":["durability","isolation","nosql"],"related":["Database_system","Greek_language","ACID","Database_transaction","Atom","ACID","Isolation_(computer_science)","Deadlock","Database_consistency","Durability_(computer_science)","Journaling_file_system","Metadata","Operating_system","Pre-emptive_multitasking","POSIX","System_call","Userspace","Linearizability","Test-and-set","Language_primitive","Machine_language","Assembly_language","NoSQL_(concept)","Data_store","Column_family","Atomic_operation","Transaction_processing","Long-running_transaction"]}
