Google Search is the most-used search engine on the World Wide\nWeb, receiving several hundred million queries each day through its\nvarious services.\n\nThe order of search results on Google's search-results pages is based, in part,\non a priority rank called a \"PageRank\". Google Search provides many options for\ncustomized search, using Boolean operators such as: exclusion (\"-xx\"),\nalternatives (\"xx OR yy\"), and wildcards (\"x * x\").\n\nThe main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible\ndocuments offered by web servers (in formats such as HTML, PDF, etc.), as\nopposed to other data, such as with Google Image Search. Google Search was\noriginally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997. Google\nSearch provides at least 22 special features beyond the original word-search\ncapability. These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time\nzones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home\nlistings, and sports scores. There are special features for dates, including\nranges (70..73), prices, temperatures, money/unit conversions\n(\"10.5 cm in inches\"), calculations (), package tracking, patents, area\ncodes, and language translation of displayed pages. In June 2011,\nGoogle introduced \"Google Voice Search\" and \"Search by Image\" features for\nallowing the users to search words by speaking and by giving images.\nIn May 2012, Google introduced a new Knowledge Graph semantic search feature to\ncustomers in the U.S.\n\nThe frequency of use of many search terms has reached such a volume that they\nmay indicate broader economic, social and health trends.\nData about the frequency of use of search terms on Google (available through\nGoogle Adwords, Google Trends, and Google Insights for Search) have been shown\nto correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels and provide the\ninformation faster than traditional reporting methods and government surveys.\n\nMajor competitors of Google are Baidu and Soso.com in China and South Korea;\nNaver.com, in South Korea; Yandex in Russia; Seznam.cz in Czech Republic; Yahoo!\nin Japan and Taiwan. Another potential competitor is Bing. {{cite web|url=http://www.woolor.com/thetechbook/countries-where-google-is-not-1-\nsearch-engine/ |title=thetechbook Â» Countries where Google is not #1
