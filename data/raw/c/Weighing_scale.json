{"cursor":"23261","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (reign 1605 - 1627) weighing his son Shah Jahan on a weighing scale by artist\n Manohar (AD 1615, Mughal dynasty, India).]] A 'weighing scale' (usually just\n \"scales\" in UK and Australian English, \"weighing machine\" in south Asian\n English or \"scale\" in US English) is a measuring instrument for determining the\n weight or mass of an object.\n\nA spring scale measures weight by the distance a spring deflects under its load.\nA balance compares the torque on the arm due to the sample weight to the torque\non the arm due to a standard reference weight using a horizontal lever. Balances\nare different from scales, in that a balance measures mass (or more specifically\ngravitational mass), where as a scale measures weight (or more specifically,\neither the tension or compression force of constraint provided by the scale).\nWeighing scales are used in many industrial and commercial applications, and\nproducts from feathers to loaded tractor-trailers are sold by weight.\nSpecialized medical scales and bathroom scales are used to measure the body\nweight of human beings.\n","linknr":631,"url":"Weighing_scale","recorded":1362568897,"links":84,"instances":["astrology","mathematics","physical","device","physics","ability","physics","structure","physics","mechanics"],"pdf":["http://www.isasc.org/Equilibrium/Back_Issues/2006-1.pdf","http://www.utoledo.edu/library/canaday/findingaids1/MSS-153.pdf","http://www.aandd.jp/support/materials/product_training1_balances.pdf","http://andrew.ucsd.edu/co2qc/handbook/sop21.pdf","http://www.nist.gov/calibrations/upload/nbs93-4.pdf"],"categories":["Weighing
