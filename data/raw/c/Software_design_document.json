An SDD\nusually accompanies an architecture diagram with pointers to detailed feature\nspecifications of smaller pieces of the design. Practically, a design document\nis required to coordinate a large team under a single vision. A design document\nneeds to be a stable reference, outlining all parts of the software and how they\nwill work. The document is commanded to give a fairly complete description,\nwhile maintaining a high-level view of the software.\n\nThere are two kinds of design documents called HLDD (high-level design document)\nand LLDD (low-level design document).\n","linknr":96,"url":"Software_design_document","recorded":1362688656,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Software documentation","Software design"],"headings":["Parts","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/System-installer.svg/30px-System-installer.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Software","Software_development","Data_object","Data_structures","Game_design_document"]}
