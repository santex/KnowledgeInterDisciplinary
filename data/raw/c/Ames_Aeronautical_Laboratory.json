Ames plays a role in many of NASA missions in support of\nAmerica's space and aeronautics programs. It provides leadership in\nastrobiology; small satellites; robotic lunar exploration; the search for\nhabitable planets; supercomputing; intelligent/adaptive systems; advanced\nthermal protection; and airborne astronomy. Ames also develops tools for a\nsafer, more efficient national airspace and unique partnerships benefiting\nNASAâs mission. The center's director is Dr. Simon P. \"Pete\" Worden (Brigadier\nGeneral, USAF retired).\n\nThe organisation is mission center for several key current missions ( Kepler\nMission, the Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission,\nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA)) and a major\ncontributor to the '\"new exploration focus'\" Showstack, R.
