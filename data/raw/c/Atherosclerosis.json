It is a syndrome affecting arterial\nblood vessels, a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, caused\nlargely by the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low-\ndensity lipoproteins (LDL, plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and\ntriglycerides) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the\nmacrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (see apoA-1 Milano).\nIt is commonly referred to as a hardening or furring of the arteries. It is\ncaused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries. {{cite book\n  | last = Maton first = Anthea authorlink = coauthors =Roshan L.

Arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening\n(and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries (from the Greek\n[[arteries|arteria]], meaning artery, and [[wikt:sclerosis|sclerosis]], meaning\nhardening); arteriolosclerosis is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of\narterioles (small arteries); atherosclerosis is a hardening of an artery\nspecifically due to an atheromatous plaque. The term atherogenic is used for\nsubstances or processes that cause atherosclerosis.\n\nAtherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for\ndecades. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques are\nseparated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called\nvulnerable). The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very\ncomplicated but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be\nasymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells, while,\nunstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and the extracellular\nmatrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous\ncap) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous\ncap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen  to the\ncirculation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen. Upon\nformation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (i.e. coronary\nocclusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation and eventually\nocclude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism (i.e. Stroke is\noften caused by thrombus formation in the carotid arteries). Apart from\nthromboembolism, chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause\ncomplete closure of the lumen. Interestingly, chronically expanding lesions are\noften asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply to\ndownstream tissue(s) is insufficient resulting in ischemia.\n\nThese complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive\nand cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable\nplaque), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop\nblood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately\n5 minutes. This catastrophic event is called an infarction. One of the most\ncommon recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery,\ncausing myocardial infarction (a heart attack). The same process in an artery\nto the brain is commonly called stroke. Another common scenario in very\nadvanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs,\ntypically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments\nnarrowed with clots.\n\nAtherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree, but mostly larger, high-pressure\nvessels such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries.\nThese are termed \"clinically silent\" because the person having the infarction\ndoes not notice the problem and does not seek medical help, or when they do,\nphysicians do not recognize what has happened.\n","linknr":1237,"url":"Atherosclerosis","recorded":1362505223,"links":81,"instances":["medicine","biology","anatomy","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/content/8qjl665766630k8p/fulltext.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/content/8qjl665766630k8p/fulltext.pdf","http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1992/pdf/1992-v07n01-p005.pdf","http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1992/pdf/1992-v07n01-p005.pdf","http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/14363927626049260973.pdf","http://journals2.scholarsportal.info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/tmp/14363927626049260973.pdf","https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/dspace/bitstream/1887/9729/11/01.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071127142751/https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/dspace/bitstream/1887/9729/11/01.pdf","https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/dspace/bitstream/1887/9729/11/01.pdf"],"categories":["Diseases
