{"cursor":"1437","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" at the level of the decussation of the pyramids.]] 'Decussation' is used in\n biological contexts to describe a crossing. (In Latin anatomical terms the form\n 'decussatio' is used, e.g. [[Decussation of pyramids|decussatio pyramidum]]) In\n anatomy the term chiasma or chiasm means much the same as\n decussation.

See for\n  example Decussation of pyramids.\n* In phyllotaxis when an opposite pattern of leaves has successive leaf pairs\n  that are perpendicular, it is called decussate. In effect, successive pairs of\n  leaves cross each other.\n* In tooth enamel, where bundles of rods cross each other as they travel from\n  the enamel-dentine junction to the outer enamel surface, or near to it.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Decussate","recorded":1362482749,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biology terminology"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gray688.png/200px-Gray688.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Crassula_rupestris-PICT3087.jpg/200px-Crassula_rupestris-PICT3087.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Gray188.png/32px-Gray188.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chiasm","Brain","Decussation_of_pyramids","Phyllotaxis","Opposite_leaves","Tooth_enamel","Commissure"]}
