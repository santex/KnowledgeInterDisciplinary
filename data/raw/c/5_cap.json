{"cursor":"5844","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In molecular biology, the '5â² cap' is a specially altered nucleotide on the 5â²\nend of precursor messenger RNA and some other primary RNA transcripts as found\nin eukaryotes. The process of 5â² capping is vital to creating mature messenger\nRNA, which is then able to undergo translation. Capping ensures the messenger\nRNA's stability while it undergoes translation in the process of protein\nsynthesis, and is a highly regulated process that occurs in the cell nucleus.\nBecause this only occurs in the nucleus, mitochondrial and chloroplast mRNA are\nnot capped.\n","linknr":230,"url":"5'_cap","recorded":1362374299,"links":26,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://www.ebc.ee/loengud/valgu_biosyntees_2007/Supplement_Eukaryotic_translation.pdf","http://www.ebc.ee/loengud/valgu_biosyntees_2007/Supplement_Eukaryotic_translation.pdf"],"categories":["RNA"],"headings":["5′ cap structure","Capping process","5′ capping targeting","5′ cap function","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/5%27_cap_structure.png/220px-5%27_cap_structure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Ribose_structure_2.png/220px-Ribose_structure_2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","genetics"],["translation","biology"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Nucleotide","5′_end","Precursor_messenger_RNA","Eukaryotes","Mature_messenger_RNA","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(genetics)","Protein_synthesis","Cell_nucleus","5′_end","Guanine","Triphosphate","Guanosine","Methylated","Transferase","7-Methylguanosine","Hydroxyl","Ribose","3′_end","Guanylyl_transferase","Capping_enzyme_complex","RNA_polymerase_II","Polyadenylation","RNA_polymerase_II","Exonucleases","Ribosome","Translation_(biology)","Cap_binding_complex","Nuclear_pore_complex","EIF-4E","EIF-4G","Half-life","P-bodies","Spliceosome","Messenger_RNA_decapping"]}
