{"cursor":"3609","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The term 'relative pitch' may denote:\n* the distance of a musical note from a set point of reference, e.g. \"three\n  octaves above middle C\"\n* a musician's ability to identify the intervals between given tones, regardless\n  of their relation to concert pitch (A = 440 Hz)\n* the skill used by singers to correctly sing a melody, following musical\n  notation, by pitching each note in the melody according to its distance from\n  the previous note. Alternatively, the same skill which allows someone to hear\n  a melody for the first time and name the notes relative to some known\n  reference pitch.\n* developed through intense training, practicing hearing differences between\n  major, minor, diminished, and augmented intervals\n\nThis last definition, which applies not only to singers but also to players of\ninstruments who rely on their own skill to determine the precise pitch of the\nnotes played (wind instruments, fretless string instruments like violin or\nviola, etc.), is an essential professional skill required to be able to play\nwith others. As an example think of the different concert pitches used by\norchestras playing music from different styles (a baroque orchestra with\noriginal instruments might decide to use a much lower pitch).\n\nUnlike absolute pitch (sometimes called \"perfect pitch\"), relative pitch is\nquite common among musicians, especially musicians who are used to \"playing by\near\", and a precise relative pitch is a constant characteristic among good\nmusicians. Also unlike perfect pitch, relative pitch is common among non-\nmusicians and can be developed through ear training. Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-\nsinging.pdf Learning to Sight-Sing: The Mental Mechanics of Aural Imagery.]\nMinneapolis: Thinking Applied, 2008, No. 1. Computer-aid ear training is\nbecoming a popular tool for musicians and music students and various software is\navailable for improving relative pitch.\n\nSome music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate\neach possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song. (See ear\ntraining.) Another method of developing relative pitch is playing melodies by\near on a musical instrument, especially one which, unlike a piano or other\nfingered instrument, requires a specific manual adjustment for each particular\ntone. Indian musicians learn relative pitch by singing intervals over a drone,\nwhich is also described by W. A. Mathieu using western just intonation\nterminology. Many western ear training classes use solfÃ¨ge to teach students\nrelative pitch, while others use numerical sight-singing.\n\nCompound intervals (intervals greater than an octave) can be more difficult to\ndetect than simple intervals (intervals less than an octave).\n\nInterval recognition may allow musicians to identify complex chord types, or to\naccurately tune an instrument with respect to a given reference tone, even if\nthe tone is not in concert pitch.\n\nRelative pitch has not been known to develop into absolute or perfect pitch.\nMost North American universities develop relative pitch in their ear training\ncourses. This can pose difficulties for students whose musicianship is more\ndependent on perfect pitch, although absolute and relative skills are not\nmutually exclusive.\n","linknr":126,"url":"Relative_pitch","recorded":1364118122,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Octave","/wiki/Middle_C","/wiki/Concert_pitch","/wiki/Musical_notation","/wiki/Ear_training#Functional_pitch_recognition","/wiki/Concert_pitch","/wiki/Absolute_pitch","/wiki/Ear_training","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Ear_training","/wiki/Drone_(music)","/wiki/W._A._Mathieu","/wiki/Just_intonation","/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge","/wiki/Numerical_sight-singing","/wiki/Concert_pitch","/wiki/Perfect_pitch","/wiki/Perfect_pitch","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Absolute_pitch","/wiki/Ear_training","/wiki/Tonal_memory","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","http://www.thinkingapplied.com/sight-singing_folder/sight-singing.pdf","/wiki/Template:Music_cognition","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Music_cognition&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Music_cognition&action=edit","/wiki/Music_cognition","/wiki/Biomusicology","/wiki/Bioacoustics","/wiki/Cognitive_musicology","/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience_of_music","/wiki/Music_psychology","/wiki/Psychoacoustics","/wiki/Zoomusicology","/wiki/File:PET-image.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/PET-image.jpg/80px-PET-image.jpg","/wiki/Absolute_pitch","/wiki/Culture_in_music_cognition","/wiki/Embodied_music_cognition","/wiki/Entrainment_(biomusicology)","/wiki/Levitin_effect","/wiki/Lipps%E2%80%93Meyer_law","/wiki/Melodic_expectation","/wiki/Music-related_memory","/wiki/Music-specific_disorders","/wiki/Amusia","/wiki/Beat_deafness","/wiki/Tone_deafness","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&oldid=540686580","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Music_cognition","/wiki/Category:Pitch_(music)","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relative+pitch&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Relative+pitch","/wiki/Relative_pitch","/wiki/Talk:Relative_pitch","#","/wiki/Relative_pitch","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Relative_pitch","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Relative_pitch","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&oldid=540686580","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Relative_pitch&id=540686580","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Relative+pitch","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Relative+pitch&oldid=540686580&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Relative_pitch&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativn%C3%AD_sluch","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%C3%ADdo_relativo","//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreille_relative","//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%99%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%D7%AA","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relatief_gehoor","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9B%B8%E5%AF%BE%E9%9F%B3%E6%84%9F","//no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativt_geh%C3%B8r","//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%82uch_relatywny","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Relative
