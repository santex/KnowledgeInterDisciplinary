{"cursor":"29276","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n in the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (1963).]]\n\nA 'stock trader' refers to a person or entity engaging in the trading of equity\nsecurities, in the capacity of agent, hedger, arbitrageur, speculator, or\ninvestor. The majority of stock traders are technically 'stock speculators',\nsynonym 'stockjobbers' (LSE). Stock speculators are often ambiguously referred\nto as stock traders in the public eye, usually to appear less intrusive, as\nsince the beginning of our capital markets, North America has a long and\ncolorful history of persecuting wall street speculators, simply for being\nspeculators . A 'stock investor' is an individual or firm who puts money to use\nby the purchase of equity securities, offering potential profitable returns, as\ninterest, income, or appreciation in value (capital gains). This buy-and-hold\nlong term strategy is passive in nature, as opposed to speculation, which is\ntypically active in nature. Many stock speculators will trade bonds (and\npossibly other financial assets) as well. Stock speculation is a risky and\ncomplex occupation because the direction of the markets are generally\nunpredictable and lack transparency, also financial regulators are sometimes\nunable to adequately detect, prevent and remediate irregularities committed by\nmalicious listed companies or other financial market participants. In addition,\nthe financial markets are usually subjected to speculation.\n","linknr":453,"url":"Stock_investors","recorded":1362484696,"links":26,"instances":["finance","finance","finance","trading","finance","economics","united_states","finance","finance","finance","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stock
