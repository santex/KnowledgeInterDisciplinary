Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), Oxford\nReference Online. Retrieved July 23, 2007. The central norms of this\ntradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common\npractice period.\n\nEuropean music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and popular\nmusical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th\ncentury. Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to\nthe performer the pitch, speed, meter, individual rhythms and exact execution of\na piece of music. This leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and\nad libitum ornamentation, that are frequently heard in non-European art music\nand popular music.\n\nThe term \"classical music\" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an\nattempt to \"canonize\" the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a\ngolden age. Rushton, Julian, Classical Music, (London, 1994), 10 The\nearliest reference to \"classical music\" recorded by the [[Oxford English\nDictionary]] is from about 1836.\n","linknr":1110,"url":"European_classical_music","recorded":1362480754,"links":122,"instances":["philosopher","music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music_critic","beethoven","music","music","music","tchaikovsky","music","music","sound","music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music","music"],"pdf":["http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf","http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf"],"categories":["European
