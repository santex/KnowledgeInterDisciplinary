{"cursor":"13150","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Protocol I' is a 1977 amendment protocol to the Geneva Conventions relating to\nthe protection of victims of international armed conflicts. It reaffirms the\ninternational laws of the original Geneva Conventions of 1949, but adds\nclarifications and new provisions to accommodate developments in modern\ninternational warfare that have taken place since the Second World War.\n\nAs of 11 May 2011, it had been ratified by 170 countries, with the\nUnited States, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Turkey being notable\nexceptions. However, the United States, Iran, and Pakistan signed it on 12\nDecember 1977 with the intention of ratifying it. According to an appeal by the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross in 1997, a number of the articles\ncontained in both protocols are recognized as rules of customary international\nlaw valid for all states, whether or not they have ratified them.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Protocol_I","recorded":1362567484,"links":21,"instances":["diplomacy"],"pdf":["http://www.supportgenevaconventions.info/library/geneva_conventions_summary.pdf","http://www.supportgenevaconventions.info/library/geneva_conventions_summary.pdf","http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Commentary_GC_Protocols.pdf","http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Commentary_GC_Protocols.pdf"],"categories":["Geneva
