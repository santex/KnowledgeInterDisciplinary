{"cursor":"16293","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn evolutionary biology, 'reciprocal altruism' is a behaviour whereby an\norganism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing\nanother organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will\nact in a similar manner at a later time. The concept was initially developed by\nRobert Trivers to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually\naltruistic acts. The concept is close to the strategy of \"tit for tat\" used in\ngame theory.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Reciprocal_altruism","recorded":1362480843,"links":28,"instances":["evolution"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Symbiosis","Evolutionary psychology","Altruism"],"headings":["Theory","Examples","Regulation by emotional disposition","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Reciprocal_altruism.jpg/240px-Reciprocal_altruism.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Cleaner_station_komodo.jpg/250px-Cleaner_station_komodo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/2012-06-09_16-04-22_Switzerland_Kanton_Graub%C3%BCnden_Sagliaz_cropped.JPG/220px-2012-06-09_16-04-22_Switzerland_Kanton_Graub%C3%BCnden_Sagliaz_cropped.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reciprocity","evolution"]],"members":["reciprocity"],"related":["Evolutionary_biology","Robert_Trivers","Tit_for_tat","Game_theory","Altruism","Prisonerâ€™s_dilemma","Tit_for_tat","Anatol_Rapoport","Wrasse","Animal_coloration","Cleaning_symbiosis","Cleaner_fish","Symbiosis","Vampire_bats","Kin_selection","Crab-eating_macaque","Vervet_monkey","Primates","Trivers","Altruism","Competitive_altruism","Psychological_egoism","Enlightened_self-interest","Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","Iterated_prisoner's_dilemma","Norm_of_reciprocity","Reciprocal_food_sharing","Reciprocity_(evolution)","Signalling_theory","Symbiosis","Tit_for_tat","Gift_economy"]}
