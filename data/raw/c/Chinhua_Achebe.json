Retrieved on 7 December 2010.\n[[Things Fall Apart]] (1958), which is the most widely read book in modern\nAfrican literature. Ogbaa, p. xv.\n\nRaised by his parents in the Igbo town of Ogidi in southeastern Nigeria, Achebe\nexcelled at school and won a scholarship for undergraduate studies. He became\nfascinated with world religions and traditional African cultures, and began\nwriting stories as a university student. After graduation, he worked for the\nNigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and soon moved to the metropolis of Lagos.\nHe gained worldwide attention for [[Things Fall Apart]] in the late 1950s; his\nlater novels include [[No Longer at Ease]] (1960), [[Arrow of God]] (1964), [[A\nMan of the People]] (1966), and [[Anthills of the Savannah]] (1987). Achebe\nwrites his novels in English and has defended the use of English, a \"language of\ncolonisers\", in African literature. In 1975, his lecture [[An Image of Africa:\nRacism in Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\"]] became the focus of controversy, for\nits criticism of Joseph Conrad as \"a bloody racist\" and was later published.\n\nWhen the region of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a\nsupporter of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador for the people of the\nnew nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took\nits toll, he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the\nNigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political\nparties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he\nwitnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and\nreturned to the U.S. in 1990 after a car accident left him partially disabled.\n\nAchebe's novels focus on the traditions of Igbo society, the effect of Christian\ninfluences, and the clash of Western and traditional African values during and\nafter the colonial era. His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and\ncombines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories,\nproverbs, and oratory. He has also published a number of short stories,\nchildren's books, and essay collections. Since 2009, he has been a professor at\nBrown University in the United States.\n","linknr":1094,"url":"Chinhua_Achebe","recorded":1362674554,"links":81,"instances":["book_publisher","poem","writer"],"pdf":["http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf","http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf"],"categories":["1930
