Though the photovoltaic effect is directly\nrelated to the photoelectric effect, they are different processes. When the\nsunlight or any other light is incident upon a material surface, the electrons\npresent in the valence band of the metallic atom absorbs energy and, being\nexcited, jump to the conduction band and become free. Now these free electrons\nare attracted by a positively charged electrode and thus the circuit completes\nand the light energy is converted into electric energy. In the photoelectric\neffect, electrons are ejected from a material's surface upon exposure to\nradiation. The photovoltaic effect differs in that electrons are transferred\nbetween different bands (i.e., from the valence to conduction bands within the\nmaterial), resulting in the buildup of voltage between two\nelectrodes.

In the case of a p-n junction solar cell,\nilluminating the material creates an electric current as excited electrons and\nthe remaining holes are swept in different directions by the built-in electric\nfield of the depletion region.
