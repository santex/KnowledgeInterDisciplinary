Initially, the primary role of REACT\nvolunteers was to monitor Channel 9, the CB Emergency Channel, to help\nmotorists. Later, duties grew to include communications after disasters\n(tornadoes, floods...), and in some places before disasters (storm spotting). As\nwell, REACT safety communications for parades, runs/walks and other community\nevents became prominent. Although some REACT Teams still use CB primarily, a\nlarge percentage have now added amateur, FRS, GMRS, Multi-Use Radio Service\n(MURS), Trunked radio systems and business band radio (LMR) to their public\nservice capabilities.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Radio_Emergency_Associated_Communication_Teams","recorded":1362559528,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Amateur radio emergency communications organizations","Emergency communication"],"headings":["Objectives","History","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Citizens'_band_radio","United_States","Canada","Tornadoes","Floods","Amateur_radio","Family_Radio_Service","GMRS","Multi-Use_Radio_Service","Trunked_radio_systems","Land_Mobile_Radio_System","Memorandum_of_Understanding"]}
