{"cursor":"17366","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Fluorescence spectroscopy' aka fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of\nelectromagnetic spectroscopy which analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It\ninvolves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the\nelectrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light;\ntypically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is\nabsorption spectroscopy.\n\nDevices that measure fluorescence are called fluorometers or fluorimeters.\n","linknr":207,"url":"Fluorescence_spectroscopy","recorded":1362671529,"links":25,"instances":["biology","physics","physics","fluorescence"],"pdf":["http://content.piacton.com/Uploads/Princeton/Documents/Library/UpdatedLibrary/Time_resolved_fluorescence_spectroscopy.pdf"],"categories":["Spectroscopy","Fluorescence"],"headings":["Theory","Instrumentation","Analysis of data","Tryptophan fluorescence","Applications","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intensity","physics"],["virtual_state","physics"],["quenching","fluorescence"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","virtual_state","intensity","quenching"],"related":["Electromagnetic_spectroscopy","Fluorescence","Ultraviolet_light","Molecules","Visible_light","Absorption_spectroscopy","Fluorescence","Fluorometer","Energy_levels","Stationary_state","Photon","Jablonski_diagram","Monochromator","Filter_fluorometer","Fluorescence","Spectrofluorometer","Diffraction_grating","Monochromator","Xenon_arc_lamp","Mercury-vapor_lamp","Collimated","Stray_light","Fluorescence","Intensity_(physics)","Concentration","Fluorophore","Virtual_State_(physics)","Fluorescence","Folded_protein","Tryptophan","Solvatochromic","Quenching_(fluorescence)","Tryptophan","Surfactant","Amphiphilic","Vesicle_(biology)","Micelle","Fluorophore","Tyrosine","Phenylalanine","Organic_compound","CVAFS","Fluorescent_solar_collector","Microfluorimetry"]}
