Cone cells are\ndensely packed in the fovea, but quickly reduce in number towards the periphery\nof the retina.\n\nA commonly cited figure of six million in the human eye was found by Osterberg\nin 1935. G. Osterberg (1935). âTopography of the layer of\nrods and cones in the human retina,â Acta Ophthalmol., Suppl. 13:6, pp.\n1â102. Oyster's textbook (1999) cites work by Curcio et al.\n(1990) indicating an average close to 4.5 million cone cells and 90 million rod\ncells in the human retina.\n\nCones are less sensitive to light than the rod cells in the retina (which\nsupport vision at low light levels), but allow the perception of colour. They\nare also able to perceive finer detail and more rapid changes in images, because\ntheir response times to stimuli are faster than those of rods. {{cite book\n | first = E.R. last = Kandel authorlink = coauthors = Schwartz, J.H, and\n | Jessell, T.

Being colour blind can\nchange this, and there have been some unverified reports of people with four or\nmore types of cones, giving them tetrachromatic vision. {{cite journal |doi=10.3758/BF03196159 |author=Jameson, K.
