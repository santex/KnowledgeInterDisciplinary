{"cursor":"1658","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] An 'explosion crater' is a characteristically shaped hole formed when\nmaterial is ejected from the surface of the ground by an explosive event just\nabove, at, or below the surface.\n\nA crater is formed by an explosive event through the displacement and ejection\nof material from the ground. It is typically bowl-shaped. High pressure gas and\npressure waves are responsible for the creation of the crater by three processes\n* plastic deformation of the ground\n* projection of material (ejecta) from the ground by the expansion of gases in\n  the ground\n* spallation of the ground surface and two processes partially fill it back in\n* fall-back of ejecta\n* erosion and landslides of the crater lip and wall P. W.\n  Cooper Explosives Engineering Wiley-VCH ISBN 0-471-18636-8 The relative\n  importance of the five processes varies depending on the height above or depth\n  below the ground surface at which the explosion occurs, and the material\n  composing the ground.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Explosion_crater","recorded":1362900474,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Craters"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Sedan_Plowshare_Crater.jpg/200px-Sedan_Plowshare_Crater.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Stylised_crater.png/400px-Stylised_crater.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg/35px-Operation_Upshot-Knothole_-_Badger_001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ejecta","Spallation","Maar","Subsidence_crater","Impact_crater","Pseudocrater"]}
