Activation energy may also be defined as the\nminimum energy required to start a chemical reaction. The activation energy of\na reaction is usually denoted by E a and given in units of\nkilojoules per mole.\n\nActivation energy can be thought of as the height of the potential barrier\n(sometimes called the energy barrier) separating two minima of potential energy\n(of the reactants and products of a reaction). For a chemical reaction to\nproceed at a reasonable rate, there should exist an appreciable number of\nmolecules with energy equal to or greater than the activation energy.\n\nAt a more advanced level, the Arrhenius Activation energy term from the\nArrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter\nthat indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature. There are\ntwo objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier\nfor an elementary reaction. First, it is often unclear as to whether or not\nreaction does proceed in one step; threshold barriers that are averaged out over\nall elementary steps have little theoretical value. Second, even if the reaction\nbeing studied is elementary, a spectrum of individual collisions contributes to\nrate constants obtained from bulk ('bulb') experiments involving billions of\nmolecules, with many different reactant collision geometries and angles,\ndifferent translational and (possibly) vibrational energies - all of which may\nlead to different microscopic reaction rates.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Activation_energy","recorded":1362504637,"links":50,"instances":["chemistry","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical kinetics","Catalysis"],"headings":["Negative activation energy","Temperature independence and the relation to the Arrhenius equation","Catalysis","Relationship with Gibbs free energy","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Incandescence.jpg/180px-Incandescence.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/b/fcbf7210f17816323cc867b46eb5ce9e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Activation_energy.svg/360px-Activation_energy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/0/6/706147204f35ca44a72fd767aab6fa6e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/9/bf94b730e5f5bdb307fadc75a9a1d281.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cross_section","physics"],["frequency_factor","chemistry"]],"members":["frequency_factor","cross_section"],"related":["Bunsen_burner","Chemistry","Svante_Arrhenius","Chemical_reaction","Joule_per_mole","Potential_barrier","Minima","Potential_energy","Cross_section_(physics)","Arrhenius_equation","Frequency_factor_(chemistry)","Gas_constant","Kelvin","Reaction_rate_constant","Reaction_coordinate","Catalyst","Biology","Enzyme","Arrhenius_equation","Reaction_coordinate","Eyring_equation","Gibbs_free_energy","Transition_state","Arrhenius_equation","Chemical_kinetics","Quantum_tunnelling","Mean_kinetic_temperature"]}
