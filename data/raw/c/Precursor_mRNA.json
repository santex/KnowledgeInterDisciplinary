The term hnRNA is often used as a synonym for pre-mRNA,\nalthough, in the strict sense, hnRNA may include nuclear RNA transcripts that do\nnot end up as cytoplasmic mRNA.\n\nOnce pre-mRNA has been completely processed, it is termed \"mature messenger\nRNA\", \"mature mRNA\", or simply \"mRNA\".\n","linknr":276,"url":"Precursor_mRNA","recorded":1362373852,"links":29,"instances":["genetics","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","RNA","Spliceosome"],"headings":["Processing","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Diagram_human_cell_nucleus_no_text.png/30px-Diagram_human_cell_nucleus_no_text.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["splicing","genetics"],["translation","biology"]],"members":["splicing","translation","transcription"],"related":["Post-transcriptional_modification","MRNA","DNA","Cell_nucleus","Transcription_(genetics)","Messenger_RNA","Eukaryote","Exon","Intron","Splicing_(genetics)","Spliceosome","Post-transcriptional_modification","5'_end","3'_end","5'_cap","7-methylguanosine","Poly-A_tail","SnRNP","Translation_(biology)","Ribosome","Prokaryota"]}
