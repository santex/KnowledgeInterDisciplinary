Population\ndynamics deals with the way populations are affected by birth and death rates,\nand by immigration and emigration, and studies topics such as ageing populations\nor population decline.\n\nOne common mathematical model for population dynamics is the exponential growth\nmodel. With the exponential model, the rate of change\nof any given population is proportional to the already existing population.\n","linknr":181,"url":"Population_dynamics","recorded":1362484661,"links":28,"instances":["biophysical","population"],"pdf":["http://docserver.esa.catchword.org/deliver/cw/pdf/esa/freepdfs/0046225x/v34n4s26.pdf"],"categories":["Demography","Fisheries science","Population","Population ecology","Sociodynamics"],"headings":["History","Fisheries and wildlife management","Intrinsic rate of increase","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Jellyfish_population_trends_by_LME.jpg/275px-Jellyfish_population_trends_by_LME.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/c/c6c7fa7edffa42225a29149c2f8a44c1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["environment","biophysical"],["overshoot","population"]],"members":["environment","overshoot"],"related":["Life_sciences","Population","Biology","Environment_(biophysical)","Birth_rate","Death_rate","Immigration","Emigration","Ageing_population","Population_decline","Mathematical_biology","Malthus","Malthusian_growth_model","Demography","Benjamin_Gompertz","Pierre_François_Verhulst","F.J._Richards","Simon_Hopkins","Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy","Lotka–Volterra_equation","Computer_game","MMORPG","Ultima_Online","Computer_simulation","Evolutionary_game_theory","John_Maynard_Smith","Mathematical_modelling_in_epidemiology","Fisheries","Wildlife_management","Birth_rate","Population_growth_rate","Mortality_rate","Minimum_viable_population","Maximum_sustainable_yield","Nicholson-Bailey_model","Nurgaliev's_law","Overshoot_(population)","Population_cycle","Population_ecology","Population_genetics","Population_modeling","Ricker_model","Sigmoid_curve","Societal_collapse","System_dynamics","Andrey_Korotayev","Peter_Turchin"]}
