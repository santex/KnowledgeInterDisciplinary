{"cursor":"27153","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\n or soil, and firing it (around 1890)]]\n\n'Charcoal' is a light black residue consisting of carbon, and any remaining ,\nobtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from animal and\nvegetation substances. Charcoal is usually produced by slow pyrolysis, the\nheating of wood or other substances in the absence of oxygen (see pyrolysis,\nchar and biochar). It is usually an impure form of carbon as it contains ash;\nhowever, sugar 'charcoal' is among the purest forms of carbon readily available,\nparticularly if it is not made by heating but by a dehydration reaction with\nsulfuric acid to minimise introducing new impurities, as impurities can be\nremoved from the sugar in advance. The resulting soft, brittle, lightweight,\nblack, porous material resembles coal.\n","linknr":529,"url":"Charcoal","recorded":1362375678,"links":82,"instances":["material","charcoal","chemistry","chemistry","england","drawing","fuel","drawing"],"pdf":["http://www.jci-plant.or.jp/010jci/pdf/H21_PI-1-malaysia-B-Report.pdf","http://www.jci-plant.or.jp/010jci/pdf/H21_PI-1-malaysia-B-Report.pdf","http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf","http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-6.pdf"],"categories":["Art
