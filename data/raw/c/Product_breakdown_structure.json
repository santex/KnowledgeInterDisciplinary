{"cursor":"2225","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]]\n\nIn project management, a 'product breakdown structure' (PBS) is a tool for\nanalysing, documenting and communicating the outcomes of a project, and forms\npart of the product based planning technique.\n\nThe PBS provides an exhaustive, hierarchical tree structure of deliverables\n(physical, functional or conceptual) that make up the project, arranged in whole-\npart relationship.\n\nThis diagrammatic representation of project outputs provides a clear and\nunambiguous statement of what the project is to deliver.\n\nThe PBS is identical in format to the work breakdown structure (WBS), but is a\nseparate entity and is used at a different step in the planning process. The PBS\nprecedes the WBS and focuses on cataloguing all the desired outcomes (products)\nneeded to achieve the goal of the project. This feeds into creation of the WBS,\nwhich identifies the tasks and activities required to deliver those outcomes.\nSupporters of product based planning suggest that this overcomes difficulties\nthat arise from assumptions about what to do and how to do it by focusing\ninstead on the goals and objectives of the project - an oft-quoted analogy is\nthat PBS defines where you want to go, the WBS tells you how to get there.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Product_breakdown_structure","recorded":1362476886,"links":13,"instances":["project_management"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Project management","Product management","Management","Production and manufacturing","PRINCE2"],"headings":["Example","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Product_Breakdown_Structure_example.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","business"],["product","project_management"]],"members":["product"],"related":["Project_management","Product_based_planning","Tree_structure","Deliverable","Work_breakdown_structure","List_of_fastest-selling_products","List_of_project_management_topics","Product_(business)","Product_(project_management)","Product_description","Product_management","Production,_costs,_and_pricing","Project_management","Work_breakdown_structure"]}
