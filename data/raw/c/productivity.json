{"cursor":"65487","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Productivity' is an average measure of the efficiency of production.\nProductivity is a ratio of production output to what is required to produce it\n(inputs of capital, labor, land, energy, materials, etc.). The measure of\nproductivity is defined as a total output per one unit of a total input. We see\nthat as a measure of the average productivity is often difficult to interpret\ncorrectly.\n\nThese definitions are short but too general and insufficient to make the\nphenomenon productivity understandable. A more detailed theory of productivity\nis needed, which explains the phenomenon productivity and makes it\ncomprehensible. In order to obtain a measurable form of productivity,\noperationalization of the concept is necessary. In explaining and\noperationalizing a set of production models are used. A production model is a\nnumerical expression of the production process that is based on production data,\ni.e. measured data in the form of prices and quantities of inputs and outputs.\n\nIt is advisable to examine any phenomenon whatsoever only after defining the\nentity the phenomenon under review forms part of. Hence, productivity cannot be\nexamined as a phenomenon independently but it is necessary to identify the\nentity it belongs to. Such an entity is defined as production process and its\nability to generate incomes.\n\nThe benefits of high productivity are manifold. At the national level,\nproductivity growth raises living standards because more real income improves\npeople's ability to purchase goods and services, enjoy leisure, improve housing\nand education and contribute to social and environmental programs. Productivity\ngrowth is important to the firm because more real income means that the firm can\nmeet its (perhaps growing) obligations to customers, suppliers, workers,\nshareholders, and governments (taxes and regulation), and still remain\ncompetitive or even improve its competitiveness in the market\nplace.
