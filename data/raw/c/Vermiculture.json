{"cursor":"36779","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Compost' ( or ) is organic matter that has been decomposed and recycled as a\nfertilizer and soil amendment. Compost is a key ingredient in organic farming.\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting simply requires making a heap\nof wetted organic matter (leaves, \"green\" food waste) and waiting for the\nmaterials to break down into humus after a period of weeks or months. Modern,\nmethodical composting is a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured\ninputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The decomposition\nprocess is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper\naeration by regularly turning the mixture. Worms and fungi further break up the\nmaterial. Aerobic bacteria manage the chemical process by converting the inputs\ninto heat, carbon dioxide and ammonium. The ammonium is further converted by\nbacteria into plant-nourishing nitrites and nitrates through the process of\nnitrification.\n\nCompost can be rich in nutrients. It is used in gardens, landscaping,\nhorticulture, and agriculture. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in\nmany ways, including as a soil conditioner, a fertilizer, addition of vital\nhumus or humic acids, and as a natural pesticide for soil. In ecosystems,\ncompost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland\nconstruction, and as landfill cover (see compost uses). Organic ingredients\nintended for composting can alternatively be used to generate biogas through\nanaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion is fast overtaking composting in some\nparts of the world including central Europe as a primary means of downcycling\nwaste organic matter.\n","linknr":746,"url":"Vermiculture","recorded":1362508823,"links":64,"instances":["material","composting_over_unwanted_plants"],"pdf":["http://esa.un.org/iys/docs/san_lib_docs/ESR2web%5B1%5D.pdf","http://doku.b.tu-harburg.de/volltexte/2009/557/pdf/PhD_Thesis_Winker.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf","http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf","http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf","http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf","http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd43/korner.pdf"],"categories":["Composting|","Organic
