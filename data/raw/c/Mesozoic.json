{"cursor":"17215","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'Mesozoic Era' is an interval of geological time from about 250 million\nyears ago to about 65 million years ago. It is often referred to as the 'Age of\nReptiles' because reptiles, namely non-avian dinosaurs, were the dominant\nterrestrial and marine vertebrates of the time.\n\nMesozoic means \"middle life\", deriving from the Greek prefix meso-/Î¼ÎµÏÎ¿- for\n\"between\" and zÅon/Î¶ÏÎ¿Î½ meaning \"animal\" or \"living being\". It is one of three\ngeologic eras of the Phanerozoic Eon, preceded by the Paleozoic (\"ancient life\")\nand succeeded by the Cenozoic (\"new life\"). The era is subdivided into three\nmajor periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous, which are further\nsubdivided into a number of epochs and stages.\n\nThe era began in the wake of the Permian-Triassic event, the largest mass\nextinction in Earth's history, and ended with the CretaceousâPaleogene\nextinction event, another mass extinction which is known for having killed off\nnon-avian dinosaurs, as well as other plant and animal species. The Mesozoic\nwas a time of significant tectonic, climate and evolutionary activity. The era\nwitnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate\nlandmasses that would eventually move into their current positions. The\nclimate of the Mesozoic was varied, alternating between warming and cooling\nperiods. Overall, however, the Earth was hotter than it is today. Non-avian\ndinosaurs appeared in the Mid-Triassic and became the dominant terrestrial\nvertebrates early in the Jurassic, occupying this position for about 135\nmillion years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous. Birds first\nappeared in the Jurassic, having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs.\nThe first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic, but would remain small\nand modest until the Cenozoic.\n","linknr":596,"url":"Mesozoic","recorded":1362372858,"links":77,"instances":["sediment","geology","geology","genus"],"pdf":["http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Geological history of Earth","Mesozoic|"],"headings":["Geologic periods","Paleogeography and tectonics","Climate","Life","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Conguillio_llaima.jpg/220px-Conguillio_llaima.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Europasaurus_holgeri_Scene_2.jpg/220px-Europasaurus_holgeri_Scene_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["eon","geology"],["period","geology"],["deposition","sediment"],["sequoia","genus"]],"members":["deposition","eon","period","sequoia"],"related":["Dinosaurs","Ancient_Greek","Animal","Geologic_time_scale","Phanerozoic","Eon_(geology)","Paleozoic","Cenozoic","Triassic","Jurassic","Cretaceous","Permian-Triassic_event","Mass_extinction","Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event","Dinosaur","Pangaea","Dinosaur","Evolution_of_birds","Theropoda","Mammal","Period_(geology)","Triassic","Jurassic","Cretaceous","Permian-Triassic_extinction_event","Extinction","Great_Dying","Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event","Chicxulub_Crater","Yucatán_Peninsula","Bird","Orogeny","Arctic","Innuitian_orogeny","Brooks_Range","Verkhoyansk_Range","Cherskiy_Range","Khingan_Mountains","Arctic_Ocean","North_China_Craton","Supercontinent","Pangaea","Laurasia","Gondwana","Passive_continental_margin","Atlantic","East_Coast_of_the_United_States","Laurasia","North_America","Eurasia","Gondwana","South_America","Africa","Australia","Antarctica","South_Asia","Asia","Himalaya","Carboniferous","Specific_heat_capacity","Water","Ocean","Desert","Red_beds","Halite","Carnian_Pluvial_Event","Rhaetian","Triassic-Jurassic_extinction_event","Seafloor_spreading","Tethys_Ocean","Humidity","Carbon_dioxide","Earth's_atmosphere","Temperature_gradient","Celsius","Oxygen","Decomposition","Deposition_(sediment)","Oil_shale","Polar_ice_cap","Glacier","Nature_Geosciences","Cenozoic","Gymnosperm","Angiosperm","Ginkgo_biloba","Extant_taxon","Sequoia_(genus)","Permian","Adaptive_radiation","Herbivore","Carnivore","Dinocephalia","Ecological_niche","Cynodont","Dicynodont","Animal","Archosaur","Reptile","Dinosaur","Pterosaur","Ichthyosaur","Plesiosaur","Mosasaur","Bird","Eutheria","Flowering_plant","Tropics","Biomass","Cycad","Fern","Insect","Anatomy","Mouth","Lizard","Snake","Primate","Cenozoic","Paleozoic","Precambrian"]}
