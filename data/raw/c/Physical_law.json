The production of a\nsummary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental\naim of science. These terms are not used the same way by all authors.\n\nThe distinction between natural law in the political-legal sense and law of\nnature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts\nbeing equally derived from [[physis]], the Greek word (translated into Latin as\nnatura) for nature. Some modern philosophers, e.g. Norman Swartz, use\n\"physical law\" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are\ninferred by scientists.
