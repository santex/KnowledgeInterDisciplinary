{"cursor":"10126","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n (1557).]]\n\nAn 'equation', in a mathematical context, is generally understood to mean a\nmathematical statement that asserts the equality of two\nexpressions. {{cite web\n| url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/equation title = Equation work =\n| Dictionary.com publisher = Dictionary.com, LLC accessdate = 2009-11-24\n}} In modern notation, this is written by placing the expressions on\neither side of an equals sign (=), for example\n: x + 3 = 5\\,\nasserts that x+3 is equal to 5. The = symbol was invented by Robert Recorde\n(1510â1558), who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel\nstraight lines with the same length.\n\nCenturies ago, the word \"equation\" frequently meant what we now usually call\n\"correction\" or \"adjustment\". This meaning is still occasionally found,\nespecially in names which were originally given long ago. The \"equation of\ntime\", for example, is a correction that must be applied to the reading of a\nsundial in order to obtain mean time, as would be shown by a clock.\n","linknr":297,"url":"Mathematical_equation","recorded":1362484642,"links":100,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary algebra","Equations|"],"headings":["Knowns and unknowns","Analogous illustration","Types of equations","Identities","Properties","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Translation_to_english_arrow.svg/50px-Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/First_Equation_Ever.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/c/a/3ca433e1a60a394891f56c80ec62812a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Equation_illustration.svg/220px-Equation_illustration.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/d/9/dd90a95574cb225baca4251d3aef82c0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/e/9/3e9e786b7609e226ea96632d10b2bf06.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/1/e11729b0b65ecade3fc272548a3883fc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/2/5/a255512f9d61a6777bd5a304235bd26d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/6/5/b652be9a498a412deec88870878073f7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/a/faae1e93b6da11bb4eeff5efb52e9bb8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/1/e11729b0b65ecade3fc272548a3883fc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/2/5/a255512f9d61a6777bd5a304235bd26d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/e/43ec3e5dee6e706af7766fffea512721.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/e/f/2ef0deb28c4bbc1ce6c11e4cce7e75b1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/e/d7e775795704c51c4e3f0499cb06b5a4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/a/2/6a267007228f9f654a0d28dec6932c31.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/1/e11729b0b65ecade3fc272548a3883fc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/6/3/96306356222d37c99c3801ee6ae69670.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/a/3/9a32e1ebb0b915dd3b0f4e413ef7f3f4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/d/0ed775167e5c7887ef5b798190d3ed1b.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["proposition","mathematics"],["equality","mathematics"],["expression","mathematics"],["inequality","mathematics"],["operation","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["identity","mathematics"],["constant","mathematics"],["variable","mathematics"],["division","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["0","number"],["product","mathematics"],["term","mathematics"],["expression","mathematics"],["inequality","mathematics"]],"members":["equality","variable","function","division","constant","term","identity","expression","proposition","product","operation","inequality","field"],"related":["Mathematics","Proposition_(mathematics)","Equality_(mathematics)","Expression_(mathematics)","Equals_sign","Robert_Recorde","Equation_of_time","Local_mean_time","Equation_solving","Simultaneous_equations","Weighing_scale","Seesaw","Inequality_(mathematics)","Real_numbers","Operation_(mathematics)","Algebraic_equation","Polynomial","Degree_of_a_polynomial","Linear_equation","Quadratic_equation","Cubic_equation","Quartic_equation","Quintic_equation","Diophantine_equation","Integer","Indeterminate_equation","Transcendental_equation","Functional_equation","Function_(mathematics)","Differential_equation","Derivative","Integral_equation","Integral","Parametric_equation","Parameter","Identity_(mathematics)","Equation_solving","Constant_(mathematics)","Variable_(mathematics)","René_Descartes","Elementary_algebra","Addition","Subtraction","Multiplication","Division_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","Extraneous_solution","Extraneous_solution","Congruence_relation","Field_(mathematics)","Real_numbers","Natural_number","Integers","Integral_domain","Inverse_operator","Injective","Logical_conditional","Logical_biconditional","0_(number)","Product_(mathematics)","Dot_product","Term_(mathematics)","Expression_(mathematics)","Formula_editor","Functional_equation","History_of_elementary_algebra","Inequality_(mathematics)","Inequation","List_of_equations","Scientific_equations_named_after_people","Theory_of_equations","Algebra"]}
