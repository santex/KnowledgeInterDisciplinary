{"cursor":"4049","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Organic acidemia', also called 'organic aciduria', is a term used to classify a\ngroup of metabolic disorders which disrupt normal amino acid metabolism,\nparticularly branched-chain amino acids, causing a buildup of acids which are\nusually not present.\n\nThe branched-chain amino acids include isoleucine, leucine and valine. Organic acids refer to the amino acids and certain odd-chained\nfatty acids which are affected by these disorders.\n\nThe four main types of organic acidemia are: methylmalonic acidemia, propionic\nacidemia, isovaleric acidemia, and maple syrup urine disease.\n","linknr":312,"url":"Organic_aciduria","recorded":1362503057,"links":13,"instances":["biology","anatomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Amino acid metabolism disorders"],"headings":["Diagnosis and Symptoms","Cause","Treatment","External links","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","anatomy"],["human_development","biology"]],"members":["human_development","organ"],"related":["Inborn_error_of_metabolism","Amino_acid_metabolism","Branched-chain_amino_acids","Isoleucine","Leucine","Valine","Organic_acid","Amino_acid","Fatty_acid","Methylmalonic_acidemia","Propionic_acidemia","Isovaleric_acidemia","Maple_syrup_urine_disease","Organic_acid","Urine_organic_acids","Gas_chromatography-mass_spectrometry","Newborn_screening","Prognosis","Organ_(anatomy)","Central_nervous_system","Developmental_delay","Poor_feeding","Human_development_(biology)","Lethargy","Vomiting","Dehydration","Malnutrition","Hypoglycemia","Hypotonia","Metabolic_acidosis","Ketoacidosis","Hyperammonemia","Death","Autosome","Gene","Enzyme","Metabolism","Autosomal_recessive","Protein","Carbohydrate","Intravenous_fluid","Anabolism"]}
