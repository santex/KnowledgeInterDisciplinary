{"cursor":"7151","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Specific absorption rate' (SAR) is a measure of the rate at which energy is\nabsorbed by the body when exposed to a radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic\nfield; although, it can also refer to absorption of other forms of energy by\ntissue, including ultrasound. For example see\nhttp://asadl.org/jasa/resource/1/jasman/v104/i3/p1705_s1 It is defined as\nthe power absorbed per mass of tissue and has units of watts per kilogram\n(W/kg). SAR is usually averaged either over the whole body, or over a\nsmall sample volume (typically 1 g or 10 g of tissue). The value cited\nis then the maximum level measured in the body part studied over the stated\nvolume or mass.\n","linknr":155,"url":"Specific_absorption_rate","recorded":1362375131,"links":35,"instances":["physics","electromagnetic_radiation"],"pdf":["http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf","http://www.icnirp.org/documents/emfgdl.pdf","http://www.ets-lindgren.com/pdf/sar_lo.pdf","http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_4_important_product_information_guide.pdf"],"categories":["Radiobiology","Biophysics"],"headings":["Calculation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/6/5261e45213247d6102dcc64748aae51f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/4/9d43cb8bbcb702e9d5943de477f099e2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/a/3/3a3ea00cfc35332cedf6e5e9a32e94da.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/f/f7f177957cf064a93e9811df8fe65ed1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","electromagnetic_radiation"],["power","physics"]],"members":["power","absorption"],"related":["Energy","Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Radio_frequency","Electromagnetic_field","Power_(physics)","Mass","Body_tissue","Watt","Kilogram","Electric_field","Electrical_conductivity","Root_mean_square","Density","Mobile_phones","MRI","United_States","Federal_Communications_Commission","Watt","Kilogram","European_Union","CENELEC","International_Electrotechnical_Commission","Mobile_Phones_SAR_List","Dielectric_heating","Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health","Electromagnetic_radiation_and_health"]}
