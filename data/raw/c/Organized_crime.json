{"cursor":"103740","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n American mobster Al Capone, a figure often associated with the topic of\n organised crime.]]\n\n\n'Organised crime' or 'criminal organisations' are transnational, national, or\nlocal groupings of highly centralised enterprises run by criminals for the\npurpose of engaging in illegal activity, most commonly for monetary profit. Some\ncriminal organisations, such as terrorist organisations, are politically\nmotivated. Sometimes criminal organisations force people to do business with\nthem, as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for so-called\n\"protection\". Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian\nEd. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 206. Gangs may become\ndisciplined enough to be considered organised. An organised gang or criminal set\ncan also be referred to as a 'mob'. [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mob?q=mob], Definition of\nMob in the Oxford Dictionary online, see meaning 2.\n\nIn the United States, the [[Organized Crime Control Act]] (1970) defines\norganised crime as \"The unlawful activities of [...] a highly organised,\ndisciplined association [...]\". [http://www.atf.gov/pub/fire-\nexplo_pub/xcomplete.htm ] Criminal activity as a structured group is\nreferred to as racketeering and such crime is commonly referred to as the work\nof the Mob. In the UK, police estimate organised crime involves up to 38,000\npeople operating in 6,000 various groups.

violence of Mexico's drug war, the Mexican drug cartels are\nconsidered the \"greatest organised crime threat to the United States\" according\nto a report issued by the United States Department of
