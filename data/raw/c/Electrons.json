It is generally thought to\nbe an elementary particle. An electron has a mass that is\napproximately 1/1836 that of the proton. The\nintrinsic angular momentum (spin) of the electron is a half-integer value in\nunits of ''Ä§'', which means that it is a fermion. The antiparticle of the\nelectron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except that it\ncarries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign. When an electron\ncollides with a positron, both particles may be totally annihilated, producing\ngamma ray photons.\n\nElectrons, which belong to the first generation of the lepton particle\nfamily, participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and\nweak interactions. {{cite book\n | last = Anastopoulos | first = C. year = 2008 title = Particle Or Wave: The\n | Evolution of the Concept of Matter in Modern Physics url =\n | http://books.google.com/?id=rDEvQZhpltEC&pg=PA236 pages = 236â237 publisher =\n | Princeton University Press isbn = 0-691-13512-6\n}} Like all matter, they have quantum mechanical properties of both\nparticles and waves, so they can collide with other particles and can be\ndiffracted like light. However, this duality is best demonstrated in experiments\nwith electrons, due to their tiny mass. Since an electron is a fermion, no two\nelectrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli\nexclusion principle.\n\nThe concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge was theorized to\nexplain the chemical properties of atoms, beginning in 1838 by British natural\nphilosopher Richard Laming; the name electron was\nintroduced for this charge in 1894 by Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney.\nThe electron was identified as a particle in 1897 by J. J. Thomson and his team\nof British physicists.\n\nIn many physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, and thermal\nconductivity, electrons play an essential role. An electron in motion relative\nto an observer generates a magnetic field, and will be deflected by external\nmagnetic fields. When an electron is accelerated, it can absorb or radiate\nenergy in the form of photons. Electrons, together with atomic nuclei made of\nprotons and neutrons, make up atoms. However, electrons contribute less than\n0.06% to an atom's total mass. The attractive Coulomb force between an electron\nand a proton causes electrons to be bound into atoms. The exchange or sharing of\nthe electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical\nbonding.\n\nElectrons may be created through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-\nenergy collisions, for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. Electrons\nmay be destroyed through annihilation with positrons, and may be absorbed during\nnucleosynthesis in stars. Laboratory instruments are capable of containing and\nobserving individual electrons as well as electron plasma, whereas dedicated\ntelescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons have many\napplications, including in electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron\nmicroscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and\nparticle accelerators.\n","linknr":2257,"url":"Electrons","recorded":1362375193,"links":183,"instances":["microbiology","accelerator","physics","wave_propagation","journal","algebra","particle","physicist","electronics","journal","mathematics","physics","physics","chemistry","astronomer","journal","quantum_mechanics","electricity","physics","physics","particle_physics","physics","particle_physics","physics","thermodynamics","journal","physics"],"pdf":["http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/thomson-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1906/thomson-lecture.pdf","http://ufn.ru/ufn60/ufn60_10/Russian/r6010e.pdf","http://ufn.ru/ufn60/ufn60_10/Russian/r6010e.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/bohr-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/bohr-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1929/broglie-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1929/broglie-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1937/davisson-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1937/davisson-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/dirac-lecture.pdf","http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/dirac-lecture.pdf","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/beamline/27/1/27-1-panofsky.pdf","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/beamline/27/1/27-1-panofsky.pdf","http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/listings/rpp2012-list-electron.pdf","http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/listings/rpp2012-list-electron.pdf","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/beamline/26/1/26-1-sather.pdf","http://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/beamline/26/1/26-1-sather.pdf","http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/166.pdf","http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/166.pdf","http://www.atto.fysik.lth.se/video/pressrelen.pdf","http://www.atto.fysik.lth.se/video/pressrelen.pdf","http://www.atto.fysik.lth.se/publications/papers/MauritssonPRL2008.pdf","http://www.atto.fysik.lth.se/publications/papers/MauritssonPRL2008.pdf"],"categories":["Electron|","Leptons","Quantum
