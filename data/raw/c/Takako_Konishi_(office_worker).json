{"cursor":"2832","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Takako Konishi' (1973?â€“2001) was an office worker from Tokyo, who was\nfound dead in a snowy field outside of Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, on November 15,\n2001. Konishi had originally arrived in Minneapolis earlier that month, traveled\nto Bismarck, then to Fargo, and finally to Detroit Lakes, where she died. Her\ndeath was ruled a suicide, but it was insinuated by the media that she had died\ntrying to locate the money hidden by Steve Buscemi's character, Carl Showalter,\nin the film [[Fargo (film)|Fargo]], under the impression that the film was based\non a true story. The events depicted in Fargo, however, are fictional.\n\nInvestigations by American film writer/director Paul Berczeller discovered the\nentire Fargo story had come about as the result of a misunderstanding between\nKonishi and one of the Bismarck police officers with whom she had been talking.\nThe story was then inflated by the media, leading to the urban legend that she\nhad come to America to search for the money in the film. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2003/jun/06/artsfeatures1 The\nGuardian article by Paul Berczeller] Instead, it was discovered, Konishi\nhad been very depressed after losing her job at a Tokyo travel agency, and had\ncome to Minnesota because it was a place she had previously visited with her\nlover, an American businessman. Depressed and lonely, Konishi had been wandering\nDetroit Lakes when she decided to commit suicide with an overdose of alcohol and\nsedatives. This theory was bolstered by the discovery of a forty minute phone\ncall she had made to her lover the previous night, and a suicide note she had\nsent to her parents expressing her intent to kill herself and that she had\ndisposed of most of her belongings before she left Bismarck.\n\nHer story was detailed in the 2003 documentary film This Is a True Story,\ndirected by Paul Berczeller, in which she was portrayed by Mimi Ohmori.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)","recorded":1364147324,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Tokyo","/wiki/Detroit_Lakes,_Minnesota","/wiki/Minneapolis","/wiki/Bismarck,_North_Dakota","/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota","/wiki/Suicide","/wiki/Steve_Buscemi","/wiki/Fargo_(film)","/w/index.php?title=Paul_Berczeller&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Urban_legend","#cite_note-test-1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Suicide_note","#cite_note-test-1","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-test_1-0","#cite_ref-test_1-1","http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2003/jun/06/artsfeatures1","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.4docs.org.uk/films/view/18/This+is+a+True+Story","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374278/","http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/fargo.asp","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&oldid=526987468","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:2001_deaths","/wiki/Category:Drug-related_suicides_in_Minnesota","/wiki/Category:Japanese_expatriates_in_the_United_States","/wiki/Category:Urban_legends","/wiki/Category:All_articles_with_unsourced_statements","/wiki/Category:Articles_with_unsourced_statements_from_March_2012","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/wiki/Category:Year_of_birth_uncertain","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Takako+Konishi+%28office+worker%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Takako+Konishi+%28office+worker%29","/wiki/Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)","/wiki/Talk:Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)","#","/wiki/Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&oldid=526987468","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Takako_Konishi_%28office_worker%29&id=526987468","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Takako+Konishi+%28office+worker%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Takako+Konishi+%28office+worker%29&oldid=526987468&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takako_Konishi_(office_worker)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=script
