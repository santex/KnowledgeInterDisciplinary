It has the highest carbon content, the\nfewest impurities, and the highest calorific content of all types of coals,\nwhich also include bituminous coal and lignite.\n\nAnthracite is the most metamorphosed type of coal (but still represents low-\ngrade metamorphism), in which the carbon content is between 92.1% and\n98%. The term is applied to those varieties of coal which\ndo not give off tarry or other hydrocarbon vapours when heated below their point\nof ignition. Anthracite ignites with difficulty and burns with a short, blue,\nand smokeless flame.\n\nAnthracite is categorized into standard grade, which is used mainly in power\ngeneration, and high grade (HG) and ultra high grade (UHG), the principal uses\nof which are in the metallurgy sector. Anthracite accounts for about 1% of\nglobal coal reserves, [http://www.worldcoal.org/bin/pdf/original_pdf_file/c-\noal_resource_overview_of_coal_report(03_06_2009).pdf World Coal Association -\nThe Coal Resource] and is mined in only a few countries around the world.\nChina accounts for the lionâs share of production; other producers are Russia,\nUkraine, North Korea, Vietnam, the UK, Australia and the US. Total production in\n2010 was 670 million tons.
