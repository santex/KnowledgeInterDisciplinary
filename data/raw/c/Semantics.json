The plural is used in analogy with words similar to physics, which was in\nthe neuter plural in Ancient Greek and meant \"things relating to nature\".\nis the study of meaning. It focuses on the relation between signifiers, like\nwords, phrases, signs, and symbols, and what they stand for, their denotata.\n\nLinguistic semantics is the study of meaning that is used for understanding\nhuman expression through language. Other forms of semantics include the\nsemantics of programming languages, formal logics, and semiotics.\n\nThe word semantics itself denotes a range of ideas, from the popular to the\nhighly technical. It is often used in ordinary language for denoting a problem\nof understanding that comes down to word selection or connotation. This problem\nof understanding has been the subject of many formal enquiries, over a long\nperiod of time, most notably in the field of formal semantics. In linguistics,\nit is the study of interpretation of signs or symbols used in agents or\ncommunities within particular circumstances and contexts. Within this view, sounds, facial expressions, body language, and proxemics\nhave semantic (meaningful) content, and each comprises several branches of\nstudy. In written language, things like paragraph structure and punctuation bear\nsemantic content; other forms of language bear other semantic content. {{cite book |last1=Neurath |first1=Otto |authorlink1=Otto\nNeurath |last2=Carnap |first2=Rudolf |authorlink2=Rudolf Carnap |last3=Morris\n|first3=Charles F.

(Editors) |title=International Encyclopedia of Unified\nScience |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL\n|year=1955}}\n\nThe formal study of semantics intersects with many other fields of inquiry,\nincluding lexicology, syntax, pragmatics, etymology and others, although\nsemantics is a well-defined field in its own right, often with synthetic\nproperties.

A.; Lexical Semantics, Cambridge,\nMA, 1986. In philosophy of language, semantics and reference are closely\nconnected. Further related fields include philology, communication, and\nsemiotics. The formal study of semantics is therefore complex.\n\nSemantics contrasts with syntax, the study of the combinatorics of units of a\nlanguage (without reference to their meaning), and pragmatics, the study of the\nrelationships between the symbols of a language, their meaning, and the users of\nthe language. {{cite book |title=Scientific Explanation\n|publisher=University of Minnesota Press
