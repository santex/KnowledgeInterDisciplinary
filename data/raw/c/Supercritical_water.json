{"cursor":"27737","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'supercritical fluid' is any substance at a temperature and pressure above its\ncritical point, where distinct liquid and gas phases do not exist. It can effuse\nthrough solids like a gas, and dissolve materials like a liquid. In addition,\nclose to the critical point, small changes in pressure or temperature result in\nlarge changes in density, allowing many properties of a supercritical fluid to\nbe \"fine-tuned\". Supercritical fluids are suitable as a substitute for organic\nsolvents in a range of industrial and laboratory processes. Carbon dioxide and\nwater are the most commonly used supercritical fluids, being used for\ndecaffeination and power generation, respectively.\n","linknr":463,"url":"Supercritical_water","recorded":1362372092,"links":43,"instances":["unit","matter","thermodynamics","unit","chemistry","molecule","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/SW-846/pdfs/3560.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/SW-846/pdfs/3561.pdf","http://www.norden.org/pub/ebook/2003-516.pdf","http://www.thomasarchibald.com/adobe/smbtheory.pdf","http://www.thomasarchibald.com/adobe/smbtheory.pdf","http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file18320.pdf","http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file18320.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/jessiek/MacData/afs.course.lockers/22/22.33/www/dostal.pdf","http://web.mit.edu/jessiek/MacData/afs.course.lockers/22/22.33/www/dostal.pdf"],"categories":["Condensed matter physics","Phases of matter"],"headings":["Properties","Phase diagram","Natural occurrence","Applications","History","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg/290px-Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/Carbon_dioxide_density-pressure_phase_diagram.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg/220px-Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Phase_change_-_en.svg/300px-Phase_change_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["critical_point","chemistry"],["pascal","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"],["water","molecule"],["bar","unit"],["atmosphere","unit"],["intercalation","chemistry"],["phase","matter"],["critical_point","thermodynamics"]],"members":["bar","phase","critical_point","atmosphere","intercalation","water","pascal"],"related":["Temperature","Pressure","Critical_point_(chemistry)","Effusion","Solids","Gas","Solvation","Liquid","Density","Organic_compound","Solvents","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Decaffeination","Kelvin","Pascal_(unit)","Atmosphere_(unit)","Carbon_dioxide","Water_(molecule)","IAPWS","Methane","Ethane","Propane","Ethylene","Propylene","Methanol","Ethanol","Acetone","Surface_tension","Arithmetic_mean","Equations_of_state","Group_contribution","Phase_diagram","Boiling_point","Gas","Bar_(unit)","Chemical_equilibrium","Viscosity","Relative_permittivity","Atmosphere_(unit)","Venus","Gas_giant","Jupiter","Saturn","Neptune","Uranus","Extrasolar_planet","55_Cancri_e","Gliese_876_d","Supercritical_fluid_extraction","Decaffeination","Hops","Essential_oils","Laboratory","Test_method","Supercritical_fluid_extraction","Solvent","Perchloroethylene","Dry-cleaning","Intercalation_(chemistry)","Supercritical_fluid_chromatography","High_performance_liquid_chromatography","Gas_chromatography","Flame_ionization_detector","Chiral","Simulated_moving_bed","Chiral","Isomer","Dye","Saturation_point","Nucleation","Spinodal_decomposition","Crystal_growth","Supercritical_drying","Aerogel","Electron_microscopy","Supercritical_water_oxidation","Hydrogen_Peroxide","Supercritical_hydrolysis","Lignin","Acid_hydrolysis","Enzymatic_hydrolysis","Supercritical_water_gasification","Thermal_efficiency","Heat_engine","Carnot_cycle","Fossil_fuel_power_plant","Operating_temperature","Malhotra,_Ashok","Supercritical_water_reactor","Supercritical_steam_generator","Biodiesel_production","Transesterification","Triglyceride","Glycerol","Methanol","Causticity","Enhanced_oil_recovery","Clean_coal_technology","Carbon_capture_and_storage","Flue_gases","Sleipner_gas_field","Biomass","Refrigeration","EcoCute","Chemical_vapour_deposition","Charles_Cagniard_de_la_Tour","Cannon","Sound","Flint","Phase_(matter)","Transcritical_cycle","Critical_point_(thermodynamics)"]}
