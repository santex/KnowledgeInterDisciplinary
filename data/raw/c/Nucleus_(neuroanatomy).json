{"cursor":"1999","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn neuroanatomy, a 'nucleus' is a brain structure consisting of a relatively\ncompact cluster of neurons. It is one of the two most common forms of nerve cell\norganization, the other being layered structures such as the cerebral cortex or\ncerebellar cortex. In anatomical sections, a nucleus shows up as a region of\ngray matter, often bordered by white matter. The vertebrate brain contains\nhundreds of distinguishable nuclei, varying widely in shape and size. A nucleus\nmay itself have a complex internal structure, with multiple types of neurons\narranged in clumps (subnuclei) or layers.\n\nThe term \"nucleus\" is in some cases used rather loosely, to mean simply an\nidentifiably distinct group of neurons, even if they are spread over an extended\narea. The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, for example, is a thin layer of\ninhibitory neurons that surrounds the thalamus.\n\nSome of the major anatomical components of the brain are organized as clusters\nof interconnected nuclei. Notable among these are the thalamus and hypothalamus,\neach of which contains several dozen distinguishable substructures. The medulla\nand pons also contain numerous small nuclei with a wide variety of sensory,\nmotor, and regulatory functions.\n\nIn the peripheral nervous system, a cluster of neurons is referred to instead as\na ganglion.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Nucleus_(neuroanatomy)","recorded":1362685296,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Neuroanatomy"],"headings":["Examples","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Cat_brain.jpg/40px-Cat_brain.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Neuroanatomy","Brain","Neuron","Cerebral_cortex","Cerebellum","Gray_matter","White_matter","Vertebrate","Thalamic_reticular_nucleus","Thalamus","Hypothalamus","Medulla_oblongata","Pons","Peripheral_nervous_system","Ganglion","Brainstem","Red_nucleus","Vestibular_nucleus","Inferior_olive","Cerebellum","Dentate_nucleus","Emboliform_nucleus","Globose_nucleus","Fastigial_nucleus","Basal_ganglia","Striatum","Caudate","Putamen","Globus_pallidus","Substantia_nigra","Subthalamic_nucleus","Cranial_nerve","Brain","Nervous_system"]}
