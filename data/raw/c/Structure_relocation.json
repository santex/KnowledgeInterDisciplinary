{"cursor":"22599","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":".]] A 'structure relocation' is the process of moving a structure from one\nlocation to another. There are two main ways for a structure to be moved:\ndisassembling, and then reassembling, it at the required destination, or\ntransporting it whole. For the latter, the building may be pushed on temporary\nrails or dollies if the distance is short. Otherwise, wheels, such as flatbed\ntrucks, are used. These moves can be complicated and require the removal of\nprotruding parts of the building, such as the chimney, as well as obstacles\nalong the journey, such as overhead cables and trees.\n\nReasons for moving a building range from commercial reasons such as scenery, to\npreserving an important or historic building. Moves may also be made simply at\nthe whim of the owner, or to separate a building from the plot of land that it\nstands on.\n","linknr":375,"url":"Structure_relocation","recorded":1362580232,"links":25,"instances":["county","device","mit_rahina","district","north_miami_beach","detroit","engineer","detroit","virginia","lake_havasu_city"],"pdf":["http://www.manchestercivic.org.uk/forum/22/F22_11.pdf"],"categories":["Civil
