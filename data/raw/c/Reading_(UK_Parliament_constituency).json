It comprised the town of Reading in the county of Berkshire.\n\nFrom 1295, as a parliamentary borough, Reading elected two Members of Parliament\n(MPs). When the parliamentary borough was replaced by a borough constituency in\n1885, this representation was reduced to a single MP. The constituency was\nabolished in 1950, re-created in 1955, and finally abolished in 1974.\n","linknr":519,"url":"Reading_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","recorded":1362484820,"links":16,"instances":["mp","died_1610","uk","mp","mp","died_1574","mp_for_reading","mp","politician","died_1558","uk_parliament_constituency","politician","uk_parliament_constituency","died_1413","england","mp_for_reading","diplomat","died_1528","mp_for_reading","died_1619","died_1516","mp","mp","mp","mp","mp","mp","died_1551","uk_parliament_constituency","uk_parliament_constituency","businessman","english_army_officer","mp","mp_for_reading","mp","mp","writer","reading_mp","died_1576","politician","died_1605","mp","uk","uk","barrister","mp_for_reading"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Parliamentary
