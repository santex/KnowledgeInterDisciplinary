Nucleus OS is an embedded software solution and is in an\nestimated 2.11 billion devices worldwide. [http://www.microcontroller.com/news/Mentor_Nucleus_RTOS_Over_-\n2_Billion.asp Mentor Nucleus RTOS in over 2.11 Billion Devices ]\n\nDevelopment is typically done on a host computer running Windows or Linux.\nApplications are compiled to run on various target CPU architectures and tested\nusing the actual target boards or in simulation environment.\n\nThe Nucleus RTOS is designed for embedded systems applications including\nconsumer electronics, set-top boxes, cellular phones, and other portable and\nhandheld devices. For limited memory systems Nucleus RTOS can be scaled down to\na memory footprint as small as 13 KB for both code and data.\n","linknr":269,"url":"Nucleus_RTOS","recorded":1362685296,"links":21,"instances":["language","operating_system"],"pdf":["http://s75.siemens-club.org/files/TD_Repair_L2.5_S75_R1.0.pdf","http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140crt/140crt951.pdf"],"categories":["Real-time operating systems","Embedded operating systems"],"headings":["Components","Products using Nucleus OS","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ada","language"],["bada","operating_system"]],"members":["ada","bada"],"related":["Mentor_Graphics","Closed_source","Real-time_computing","ARM_architecture","Freescale","MIPS_architecture","PowerPC","Nios_II","MicroBlaze","SuperH","Infineon","Atmel_AT91SAM","Real-time_operating_system","Embedded_system","Ada_(language)","Proprietary_software","Real-time_operating_system","Embedded_system","Mentor_Graphics","Central_processing_unit","CPU","Set-top_box","Cellular_phone","C++","POSIX","USB_2.0","USB_On-The-Go","Bluetooth","A2DP","AVRCP","Media_Transfer_Protocol","PictBridge","Peripheral_Component_Interconnect","PCI-X","Controller_Area_Network","CANopen","Internet_protocol_suite","IPv6","IEEE_802.11","File_Allocation_Table","Honeywell","Handheld","Logitech","SK_Telecom","CDMA","Mediatek","NEC","Mobile_phone","Handset","TI-Nspire","Operating_system","Garmin_International","GPS","BSS_Audio","Soundweb_London","Creative_ZEN","Infineon","Siemens","Infineon","Apple_Inc.","IPhone","Utility_location","Tandberg","Bada_(operating_system)"]}
