{"cursor":"20696","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n skulls: Human, Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Macaque]]\n\n'Biological anthropology' (also known as\n'bioanthropology' [http://www.indiana.edu/~anthro/bio_anthro.html ]\nand 'physical anthropology') is a branch of anthropology that studies the\nphysical development of the human species. It plays an important part in\npaleoanthropology (the study of human origins), bioarchaeology (the study of\npast populations), and in forensic anthropology (the analysis and identification\nof human remains for legal purposes). It draws upon human anthropometrics (body\nmeasurements), human genetics (molecular anthropology), human osteology (the\nstudy of bones) and includes neuroanthropology, the study of human brain\nevolution, and of culture as neurological adaptation to environment.\n\nIn two centuries biological anthropology has been involved in a range of\ncontroversies. The quest for human origins was accompanied by the evolution\ndebate and various racial theories. The nature and nurture debate became a\npolitical battleground. There have been various attempts to correlate human\nphysique with psychological traits such as intelligence, criminality and\npersonality type, many of which proved themselves mistaken and are now obsolete.\n","linknr":710,"url":"Biological_anthropology","recorded":1362483076,"links":71,"instances":["anthropologist","anthropologist","human_classification","forensics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.stanford.edu/class/ihum62/pdf/brown_armelagos2001.pdf","http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/MappingISBN1-59454-212-0.pdf"],"categories":["Biological
