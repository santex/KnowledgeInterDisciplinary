From 1995 to 2004, the European Medicines\nAgency was known as 'European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal\nProducts'. Set up by EC Regulation No. 2309/93 as the European Agency for\nthe Evaluation of Medicinal Products, and renamed by EC Regulation No. 726/2004\nto the European Medicines Agency, it had the acronym EMEA until December 2009.\nThe European Medicines Agency does not call itself EMA either - it currently has\nno official acronym but may reconsider if EMA becomes commonly accepted (see\n[http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/74766509en.pdf communication on\nnew visual identity] and\n[http://www.ema.europa.eu/htms/general/direct/visual_identity.htm logo]).\n\nRoughly parallel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but without FDA-\nstyle centralization, the European Medicines Agency was set up in 1995 with\nfunding from the European Union and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as\nindirect subsidy from member states, in an attempt to harmonize (but not\nreplace) the work of existing national medicine regulatory bodies. The hope was\nthat this plan would not only reduce the â¬350 million annual cost drug companies\nincurred by having to win separate approvals from each member state but also\nthat it would eliminate the protectionist tendencies of states unwilling to\napprove new drugs that might compete with those already produced by domestic\ndrug companies. The EU is currently the source of about one-third of the new\ndrugs brought onto the world market each year.\n\nBased in London, the EMA was born after more than seven years of negotiations\namong EU governments and replaced the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal\nProducts and the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products, though both of\nthese were reborn as the core scientific advisory committees.\n","linknr":225,"url":"European_Medicines_Agency","recorded":1362511110,"links":36,"instances":["european_union"],"pdf":["http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/74766509en.pdf","http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2011/09/WC500112071.pdf","http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2011/09/WC500112071.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/NewsEvents/UCM167310.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/NewsEvents/UCM167310.pdf"],"categories":["1993 in the European Union","Clinical research","Pharmaceutical industry","Agencies of the European Union","Government agencies established in 1993","National agencies for drug regulation","Organisations based in London","Regulators of biotechnology products","Health and the European Union","Clinical pharmacologists"],"headings":["Operations","Centralized marketing authorizations and CHMP/CVMP","Other Committees","Other activities","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/EMEA_logo.svg/100px-EMEA_logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ethics_committee","european_union"]],"members":["ethics_committee"],"related":["London","United_Kingdom","European_Union","Medication","United_States_of_America","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Centralization","European_Union","Medication","Protectionism","Sovereign_state","London","European_Union","Decentralization","European_Economic_Area","European_Free_Trade_Association","Committee_for_Medicinal_Products_for_Human_Use","European_Commission","Paediatric-use_marketing_authorisation","Paediatric","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Committee_on_Orphan_Medicinal_Products","Orphan_drug","European_Commission","Committee_on_Herbal_Medicinal_Products","European_Pharmaceutical_Regulation","European_Pharmaceutical_Regulation","Gene_therapy","Somatic_cell","Tissue_engineering","Ethics_Committee_(European_Union)","EudraCT","EudraGMP","EudraLex","EUDRANET","EudraPharm","EudraVigilance","European_and_Developing_Countries_Clinical_Trials_Partnership","European_Clinical_Research_Infrastructures_Network","European_Federation_of_Pharmaceutical_Industries_and_Associations","European_Forum_for_Good_Clinical_Practice","International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use","Inverse_benefit_law","Medicines_and_Healthcare_products_Regulatory_Agency","Qualified_Person","Regulation_of_therapeutic_goods","Supplementary_protection_certificate","Health_Products_and_Food_Branch_of_Health_Canada"]}
