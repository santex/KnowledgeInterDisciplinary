Many recyclers collect different colors of\nglass separately since glass retains its color after recycling. The most\ncommon types used for consumer containers are colorless glass, green glass,\nand brown/amber glass.\n\nGlass makes up a large component of household and industrial waste due to its\nweight and density. The glass component in municipal waste is usually made up of\nbottles, broken glassware, light bulbs and other items. Adding to this waste is\nthe fact that many manual methods of creating glass objects have a defect rate\nof around forty percent. Glass recycling uses less energy than manufacturing\nglass from sand, lime and soda.\n\nEvery metric ton (1,000 kg) of waste glass recycled into new items saves of\ncarbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere during the creation of\nnew glass. {{cite web\n| url = http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/Glass.htm\n| title = Glass recycling information sheet accessdate = 2006-11-26 publisher =\n| wasteonline.org.uk\n}}  Glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted is called cullet.\n\n","linknr":341,"url":"Glass_recycling","recorded":1362481669,"links":30,"instances":["golf","color"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass engineering and science|Recycling","Glass chemistry","Recycling by material"],"headings":["Glass collection","Glass recycling by country","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Glass-recycling.jpg/220px-Glass-recycling.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/CLOSEUP_OF_BEER_BOTTLES_CRUSHED_INTO_FINE_GLASS._THIS_MIXTURE_IS_FED_INTO_THE_GLASS_FURNACE_AND_NEW_BOTTLES_ARE_MADE..._-_NARA_-_543695.jpg/220px-CLOSEUP_OF_BEER_BOTTLES_CRUSHED_INTO_FINE_GLASS._THIS_MIXTURE_IS_FED_INTO_THE_GLASS_FURNACE_AND_NEW_BOTTLES_ARE_MADE..._-_NARA_-_543695.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Altglasleerung.JPG/220px-Altglasleerung.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["amber","color"],["bunker","golf"]],"members":["bunker","amber"],"related":["Amber_(color)","Waste","Glass","Industrial_waste","Municipal_waste","Bottle","Glassware","Light_bulb","Metric_ton","Carbon_dioxide","Pyrex","Borosilicate_glass","Furnace","Recycling","Landfill","British_Standard","Shopping_centre","Civic_amenity_site","United_Kingdom","CBE","British_Glass","Barnsley","Paper","Metal","Plastic","Waste_collector","United_Kingdom","Wine","Cory_Environmental","Portugal","Ceramic","Flux_agent","Brick","Astroturf","Top_dressing","Root","Bunker_(golf)","Recycled_glass_countertops","Sand_filter","Abrasive","Construction_aggregate","Tumwater,_Washington","Public_Works","Materials_recovery_facilities","Mechanical_biological_treatment","Electro-optical_sorting","Curbside_recycling","Oregon_Bottle_Bill","Glass","Recycling","Waste_management","Baler","Glass_crusher"]}
