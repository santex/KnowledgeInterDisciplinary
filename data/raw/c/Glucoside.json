{"cursor":"8714","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a plant-derived glucoside used as a surfactant.]] A 'glucoside' is a glycoside\nthat is derived from glucose. Glucosides are common in plants, but rare in\nanimals. Glucose is produced when a glucoside is hydrolysed by purely chemical\nmeans, or decomposed by fermentation or enzymes.\n\nThe name was originally given to plant products of this nature, in which the\nother part of the molecule was, in the greater number of cases, an aromatic\naldehydic or phenolic compound (exceptions are sinigrin and jalapin or\nscammonin). It has now been extended to include synthetic ethers, such as those\nobtained by acting on alcoholic glucose solutions with hydrochloric acid, and\nalso the polysaccharoses, e.g. cane sugar, which appear to be ethers also.\nAlthough glucose is the most common sugar present in glucosides, many are known\nwhich yield rhamnose or iso-dulcite; these may be termed pentosides. Much\nattention has been given to the non-sugar parts (aglyca) of the molecules; the\nconstitutions of many have been determined, and the compounds synthesized; and\nin some cases the preparation of the synthetic glucoside effected.\n\nThe simplest glucosides are the alkyl ethers which have been obtained by\nreacting hydrochloric acid on alcoholic glucose solutions. A better method of\npreparation is to dissolve solid anhydrous glucose in methanol containing\nhydrochloric acid. A mixture of alpha- and beta-methylglucoside results.\n\nClassification of the glucosides is a matter of some intricacy. One method\nbased on the chemical constitution of the non-glucose part of the molecules\nhas been proposed that posits four groups: (I) alkyl derivatives, (2)\nbenzene derivatives, (3) styrolene derivatives, and (4) anthracene\nderivatives. A group may also be constructed to include the cyanogenic\nglucosides, i.e. those containing prussic acid. Alternate classifications\nfollow a botanical classification, which has several advantages; in\nparticular, plants of allied genera contain similar compounds. In this\narticle the chemical classification will be followed, and only the more\nimportant compounds will be discussed herein.\n","linknr":283,"url":"Glucoside","recorded":1362512155,"links":21,"instances":["botany","biochemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glucosides|*Glucoside","Carbohydrates"],"headings":["Ethylene derivatives","Benzene derivatives","Styrolene derivatives","Anthracene derivatives","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Decyl-glucoside-2D-skeletal.png/220px-Decyl-glucoside-2D-skeletal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fermentation","biochemistry"],["cambium","botany"]],"members":["cambium","fermentation"],"related":["Glycoside","Glucose","Hydrolysis","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Enzyme","Molecule","Natural_phenol","Sinigrin","Jalapin","Ether","Alcohol","Hydrochloric_acid","Cane_sugar","Rhamnose","Methanol","Hydrochloric_acid","Alkyl","Benzene","Anthracene","Prussic_acid","Genus","Mustard_seed","Sinigrin","Potassium","Salt","Inyronic_acid","Black_pepper","Horseradish","Baryta","Myrosin","Potassium_hydrogen_sulfate","Sinalbin","Sinapin","Choline","Sinapic_acid","Jalapin","Scammony","Jalapinolic_acid","Cellotropin","Tuberculosis","Populin","Benzoyl-beta-D-glucoside","Natural_phenol","Polyphenol","Flavonoid","Arbutin","Bearberry","Methyl_arbutin","Hydroquinone","Antiseptic","Diuretic","Salicin","Willow","Ptyalin","Emulsin","Helicin","Ethylene","Styrolene","Coniferin","Cambium_(botany)","Conifer","Emulsin","Coniferyl_alcohol","Oxidation","Glycovanillin","Vanillin","Syringin","Methoxyconiferin","Fruit","Ester","Paraoxyhydratropic_acid","Pentosides","Naringin","Rhamnose","Hesperetin","Phloroglucin","Aesculin","Horse-chestnut","California_buckeye","Isomer","Fraxetin","Flavone","Quercitrin","Dyestuff","Rhamnose","Rhamnetin","Fisetin","Chrysin","Saponarin","Strophanthin","Ouabain","Emodin","Trioxymethylanthraquinone","Cyanogenetic","Amygdalin","Maltase","Glucose","Mandelic_nitrile_glucoside","Emulsin","Benzaldehyde","Prussic_acid","Amygdalin","Saponin","Indican","Indigo","Indigo","Indimulsiri","Indoxyl"]}
