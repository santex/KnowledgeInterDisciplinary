{"cursor":"25981","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'contraction' is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a\nword, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters.  In traditional grammar, contraction can denote the formation\nof a new word from one word or a group of words, for example, by elision. This\noften occurs in rendering a common sequence of words or, as in French, in\nmaintaining a flowing sound.\n\nIn strict analysis, contractions should not be confused with abbreviations or\nacronyms (including initialisms), with which they share some semantic and\nphonetic functions, though all three are connoted by the term \"abbreviation\" in\nloose parlance. Contraction is also distinguished from\nclipping, where beginnings and endings are omitted.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Contraction_(grammar)","recorded":1362897208,"links":26,"instances":["french","digraph","letter","social","letter","morphology","letter","grammar","french","phonetics","letter"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Abbreviations","Types of words","Syntactic categories"],"headings":["English","Chinese","French","Italian","Spanish","Portuguese","German","Norwegian","Latin","Japanese","Uyghur","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clipping","morphology"],["syncope","phonetics"],["elision","french"],["article","grammar"],["liaison","french"],["norm","social"],["f","letter"],["k","letter"],["s","letter"],["c","letter"],["ph","digraph"],["clipping","morphology"],["syncope","phonetics"]],"members":["elision","ph","s","norm","c","clipping","k","article","liaison","syncope","f"],"related":["Traditional_grammar","Word","Elision","French_language","Abbreviations","Acronym_and_initialism","Semantic","Phonetic","Clipping_(morphology)","English_language","Apostrophe","English_auxiliaries_and_contractions","Auxiliary_verb","Syncope_(phonetics)","Subject–auxiliary_inversion","Classical_Chinese","William_H._Baxter","Warring_States_Period","French_language","Elision_(French)","Spanish_language","Portuguese_language","German_language","Prepositional_phrase","Article_(grammar)","Dialectology","Standard_German","Bavarian_language","Franz_Beckenbauer","West_Central_German","Rhine_River","French_language","Liaison_(French)","Orthography","Norwegian_language","Bokmål","Å","Æ","Retroflex_flap","R-dropping","Norwegian_alphabet","Phoneme","Laziness","Ignorance","Norm_(social)","Loan_word","F_(letter)","K_(letter)","S_(letter)","C_(letter)","Q","X","Ph_(digraph)","English_language","Portuguese_language","Spanish_language","French_language","German_language","Swedish_language","Danish_language","Japanese_dialects","Uyghur_language","Turkic_languages","Central_Asia","Compound_verb","Serial_verb_construction","Lenition","Apostrophe","Blend","Clipping_(morphology)","Contractions_of_negated_auxiliary_verbs_in_English","Elision","Poetic_contraction","Portmanteau_word","Relaxed_pronunciation","Synalepha","Syncope_(phonetics)"]}
