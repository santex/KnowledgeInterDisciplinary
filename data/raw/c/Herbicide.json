{"cursor":"35501","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Herbicides', also commonly known as 'weedkillers', are pesticides used to kill\nunwanted plants. Selective herbicides kill specific\ntargets, while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed. Some of these act\nby interfering with the growth of the weed and are often synthetic \"imitations\"\nof plant hormones. Herbicides used to clear waste ground, industrial sites,\nrailways and railway embankments are not selective and kill all plant material\nwith which they come into contact. Smaller quantities are used in forestry,\npasture systems, and management of areas set aside as wildlife habitat.\n\nSome plants produce natural herbicides, such as the genus [[Juglans]] (walnuts),\nor the tree of heaven; such action of natural herbicides, and other related\nchemical interactions, is called allelopathy.\n\nHerbicides are widely used in agriculture and landscape turf management. In the\nUS, they account for about 70% of all agricultural pesticide use.\n","linknr":781,"url":"Herbicide","recorded":1362512372,"links":67,"instances":["herbicide"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Herbicides|","Soil contamination","Lawn care","Toxicology","Biocides"],"headings":["History","Health and environmental effects","Resistance","Classification","Organic herbicides","Application","Terminology","In current use","Historical interest: 2,4,5-T","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Sprayed_weeds.jpg/250px-Sprayed_weeds.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Hazardous-pesticide.jpg/140px-Hazardous-pesticide.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/RegaderaMetalica.jpg/100px-RegaderaMetalica.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Corn_01.JPG/16px-Corn_01.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Leaf_1_web.jpg/16px-Leaf_1_web.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["roundup","herbicide"]],"members":["roundup"],"related":["Pesticide","Plant","Crop","Weed","Hormones","Plant","Habitat","Walnut","Tree_of_heaven","Allelopathy","Agriculture","Cultural_controls","2,4-D","ICI","Rothamsted_Experimental_Station","Geneva_Protocol","Rothamsted_Experimental_Station","Judah_Hirsch_Quastel","Wheat","Maize","Rice","Cereal","Dicots","Monocots","Trimethylamine","Ester","Atrazine","PH","Glyphosate","Roundup_(herbicide)","Toxicity","Acute_toxicity","Carcinogenicity","Parkinson's_disease","Surface_runoff","Phenoxy_herbicides","Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds","2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin","Triazine","Breast_cancer","Causal","Monsanto_Company","New_York","Attorney_general","Dennis_Vacco","Death","Tordon_101","Dow_AgroSciences","Dow_Chemical_Company","Picloram","Paraquat","Inactive_ingredients","Adjuvants","Bird","Populations","Field_study","Silviculture","Clearcutting","United_Kingdom","Neotropical","2,4-D","Phenoxy_herbicides","Soft_tissue_sarcoma","Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma","Sex_reversal","Temperature-dependent_sex_determination","Selection_pressure","Atrazine","Glyphosate","Conyza_canadensis","Photodissociation","Mechanism_of_action","Meristems","Dicot","Acetolactate_synthase","Valine","Leucine","Isoleucine","Amino_acid","Sulfonylurea","Tryptophan","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Glyphosate","Auxin","Chlorophyll","Oxidation","Oxidation","Diquat","Paraquat","Nitrofen","Nitrofluorfen","Acifluorfen","Organic_farming","Spice","Vinegar","Steam","Flame","Limonene","Citrus","Monocerin","Johnson_grass","Sprayer","Chemigation","Agricultural_Research_Service","Weed-wiping","Herbicide_volatilisation","2,4-D","Auxin","Aminopyralid","Atrazine","Clopyralid","Dicamba","DL-Phosphinothricin","Fluroxypyr","Glyphosate","Imazapyr","Imazapic","Valine","Leucine","Isoleucine","BASF","Linuron","Metolachlor","Atrazine","Paraquat","Pendimethalin","Picloram","Sodium_chlorate","Triclopyr","2,4,5-T","2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","Pentachlorophenol","Polychlorinated_biphenyl","Dicamba","Triclopyr","Agent_Orange","Vietnam_War","Agent_Purple","Agent_Pink","Index_of_pesticide_articles","Bioherbicide","List_of_environmental_health_hazards","Rainbow_herbicides","Soil_contamination","Surface_runoff","Weed","Australian_Railway_History"]}
