It may make that process\naudible to the listener, or the process may be concealed. Primarily begun in the\n1960s, diverse composers have employed divergent methods and styles of process.\n\"A 'musical process' as Christensen defines it is a highly complex dynamic\nphenomenon involving audible structures that evolve in the course of the musical\nperformance ... 2nd order audible developments, i.e., audible developments\nwithin audible developments\" (Seibt 2004, xiii). These processes may involve\nspecific systems of choosing and arranging notes through pitch and time, often\ninvolving a long term change with a limited amount of musical material, or\ntransformations of musical events that are already relatively complex in\nthemselves. Steve Reich defines process music not as, \"the process of\ncomposition but rather pieces of music that are, literally, processes. The\ndistinctive thing about musical processes is that they determine all the note-to-\nnote (sound-to-sound) details and the overall form simultaneously. (Think of a\nround or infinite canon.)\" (Reich 2002, 34).\n","linknr":330,"url":"Process_music","recorded":1362477443,"links":22,"instances":["goeyvaerts","music","music","composer","music","composer","music","stockhausen","carter","carter","sense","carter","philosophy","professor_of_music","carter","music","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lists of musical works","Musical techniques"],"headings":["History","Theory","Notable works","See also","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Reichrhythm.gif/220px-Reichrhythm.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/8thNote.svg/20px-8thNote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Sharp.svg/40px-Sharp.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["process","philosophy"],["hearing","sense"],["pitch","music"],["round","music"],["canon","music"],["phrase","music"],["david_lang","composer"],["indeterminacy","music"],["repetition","music"],["sonata_for_two_pianos","goeyvaerts"],["sonata_for_cello_and_piano","carter"],["string_quartet_no._1","carter"],["string_quartet_no._2","carter"],["piano_concerto","carter"],["sonata_for_two_pianos","goeyvaerts"],["kontakte","stockhausen"],["tom_johnson","composer"],["john_tyrrell","professor_of_music"]],"members":["sonata_for_two_pianos","canon","round","tom_johnson","pitch","david_lang","phrase","kontakte","piano_concerto","hearing","sonata_for_cello_and_piano","process","john_tyrrell","indeterminacy","repetition"],"related":["Eighth_note","Music","Process_(philosophy)","Sound","Hearing_(sense)","Musical_development","Note","Pitch_(music)","Rhythm","Steve_Reich","Music_composition","Musical_form","Round_(music)","Canon_(music)","Minimal_music","Elliott_Carter","Alfred_North_Whitehead","Michael_Nyman","Serialism","Kyle_Gann","Karel_Goeyvaerts","Karlheinz_Stockhausen","Intuitive_music","György_Ligeti","Metronomes","Tempo","Phasing","Phrase_(music)","Phasing","Feedback","James_Tenney","Tone_row","Fifth","David_Lang_(composer)","Ambient_music","Brian_Eno","Johann_Pachelbel","Indeterminacy_(music)","Repetition_(music)","Electronic_music","Sonata_for_Two_Pianos_(Goeyvaerts)","Per_Nørgård","Generative_music","William_Basinski","Elliott_Carter","Sonata_for_Cello_and_Piano_(Carter)","String_Quartet_No._1_(Carter)","String_Quartet_No._2_(Carter)","Piano_Concerto_(Carter)","Brian_Eno","Morton_Feldman","Karel_Goeyvaerts","Sonata_for_Two_Pianos_(Goeyvaerts)","György_Ligeti","Annea_Lockwood","Alvin_Lucier","Terry_Riley","Frederic_Rzewski","Karlheinz_Stockhausen","Kontakte_(Stockhausen)","James_Tenney","LaMonte_Young","Tom_Johnson_(composer)","Conlon_Nancarrow","Johannes_Fritsch","Kyle_Gann","Stanley_Sadie","John_Tyrrell_(professor_of_music)","Michael_Nyman","Karlheinz_Stockhausen"]}
