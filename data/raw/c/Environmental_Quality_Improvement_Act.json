One of the two major purposes of the\nAct was to authorize the creation of an Office of Environmental Quality to\nprovide the professional and administrative staff needed for the Council on\nEnvironmental Quality. The second major purpose was to \"assure that\neach Federal department and agency conducting or supporting public works\nactivities which affect the environment shall implement the policies under\nexisting law\". To accomplish these purposes, the act gave more\nresponsibilities to the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality in his\nnew role as Director of the Office of Environmental Quality.\n","linknr":161,"url":"Environmental_Quality_Improvement_Act","recorded":1362551676,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2002-10-04/pdf/02-25161.pdf"],"categories":["United States federal environmental legislation","1970 in law","Law articles needing an infobox","1970 in the environment"],"headings":["Legislative History","Major Provisions of the Act","Impact of the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg/140px-Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_%28obverse%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["United_States_environmental_law","National_Environmental_Policy_Act","Council_on_Environmental_Quality","U.S._House_of_Representatives","U.S._Senate","Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States","Council_on_Environmental_Quality","President_of_the_United_States","Nancy_Sutley"]}
