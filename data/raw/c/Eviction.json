{"cursor":"9800","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n of New York City.]]\n\n'Eviction' is the removal of a tenant from rental property by the landlord. In\nsome jurisdictions it may also involve the removal of persons from premises that\nwere foreclosed by a mortgagee (often, the prior owners who defaulted on a\nmortgage).\n\nDepending on the laws of the jurisdiction, eviction may also be known as\n'unlawful detainer', 'summary possession', 'summary dispossess', 'forcible\ndetainer', 'ejectment', and 'repossession', among other terms. Nevertheless, the\nterm eviction is the most commonly used in communications between the landlord\nand tenant.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction involved, before a tenant can be evicted, a\nlandlord must win an eviction lawsuit or prevail in another step in the legal\nprocess. It should be borne in mind that eviction, as with [[ejectment]] and\ncertain other related terms, has precise meanings only in certain historical\ncontexts (e.g., under the English common law of past centuries), or with respect\nto specific jurisdictions. In present-day practice and procedure, there has come\nto be a wide variation in the content of these terms from jurisdiction to\njurisdiction. One should not assume that all aspects of the discussions below\nwill necessarily apply even in all states or other common law jurisdictions.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Eviction","recorded":1362570429,"links":25,"instances":["law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Landlordâ€“tenant law","Real estate","Real property law","Personal financial problems"],"headings":["The eviction process","Countries","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/East_Side_Eviction.jpg/250px-East_Side_Eviction.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Eviction_process_bc_canada.JPG/220px-Eviction_process_bc_canada.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tenement","law"]],"members":["tenement"],"related":["New_York_City","Tenement_(law)","Leasehold_estate","Landlord","Foreclosure","Jurisdiction","Landlord","Lawsuit","Common_law","Jurisdictions","Summons","Complaint","Answer","Trial","Default_judgment","Affirmative_defense","Stay_of_execution","Police_officer","Abandonment","Section_8_Notice","Retaliatory_eviction","Unlawful_eviction_and_harassment","Ejectment","Foreclosure","Lease","Quiet_title","The_Registry","Population_transfer","Dollars_&_Sense"]}
