{"cursor":"13909","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'unit of selection' is a biological entity within the hierarchy of biological\norganisation (e.g. self-reproducing molecules, genes, cells, individuals,\ngroups, species) that is subject to natural selection. For several decades\nthere has been intense debate among evolutionary biologists about the extent to\nwhich evolution has been shaped by selective pressures acting at these\ndifferent levels.\n\nThis debate has been as much about what it means to be a unit of selection as it\nhas about the relative importance of the units themselves, e.g., is it group or\nindividual selection that has driven the evolution of altruism? When it is noted\nthat altruism reduces the fitness of individuals, gene- or individual-centered\nexplanations for the evolution of altruism become more complex and rely on the\nuse of game theory, for instance; see Kin selection and group selection.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Unit_of_selection","recorded":1362483347,"links":19,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://paleo.ku.edu/geo/faculty/BSL/gouldselection.pdf","http://paleo.ku.edu/geo/faculty/BSL/gouldselection.pdf","http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/resources/publications_resources/DSW02.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Population genetics"],"headings":["Fundamental theory","Examples of selection at each level","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"]],"members":["cell"],"related":["Biological","RNA_world_hypothesis","Genes","Cell_(biology)","Individuals","Deme","Species","Natural_selection","Altruism","Kin_selection","Group_selection","Richard_Lewontin","Annual_Review_of_Ecology,_Evolution,_and_Systematics","John_Maynard-Smith","Eörs_Szathmáry","Elisabeth_Lloyd","George_C._Williams","Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","Richard_Dawkins","God's_utility_function","Utility_function","Meiotic_drive","Retrotransposon","Segregation_distortion","Retrotransposon","Leo_Buss","Evolutionary_developmental_biology","Metazoan","Cancer","Gastrulation","Darwinism","Richard_Dawkins","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Macroevolution","Microevolution","Modern_evolutionary_synthesis","Memetics","Leo_Buss","George_C._Williams","Richard_Dawkins","Richard_Dawkins","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Elisabeth_Lloyd","Elliott_Sober","Richard_Dawkins","Val_Dusek","Ernst_Mayr"]}
