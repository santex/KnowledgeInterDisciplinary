Aligned sequences of nucleotide or amino acid\nresidues are typically represented as rows within a matrix. Gaps are inserted\nbetween the residues so that identical or similar characters are aligned in\nsuccessive columns.\n\n, of two human zinc finger proteins, identified on the left by GenBank accession\nnumber.
