It consists of a number of rods, from which\nweighted objects or further rods hang. The objects hanging from the rods balance\neach other, so that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each rod hangs from\nonly one string, which gives it freedom to rotate about the string. Mobiles are\npopular in the nursery, where they hang over cribs to give infants something to\nentertain them and give them external visual stimulation. Mobiles have inspired\nmany composers, including Morton Feldman and Earle Brown who were inspired by\nAlexander Calder's mobiles to create mobile-like indeterminate pieces. Frank\nZappa also claimed that his compositions were modelled on Calder mobiles.\n\nThe meaning of the term \"mobile\" as applied to sculpture has evolved since it\nwas first suggested by Marcel Duchamp in 1931 to describe the early, mechanized\ncreations of Alexander Calder. Tomkins, Calvin: Duchamp: A Biography, pages\n294. Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1996. ISBN 0-8050-5789-7 At this point,\n\"mobile\" was synonymous with the term \"kinetic art\", describing sculptural works\nin which motion is a defining property. While motor or crank-driven moving\nsculptures may have initially prompted it, the word \"mobile\" later came to refer\nmore specifically to Calderâs free-moving creations. Influenced by the abstract\nwork of Piet Mondrian, Joan MirÃ³ and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Calder in many respects\ninvented an art form where objects (typically brightly coloured, abstract shapes\nfashioned from sheet metal) are connected by wire much like a balance scale. By\nthe sequential attachment of additional objects, the final creation consists of\nmany balanced parts joined by lengths of wire whose individual elements are\ncapable of moving independently or as a whole when prompted by air movement or\ndirect contact. Thus, \"mobile\" has become a more well-defined term referring to\nthe many such hanging constructs Calder produced in a prolific manner between\nthe 1930s until his death in 1976. A succinct definition of the term \"mobile\" in\na visual art sense could be a type of kinetic sculpture in which an ensemble of\nbalanced parts capable of motion are hung freely in space but which never come\ninto contact with each other.\n","linknr":137,"url":"Mobile_(sculpture)","recorded":1362688922,"links":34,"instances":["draught"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of sculpture","1931 introductions","Motion"],"headings":["Similar works","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Mobile.jpg/220px-Mobile.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["whippletree","draught"]],"members":["whippletree"],"related":["Kinetic_sculpture","Infant","Entertain","Stimulation","Composer","Morton_Feldman","Earle_Brown","Alexander_Calder","Indeterminate_music","Frank_Zappa","Marcel_Duchamp","Alexander_Calder","Piet_Mondrian","Joan_Miró","Sophie_Taeuber-Arp","Man_Ray","Bruno_Munari","Whippletree_(draught)","Wind_chime"]}
