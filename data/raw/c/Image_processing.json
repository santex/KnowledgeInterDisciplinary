{"cursor":"7479","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn imaging science, 'image processing' is any form of signal processing for\nwhich the input is an image, such as a photograph or video frame; the output of\nimage processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics or\nparameters related to the image. Most image-processing techniques involve\ntreating the image as a two-dimensional signal and applying standard signal-\nprocessing techniques to it.\n\nImage processing usually refers to digital image processing, but optical and\nanalog image processing also are possible. This article is about general\ntechniques that apply to all of them. The acquisition of images (producing the\ninput image in the first place) is referred to as imaging.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Image_processing","recorded":1362505068,"links":41,"instances":["electrical_engineering"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Image processing| *"],"headings":["Image Processing","See also","Further reading","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Imagen_binaria.jpg/300px-Imagen_binaria.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["signal","electrical_engineering"]],"members":["signal"],"related":["Imaging_science","Signal_processing","Photograph","Video_frame","Output","Parameter","Two-dimensional","Signal_(electrical_engineering)","Digital_image_processing","Optical_engineering","Analog_image_processing","Imaging_science","Computer_graphics","Computer_vision","Microarray","Photo_manipulation","Near_sets","Multidimensional_systems","Springer_Science+Business_Media"]}
