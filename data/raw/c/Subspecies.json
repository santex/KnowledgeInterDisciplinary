{"cursor":"7922","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn biological classification, 'subspecies' (abbreviated \"'subsp.'\" or \"'ssp.'\";\n[[plural]]: \"subspecies\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or\na taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized in isolation: a\nspecies will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or two or more\n(including any that are extinct), never just one.\n\nOrganisms that belong to different subspecies of the same species are capable of\ninterbreeding and producing fertile offspring, but they often do not interbreed\nin nature due to geographic isolation or other factors. The differences between\nsubspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species, but\nmore distinct than the differences between breeds or races (races can be\nassigned to different subspecies if taxonomically different). The\ncharacteristics attributed to subspecies generally have evolved as a result of\ngeographical distribution or isolation.\n","linknr":270,"url":"Subspecies","recorded":1362373620,"links":62,"instances":["plant","botany","botany","botany","biology","biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scientific classification|rank25","Botanical nomenclature|Subspecies","Plant taxonomy|1rank25","Zoological nomenclature|rank25","Biology terminology"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Criteria","Monotypic and polytypic species","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["race","biology"],["cline","biology"],["variety","botany"],["totora","plant"],["infraspecific_name","botany"],["autonym","botany"],["morphology","biology"],["race","biology"],["race","biology"],["cline","biology"],["variety","botany"],["strain","biology"]],"members":["totora","variety","autonym","infraspecific_name","strain","race","cline","morphology"],"related":["Biological_classification","Taxonomic_rank","Species","Taxon","Interbreeding","Geographic_isolation","Breed","Race_(biology)","Taxonomy","Zoology","Natural_History_Museum","Infrasubspecific","Cline_(biology)","Pet","Breed","Binomial_nomenclature","Trinomen","Tiger","Sumatran_tiger","Microbiology","National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information","Botany","Variety_(botany)","Subvariety","Totora_(plant)","Italic_type","Infraspecific_name_(botany)","Zoological_nomenclature","White_Wagtail","Botanical_nomenclature","Autonym_(botany)","American_Herring_Gull","European_Herring_Gull","Morphology_(biology)","Species","Eurasian_Rock_Pipit","Water_Pipit","White_Wagtail","Cryptic_species_complex","Race_(biology)","Populations","Mayr,_Ernst","Race_(biology)","Cline_(biology)","Gene_flow","Color_phase","Variety_(botany)","Cultivar","Strain_(biology)","Landrace","Ernst_W._Mayr","Peter_D._Ashlock"]}
