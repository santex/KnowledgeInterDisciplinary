{"cursor":"2518","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Conformation-activity relationship' is the relationship between the biological\nactivity and the conformation or conformational changes of a biomolecule. This\nterminology emphasizes the importance of dynamic conformational changes for the\nbiological function, rather than the importance of static three-dimensional\nstructure used in the analysis of structure activity relationships.\n\nThe conformational changes usually take place during intermolecular association,\nsuch as proteinâprotein interaction or protein-ligand binding. A binding partner\nchanges the conformation of a biomolecule (e.g. a protein) to enable or disable\nits biochemical activity.\n\nMethods for analysis of conformation activity relationship vary from [[in\nsilico]] or using experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography\nand NMR where the conformation before and after activity can be compared\nstatically or using dynamic methods such as dual polarisation interferometry or\ncircular dichroism where the kinetics as well as degree of conformational change\ncan be quantified.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Conformation_activity_relationship","recorded":1362890001,"links":10,"instances":["molecular"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medicinal chemistry"],"headings":["Experimental techniques","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["binding","molecular"]],"members":["binding"],"related":["Biological_activity","Chemical_structure","Conformational_change","Structure_activity_relationship","Binding_(molecular)","Protein–protein_interaction","Protein_ligand","X-ray_crystallography","NMR","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Circular_dichroism","Chemical_kinetics","X-ray_crystallography","NMR","Dual_polarisation_interferometry","Circular_Dichroism"]}
