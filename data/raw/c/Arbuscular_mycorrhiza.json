{"cursor":"41321","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"An 'arbuscular mycorrhiza' (plural 'mycorrhizae' or 'mycorrhizas', aka AM Fungi)\nis a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus penetrates the cortical cells of the\nroots of a vascular plant.\n\nArbuscular mycorrhizae (AMs) are characterized by the formation of unique\nstructures such as arbuscules and vesicles by fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota\n(AM fungi). AM fungi (AMF) help plants to capture nutrients such as phosphorus,\nsulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients from the soil. It is believed that the\ndevelopment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the\ninitial colonisation of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular\nplants.\n\nIt has been said that it is quicker to list the plants that do not form\nmycorrhizae than those that do. Harley, J.L., Smith , S.E.,\n1983. Mycorrhizal Symbiosis. Academic Press: London. This symbiosis is a\nhighly evolved mutualistic relationship found between fungi and plants, the most\nprevalent plant symbiosis known,  and AM is found in 80%\nof vascular plant families in existence today.\n\nThe tremendous advances in research on mycorrhizal physiology and ecology over\nthe past 40 years have led to a greater understanding of the multiple roles of\nAMF in the ecosystem. This knowledge is applicable to human endeavors of\necosystem management, ecosystem restoration, and agriculture.\n","linknr":489,"url":"Arbuscular_mycorrhiza","recorded":1362509321,"links":19,"instances":["biology","botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Symbiosis","Mycology","Soil biology"],"headings":["Evolution of mycorrhizal symbiosis","Physiology","Ecology","Phytoremediation","Agriculture","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Arbuscular_mycorrhiza_microscope.jpg/450px-Arbuscular_mycorrhiza_microscope.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cortex","botany"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle","cortex"],"related":["Mycorrhiza","Fungus","Cortex_(botany)","Vascular_plant","Vesicle_(biology)","Glomeromycota","Nutrient","Phosphorus","Sulfur","Nitrogen","Symbiosis","Vascular_plant","Physiology","Ecology","Ecosystem","Ecosystem_restoration","Agriculture","Paleobiological","Rhynie_chert","Devonian","Early_Devonian","Bryophyte","Protostele","Rhizome","Mycelium","Parenchyma","Miocene","Glomerales","Symbiont","Parasite","Saprobe","Glomales","Marchantiophyta","Exudate","Hypha","Strigolactone","G._K._Podila","Chemotaxis","Parenchyma","Protoplast","Paris_type","Hyphae","Arum_type","Chromatin","DNA","Vacuole","Organelle","Cytoskeleton","Hexose","Mycelium","Trehalose","Glycogen","Pentose_phosphate_pathway","Pentose","Lipid","Gluconeogenesis","Mycorrhizal_network","Photosynthesis","Nitrogen_nutrition_in_the_arbuscular_mycorrhizal_system","PH","Ammonium","Nitrogen","Tropical_rainforest","Pathogen","Mycotroph","Rhizosphere","Nod_factor","Diazotroph","Rhizobia","Root_nodule","Desertification","Tillage","Fungicide","Agroecosystem","Flax","Tillage","Glomalin","Monoclonal","Antibody","Soil_erosion"]}
