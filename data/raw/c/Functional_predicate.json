{"cursor":"7935","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn formal logic and related branches of mathematics, a 'functional predicate',\nor 'function symbol', is a logical symbol that may be applied to an object term\nto produce another object term. Functional predicates are also sometimes called\nmappings, but that term has other meanings as well. In a model, a function\nsymbol will be modelled by a function.\n\nSpecifically, the symbol F in a formal language is a functional symbol if, given\nany symbol X representing an object in the language, F(X) is again a symbol\nrepresenting an object in that language. In typed logic, F is a functional\nsymbol with domain type 'T' and codomain type 'U' if, given any symbol X\nrepresenting an object of type 'T', F(X) is a symbol representing an object of\ntype 'U'. One can similarly define function symbols of more than one variable,\nanalogous to functions of more than one variable; a function symbol in zero\nvariables is simply a constant symbol.\n\nNow consider a model of the formal language, with the types 'T' and 'U' modelled\nby sets ['T'] and ['U'] and each symbol X of type 'T' modelled by an element [X]\nin ['T']. Then F can be modelled by the set\n: [F]:=\\big\\{([X],[F(X)]):[X]\\in[\\mathbf{T}]\\big\\},\nwhich is simply a function with domain ['T'] and codomain ['U']. It is a\nrequirement of a consistent model that [F(X)] = [F(Y)] whenever [X] = [Y].\n","linknr":120,"url":"Functional_predicate","recorded":1362898138,"links":14,"instances":["logic","mathematics","logic","logic","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Model theory"],"headings":["Introducing new function symbols","Doing without functional predicates","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/c/93cfe40d62a0a32b9eab5e2cdf949ca2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/d/54df5697e565a4235e0689ccf3a9303b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/5/8/e5824c3fe5480262cd5a6a7f37ecd1d9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/d/9/6d9a10981d1dc7aa49a8030797df897f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/7/5e7462cc9d579fe41e39d733442f99f1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/6/f/f6f2cbe72cb739188be53112a5bd016d.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["model","logic"],["function","mathematics"],["0","number"],["set","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["predicate","logic"],["predicate","logic"],["schema","logic"]],"members":["predicate","function","model","schema","set"],"related":["Formal_logic","Mathematics","Model_(logic)","Function_(mathematics)","Formal_language","Given_any","Typed_logic","0_(number)","Logical_constant","Set_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","For_all","Subtype","Theorem","Formal_system","There_exists","Unique","Predicate_(logic)","If_and_only_if","Predicate_(logic)","Metalogic","Gödel's_incompleteness_theorem","Codomain","For_all","Unique","Schema_(logic)","Universally_quantify","Material_conditional","Axiom_schema_of_replacement","Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory","Mathematical_symbols","Logical_connective","Logical_constant"]}
