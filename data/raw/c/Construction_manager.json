A construction manager holds the same responsibilities and\ncompletes the same processes in each sector. All that separates a construction\nmanager in one sector from one in another is the knowledge of the construction\nsite. This may include different types of equipment, materials, subcontractors,\nand possibly locations. A contractor is assigned to a construction project once\nthe design has been completed by the architect or is still in progress. This is\ndone by going through a bidding process with different contractors. The\ncontractor is selected by using one of the three selection methods: low-bid\nselection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based selection. A\nconstruction manager should have the ability to handle public safety, time\nmanagement, decision making, mathematics, and human resources.\n","linknr":665,"url":"Construction_manager","recorded":1362897961,"links":35,"instances":["cmaa"],"pdf":["http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf","http://www.acce-hq.org/PDF/form103.pdf","http://www.cectexas.org/research_&_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf","http://www.cectexas.org/research_&_policy_issues/documents/2007DesignBuildandAlternateProjectDeliveryIssuesinTexas.pdf"],"categories":["Construction","Building engineering","Construction and extraction occupations"],"headings":["Functions","The Five Types of Construction","Construction management jobs","Obtaining the Project","Project stages","Issues Resulting from Construction","Construction Activity Documentation","Resolving Disputes","Terminology","Study and practice","Required knowledge","Skills and abilities","Business model","Regulation","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Acap.svg/36px-Acap.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/BBI_2010-07-23_5.JPG/300px-BBI_2010-07-23_5.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Acap.svg/36px-Acap.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Panam%C3%A1_Construction.JPG/220px-Panam%C3%A1_Construction.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["construction_management_association_of_america","cmaa"]],"members":["construction_management_association_of_america"],"related":["Bidding","Construction_Communication","Construction_Management_Association_of_America_(CMAA)","Superintendent","Endangered","Diary","Mediation","Arbitration","Associate_degree","Baccalaureate_degree","Masters_degree","Project_management","Operations_management","Engineer_degree","Doctor_of_philosophy","Postdoctoral_researcher","Customer_Service","Human_Resources","Time_Management","Panama_City","Panama","Architect","Engineer","General_contractor","Virtual_Design_and_Construction","Scope_creep","Construction_collaboration_technology","Guaranteed_Maximum_Price"]}
