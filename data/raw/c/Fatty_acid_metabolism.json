Excess fatty acids, glucose,\nand other nutrients can be stored efficiently as body fat. Triglycerides\nyield more than twice as much energy for the same mass as do carbohydrates or\nproteins. All cell membranes are built up of phospholipids, each of which\ncontains two fatty acids. Fatty acids are also used for protein modification.\nThe metabolism of fatty acids, therefore, consists of catabolic processes\nthat generate energy and primary metabolites from fatty acids, and anabolic\nprocesses that create biologically important molecules from fatty acids and\nother dietary carbon sources.\n","linknr":511,"url":"Fatty_acid_metabolism","recorded":1362477335,"links":23,"instances":["mass","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metabolism","Fatty acids","Hepatology"],"headings":["Overview","Fatty acids as an energy source","Digestion and transport","Transport and oxidation","Synthesis","Regulation and control","Disorders","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Metabolism_790px_partly_labeled.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Gtk-dialog-info.svg/15px-Gtk-dialog-info.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Metabolism_790px.png/50px-Metabolism_790px.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pound","mass"],["cell","biology"]],"members":["pound","cell"],"related":["Energy","Adenosine_triphosphate","Glucose","Adipose_tissue_","Triglyceride","Carbohydrate","Protein","Cell_membrane","Phospholipids","Catabolism","Primary_metabolite","Anabolic","Carbon","Lipolysis","Lipases","Glycerol","Beta_oxidation","Acetyl_CoA","Citric_acid_cycle","Acyl-CoA_dehydrogenase","FAD","Enoyl-CoA_hydratase","3-hydroxyacyl-CoA_dehydrogenase","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Acetyl-CoA","Acyl-CoA","Acetyl-CoA","Acetyl-CoA","Propionyl-CoA","Redox","Anhydrous","Gram","Calorie","Hydrocarbon","Hydrophobic","Molecule","Anhydrous","Glycogen","Water","Pound_(mass)","Fat","Hibernation","Triglyceride","Intestine","Pancreatic_lipase","Colipase","Bile_salt","Chylomicron","Lacteals","Lymph_system","Blood","Hepatocyte","Adipocyte","Muscle_fiber","Liver","Lipoprotein","Very-low-density_lipoprotein","Low-density_lipoprotein","Very-low-density_lipoprotein","LDL_receptor","High-density_lipoprotein","Glucagon","Hormone-sensitive_lipase","Serum_albumin","Serum_albumin","Muscle","Liver","Adipocytes","Lipid_droplet","Sterol","Perilipin","Lipase","Hormone-sensitive_lipase","Epinepherine","Glucagon","Hormone-sensitive_lipase","Triglyceride","Glycerol","Fatty_acid","Metabolism","Serum_albumin","Cytosol","Fatty_acids","Mitochondria","Β-oxidation","Electron_transport_chain","Outer_mitochondrial_membrane","Carnitine-palmitoyl_transferase_I","Inner_mitochondrial_membrane","Carnitine","Mitochondrial_matrix","Palmitoylcarnitine","Coenzyme_A","Acetyl-CoA","Rate-limiting_step","Β-oxidation","Acetyl-CoA","Citric_acid_cycle","NADH","FADH2","Electron_transport_chain","Adenosine_triphosphate","Alpha_oxidation","Omega_oxidation","Peroxisome","Lipolysis","Insulin","Glucagon","Norepinephrine","Epinephrine","G_protein-coupled_receptor","Adenylate_cyclase","Cyclic_AMP","Protein_phosphatase","Phosphodiesterase","Lipogenesis","Hypertriglyceridemia","Triglyceride","Hyperlipidemia","Inborn_errors_of_lipid_metabolism","Fatty_oxidation_disorder","Inborn_errors_of_metabolism","Oxidize","Fatty_acid","Cell_(biology)","Fatty_acid_synthase","Essential_fatty_acid"]}
