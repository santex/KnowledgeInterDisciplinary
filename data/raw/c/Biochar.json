{"cursor":"35857","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"; right - an oxisol transformed into fertile terra preta using biochar.]]\n\n'Biochar' is a name for charcoal when it is used for particular purposes,\nespecially as a soil amendment. Like all charcoal, biochar is created by\npyrolysis of biomass. Biochar is under investigation as an approach to carbon\nsequestration to produce negative carbon dioxide emissions. {{cite news |publisher = The Independent |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/ancient-skills-\ncould-reverse-global-warming-1055700.html |title=Ancient skills 'could reverse\nglobal warming' |first=Geoffrey |last=Lean |date=Sunday, 7 December 2008\n|accessdate=1 October 2011}} Biochar thus has the potential to help\nmitigate climate change, via carbon sequestration. {{Cite\nweb |title=Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty |url=http://royalsociety.org/Geoengineering-the-\nclimate/ |publisher=The Royal Society |year=2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010\n}} Independently, biochar can increase soil fertility, increase\nagricultural productivity and provide protection against some foliar and soil-\nborne diseases. Furthermore, biochar reduces pressure on forests, though the\ndegree to which results offer long term carbon sequestration in practice has\nbeen challenged. Biochar is a stable solid, rich in carbon and can\nendure in soil for thousands of years.\n","linknr":457,"url":"Biochar","recorded":1362500111,"links":33,"instances":["soil","journal"],"pdf":["http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Biochar-Cameroon-report1.pdf","http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Biochar-Cameroon-report1.pdf","http://www.biochar-international.org/images/NZSR64_1_Winsley.pdf","http://www.biochar-international.org/images/NZSR64_1_Winsley.pdf","https://www.agronomy.org/files/students/2010-ricigliano-entry.pdf","http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/publ/FrontiersEcolEnv%205,%20381-387,%202007%20Lehmann.pdf","http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/publ/FrontiersEcolEnv%205,%20381-387,%202007%20Lehmann.pdf","http://www.garnautreview.org.au/CA25734E0016A131/WebObj/d07119990GeneralSubmission-DepartmentofAgricultureandFoodWA-Lehmann__2006_char_review/$File/d07%20119990%20General%20Submission%20-%20Department%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20WA%20%20-%20Lehmann__2006_char_review.pdf","http://www.garnautreview.org.au/CA25734E0016A131/WebObj/d07119990GeneralSubmission-DepartmentofAgricultureandFoodWA-Lehmann__2006_char_review/$File/d07%20119990%20General%20Submission%20-%20Department%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20WA%20%20-%20Lehmann__2006_char_review.pdf"],"categories":["Environmental soil science","Soil improvers","Wildfire ecology"],"headings":["History","Production","Uses","Research","Emerging commercial sector","See also","Notes","References","External links","News"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Terra_Preta.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fertility","soil"],["nature","journal"]],"members":["fertility","nature"],"related":["Terra_preta","Charcoal","Pyrolysis","Biomass","Carbon_sequestration","Negative_carbon_dioxide_emission","The_Independent","Climate_change","The_Royal_Society","Fertility_(soil)","Forests","Carbon","Pre-Columbian_era","Amazon_Rainforest","Smolder","French_Guiana","Earthworm","Pyrolysis","Oxygen","Combustion","Char","Gasification","Syngas","Bio-oil","Black_carbon","Greenhouse_gas","Toxin","Kiln","Brazil","Sugarcane","Bagasse","Dielectric_heating","The_Guardian","Old-growth_forest","Coal","James_Hansen","Goddard_Institute_for_Space_Studies","James_Lovelock","Gaia_hypothesis","Mitigation_of_global_warming","Greenhouse_gas_remediation","Nature_Communications","Thermal_decomposition","Potash","PH","Soil_conditioner","Greenhouse_gases","Nutrient_leaching","Soil_acidity","Irrigation","Fertilizer","Organic_matter","Nitrous_oxide","Methane","Pesticide","Chlordane","Amazon_basin","Tilth","Tropical_rainforest","Cellulosic_ethanol","Space_heater","Furnace","Boiler","Cofiring","Gas_turbine","Reciprocating_engine","Biodiesel","Ultra-low_sulfur_diesel","Fischerâ€“Tropsch_process","Methanol","Hydrogen","Cornell_University","University_of_Edinburgh","Stevens_Institute_of_Technology","Supercapacitor","Stevens_Institute_of_Technology","University_of_Florida","Phosphate","Methane_gas","University_of_Florida","Emissions_trading","European_Climate_Exchange","Fossil_fuel","Geoengineering","Congo_Basin_Forest_Fund","Central_Africa","Deforestation","Food_security","Renewable_energy","North_America","Australia","England","Boulder,_Colorado","Dunlap,_Tennessee","Ponzi_scheme","Vertical_farming","Soil_carbon","Soil_ecology","Pellet_fuel","Nature_(journal)","New_Scientist"]}
