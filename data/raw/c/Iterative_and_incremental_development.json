For\nexample, the 1985 DOD-STD-2167 mentions (in section 4.1.2): \"During software\ndevelopment, more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in\nprogress at the same time.\" and \"This process may be described as an\n\"evolutionary acquisition\" or \"incremental build\" approach.\" The relationship\nbetween iterations and increments is determined by the overall software\ndevelopment methodology and software development process. The exact number and\nnature of the particular incremental builds and what is iterated will be\nspecific to each individual development effort.\n\n\nIterative and incremental development are essential parts of the Modified\nwaterfall models, Rational Unified Process, Extreme Programming and generally\nthe various agile software development frameworks.\n\nIt follows a similar process to the plan-do-check-act cycle of business process\nimprovement.\n","linknr":386,"url":"Iterative_and_incremental_development","recorded":1362479203,"links":38,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":["http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/downloads/misc/history-of-iterative-larman-and-basili-ieee-computer.pdf","http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/downloads/misc/history-of-iterative-larman-and-basili-ieee-computer.pdf","http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2008/200805/200805-Cockburn.pdf","http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2008/200805/200805-Cockburn.pdf","http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/downloads/misc/history-of-iterative-larman-and-basili-ieee-computer.pdf","http://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/downloads/misc/history-of-iterative-larman-and-basili-ieee-computer.pdf"],"categories":["Management","Project management","Software development philosophies","Software project management"],"headings":["The basic idea","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Iterative_development_model_V2.jpg/300px-Iterative_development_model_V2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg/220px-Coding_Shots_Annual_Plan_high_res-5.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Agile_Project_Management_by_Planbox.png/220px-Agile_Project_Management_by_Planbox.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Development-iterative.gif/320px-Development-iterative.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["patch","computing"]],"members":["patch"],"related":["Iterative_design","Iterative_method","Incremental_build_model","John_von_Neumann","DOD-STD-2167","Software_development_methodology","Software_development_process","Modified_waterfall_models","Rational_Unified_Process","Extreme_Programming","Agile_software_development","PDCA","Business_process_improvement","Software_developer","Iteration","Software_documentation","Software_Design_Document","Usability","Craig_Larman","Victor_Basili","MIL-STD-498","Patch_(computing)","Incremental_build_model","Rapid_application_development","Dynamic_Systems_Development_Method","Extreme_Programming","Continuous_integration","Kaizen","Rational_Unified_Process","Unified_Process","Microsoft_Solutions_Framework","Interaction_Design","OpenUP/Basic","Object-oriented_analysis_and_design","Goal-Driven_Software_Development_Process","Spiral_model","USAF","IEEE_Computer"]}
