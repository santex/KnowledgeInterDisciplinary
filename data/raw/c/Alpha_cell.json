They make up 33-46% of the\nhuman islet cells and are responsible for synthesizing and secreting the peptide\nhormone glucagon, which elevates the glucose levels in the blood.\n\nTo elevate glucose levels, glucagon binds to receptors on hepatocytes (liver\ncells) and some other cells (e.g. kidney cells). This activates an enzyme,\nglycogen phosphorylase, inside the hepatocyte to hydrolyse glycogen to glucose.\nThis process is called glycogenolysis. In rodents, alpha cells are located in\nthe periphery of the islets, however in humans the islet architecture is\ngenerally less organized and alpha cells are frequently observed inside the\nislets as well. When being viewed by an electron microscope, alpha cells can be\nidentified by their characteristic granules with a large dense core and a small\nwhite halo.\n\nAlternative and more common spellings: 'alpha-cell' or 'Î±-cell'.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Alpha_cell","recorded":1362668915,"links":21,"instances":["cell_biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Peptide hormone secreting cells"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["granule","cell_biology"]],"members":["granule","cell"],"related":["Endocrine_system","Cell_(biology)","Islets_of_Langerhans","Pancreas","Peptide","Hormone","Glucagon","Glucose","Blood","Hepatocyte","Glycogen_phosphorylase","Glycogen","Glycogenolysis","Electron_microscope","Granule_(cell_biology)","Glucagonoma"]}
