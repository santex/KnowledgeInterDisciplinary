To reduce\nthe overhead of managing on-disk data structures, the filesystem does not\nallocate individual disk sectors by default, but contiguous groups of\nsectors, called clusters.\n\nOn a disk that uses 512-byte sectors, a 512-byte cluster contains one sector,\nwhereas a 4-kibibyte (KiB) cluster contains eight sectors.\n\nA cluster is the smallest logical amount of disk space that can be allocated to\nhold a file. Storing small files on a filesystem with large clusters will\ntherefore waste disk space; such wasted disk space is called slack space. For\ncluster sizes which are small versus the average file size, the wasted space per\nfile will be statistically about half of the cluster size; for large cluster\nsizes, the wasted space will become greater. However, a larger cluster size\nreduces bookkeeping overhead and fragmentation, which may improve reading and\nwriting speed overall. Typical cluster sizes range from 1 sector (512 B) to 128\nsectors (64 KiB).\n\nA cluster need not be physically contiguous on the disk; it may span more than\none track or, if sector interleaving is used, may even be discontiguous within a\ntrack. This should not be confused with fragmentation, as the sectors are still\nlogically contiguous.\n\nThe term cluster was changed to allocation unit in DOS 4.0. However the term\ncluster is still widely used. Mueller, Scott (2002). Upgrading and repairing\nPCs, p. 1354.
