{"cursor":"1103","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'Guaranteed Maximum Price' (also known as GMP, Not-To-Exceed Price, NTE, or\nNTX) contract is a cost-type contract (also known as an open-book contract)\nwhere the contractor is compensated for actual costs incurred plus a fixed fee\n'subject to a ceiling price'. The contractor is responsible for cost overruns,\nunless the GMP has been increased via formal change order (only as a result of\nadditional scope from the client, not price overruns, errors, or omissions).\nSavings resulting from cost underruns are returned to the owner. This is\ndifferent from a fixed-price contract (also known as stipulated price contract\nor lump-sum contract) where cost savings are typically retained by the\ncontractor and essentially become additional profits.\n","linknr":85,"url":"Guaranteed_Maximum_Price","recorded":1362567529,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pricing"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/ThreeCoins.svg/40px-ThreeCoins.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fixed-price_contract","Labor_and_materials"]}
