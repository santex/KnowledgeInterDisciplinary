It may also have the function of transporting foreign particles. The\nproperty of reducing friction is known as lubricity. (Slipperiness)\n\nA good lubricant possesses the following characteristics:\n* High boiling point.\n* Low freezing point.\n* High viscosity index.\n* Thermal stability.\n* Corrosion prevention.\n* High resistance to oxidation.\n\nOne of the single largest applications for lubricants, in the form of motor oil,\nis protecting the internal combustion engines in motor vehicles and powered\nequipment.\n\nTypically lubricants contain 90% base oil (most often petroleum fractions,\ncalled mineral oils) and less than 10% additives. Vegetable oils or synthetic\nliquids such as hydrogenated polyolefins, esters, silicones, fluorocarbons and\nmany others are sometimes used as base oils. Additives deliver reduced friction\nand wear, increased viscosity, improved viscosity index, resistance to corrosion\nand oxidation, aging or contamination, etc.\n\nLubricants such as 2-cycle oil are added to fuels like gasoline which has low\nlubricity. Sulfur impurities in fuels also provide some lubrication properties,\nwhich has to be taken in account when switching to a low-sulfur diesel;\nbiodiesel is a popular diesel fuel additive providing additional lubricity.\n\nNon-liquid lubricants include grease, powders (dry graphite, PTFE, Molybdenum\ndisulfide, tungsten disulfide, etc.), PTFE tape used in plumbing, air cushion\nand others. Dry lubricants such as graphite, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten\ndisulfide also offer lubrication at temperatures (up to 350 Â°C) higher than\nliquid and oil-based lubricants are able to operate. Limited interest has been\nshown in low friction properties of compacted oxide glaze layers formed at\nseveral hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems, however, practical\nuse is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature.\n\nAnother approach to reducing friction and wear is to use bearings such as ball\nbearings, roller bearings or air bearings, which in turn require internal\nlubrication themselves, or to use sound, in the case of acoustic lubrication.\n\nIn addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other\npurposes. Other uses include cooking (oils and fats in use in frying pans, in\nbaking to prevent food sticking), bio-medical applications on humans (e.g.\nlubricants for artificial joints), ultrasound examination, internal examinations\nfor males and females, and the use of personal lubricant for sexual purposes.\n","linknr":356,"url":"Lubricants","recorded":1362375565,"links":43,"instances":["certification","mechanical","lubricant"],"pdf":["http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag/2004/38/i02/pdf/es034236p.pdf"],"categories":["Petroleum products","Lubricants|","Tribology"],"headings":["Purpose","Types of lubricants","Other relevant phenomena","Additives","Application by fluid types","Marketing","Disposal and environmental","Societies and industry bodies","Major publications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["grease","lubricant"],["bearing","mechanical"],["bearing","mechanical"],["blue_angel","certification"],["grease","lubricant"]],"members":["blue_angel","bearing","grease"],"related":["Friction","Lubricity","Viscosity_index","Oxidation","Motor_oil","Internal_combustion_engine","Petroleum","Mineral_oil","Oil_additive","Vegetable_oil","Polyolefin","Ester","Silicone","Fluorocarbon","Viscosity","Corrosion","Oxidation","2-cycle_oil","Fuel","Sulfur","Diesel_fuel","Biodiesel","Grease_(lubricant)","Graphite","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Molybdenum_disulfide","Tungsten_disulfide","Dry_lubricant","Compacted_oxide_glaze_layer","Bearing_(mechanical)","Ball_bearing","Roller_bearing","Air_bearing","Acoustic_lubrication","Oil","Fat","Frying_pan","Medical","Replacement_joint","Personal_lubricant","Moving_parts","Friction","Oil_additive","Heat_capacity","Turbocharger","Bearing_(mechanical)","Hydraulic_fluid","Working_fluid","Automatic_transmission","Torque_converter","Fluid_bearing","Oil","Crude_oil","American_Petroleum_Institute","Sulfur","Society_of_Automotive_Engineers","Viscosity_index","Polyalphaolefins","Ester","North_America","Synthetic_oil","Europe","Viscosity_Index","Canola_oil","Castor_oil","Palm_oil","Sunflower_seed_oil","Rapeseed_oil","Tall_oil","Lanolin","Whale_oil","Oil_additive","Automatic_transmission_fluid","National_Non-Food_Crops_Centre","Lanolin","Sheep","Water","Polyalpha-olefin","Esters","Polyalkylene","Glycols","Phosphate_ester","Alkylated_naphthalenes","Silicate_esters","Ionic_fluids","Polytetrafluoroethylene","Graphite","Boron_nitride","Molybdenum_disulfide","Tungsten_disulfide","Solid_lubricant","Cadmium","Gold","Lead","Tin","Zinc","Bronze","Polymer_brush","Compacted_oxide_layer_glaze","Antioxidant","Detergent","AW_additive","Metal_deactivator","Corrosion_inhibitors","Friction_modifier","EP_additive","Anti-foaming_agent","Viscosity_index_improver","Emulsion","Hypoid","Engine_oil","Gasoline","Diesel_engine","Automatic_transmission","Gearbox","Brake_fluid","Hydraulic_fluid","Universal_Tractor_Transmission_Oil_–_UTTO","Super_Tractor_Oil_Universal_–_STOU_–_includes_engine","Two-stroke_oil","Gas_compressor","Gear","Gas_turbine","Piston_engine","Crankcase","NSF_International","Society_of_Automotive_Engineers","European_Automobile_Manufacturers_Association","JASO","American_Petroleum_Institute","Viscosity_index","Blue_Angel_(certification)","Ecolabel","Recycling","Burning","Landfill","Crude_oil","Distilling","Lanolin","American_Petroleum_Institute","Society_of_Tribologists_and_Lubrication_Engineers","National_Lubricating_Grease_Institute","Society_of_Automotive_Engineers","Independent_Lubricant_Manufacturer_Association","European_Automobile_Manufacturers_Association","Japanese_Automotive_Standards_Organization","Petroleum_Packaging_Council","Castor_oil","Grease_(lubricant)","Lubrication","Mineral_oil","Motor_oil","Oil_analysis","Penetrating_oil","Personal_lubricant","Society_of_Tribologists_and_Lubrication_Engineers","Tribology"]}
