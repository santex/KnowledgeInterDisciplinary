{"cursor":"2798","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn European Union law, a 'decision' is a legal instrument which is binding upon\nthose individuals to which it is addressed. Per\nArticle 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly\nArticle 249 TEC). They are one of three kinds of legal instruments which\nmay be effected under EU law which can have legally binding effects on\nindividuals. Decisions may be addressed to member states or\nindividuals. The Council of the European Union can\ndelegate power to make decisions to the European Commission.\n\nThe legislative procedure for adoption of a decision varies depending on its\nsubject matter. The ordinary legislative procedure (formerly known as the\nCodecision procedure) requires agreement of and allows amendments by both the\nEuropean Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The Assent procedure\nrequires agreement of both Parliament and Council, but the Parliament can only\nagree or disagree to the text as a whole - it cannot propose amendments. The\nConsultation procedure requires agreement of the Council alone, the Parliament\nmerely being consulted on the text. In some areas, such as competition policy,\nthe Commission may itself issue decisions.\n\nCommon uses of decisions involve the Commission ruling on proposed mergers, and\nday-to-day agricultural matters (e.g. setting standard prices for vegetables).\n\nOn the basis of case law, decisions may have direct effect, that is to say they\nmay be invoked by individuals before national courts.\n","linknr":260,"url":"European_Union_decision","recorded":1362669306,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["European Union law"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/European_stars.svg/110px-European_stars.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Eurozone.svg/100px-Eurozone.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/EP_Groups_1979-2009.png/100px-EP_Groups_1979-2009.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/EP-constituencies.svg/100px-EP-constituencies.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg/30px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/29px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["European_Union_law","Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union","Treaty_establishing_the_European_Community","Council_of_the_European_Union","European_Commission","Ordinary_legislative_procedure","European_Parliament","Council_of_the_European_Union","Assent_procedure","Consultation_procedure","Direct_effect"]}
