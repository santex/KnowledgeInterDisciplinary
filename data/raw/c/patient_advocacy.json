{"cursor":"17811","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Patient advocacy' is an area of lay specialization in health care concerned\nwith patient education about the use of health plans and how to obtain needed\ncare. Patient advocates include government consumer advocacy agencies, which\nprovide services to the public at large, and private sector for-profit and non-\nprofit service providers, which offer services to individual patients. In the\nUnited States, most states have established within their government structures\nan office of patient advocacy or similar function.\n\nMore broadly, patient advocacy can include groups that develop policies and\nlegislation to improve systems or processes for patients, such as the\nAlzheimer's Association, the British Diabetic Association, and the American\nCancer Society. Such patient advocacy organizations are characteristically non-\nprofit and focus on one aspect of health care or a specific disease, generally\nalso conducting fundraising and awareness campaigns and producing healthcare\nliterature and information services. These organizations normally do not engage\nin the provision of clinical support or the conduct of liaison between patient\nand provider.\n\nThe 'patient advocate' may be an individual or an organization. The terms\n'patient advocate' and 'patient advocacy' can refer both to individual advocates\nproviding services that organizations also provide, and to organizations whose\nfunctions extend to individual patients. There are also governmental agencies\nthat study and ensure compliance with government regulations including financial\naid. Some patient advocates work for the institutions that are directly\nresponsible for the patientâs care.\n\nAn individual patient advocate typically acts as liaison between a patient and\ntheir health care provider. By professional background, individual patient\nadvocates have often been case managers in the field of social work whose\nspecialty is navigating the bureaucracy of large health plans or government-\nprovided services, or former doctors, nurses or other trained health care\nprofessionals who have re-focused on helping patients in their decision-making.\nPatient advocacy services can also include transition assistance to older\npatients moving into assisted living and nursing homes, or such mundane but\nessential tasks as transportation, bill tracking, and payment assistance. There\nis currently no accredited certification or licensing for patient advocacy in\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, or thus far in any other country. Many\ncolleges and universities offer educational opportunities for students wishing\nto provide patient advocacy\nservices. http://HealthAdvocatePrograms.com These range from weekend\nworkshops, to online webinars, to year-long certificate programs. Patient\nadvocates are individually responsible for self-education concerning the\ngeneral business of medicine, HMO rules, and local institutional changes to\ncompliance articulation and implementation, as well as following relevant\nlegislative changes.\n","linknr":238,"url":"patient_advocacy","recorded":1371244375,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit","/wiki/Talk:Patient_advocacy","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest","/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup","/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view","/wiki/Talk:Patient_advocacy","/wiki/Health_care","/wiki/Health_insurance","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_Association","/wiki/Diabetes_UK","/wiki/American_Cancer_Society","/wiki/Health_care_provider","/wiki/Social_work","/wiki/Health_insurance","/wiki/Physician","/wiki/Nursing","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/College","/wiki/University","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Web_conferencing","/wiki/Health_maintenance_organization","#Individual_patient_advocate","#Individual_patient_advocate_organizations","#Patient_advocacy_groups","#Education_in_patient_advocacy","#Patient_advocacy_awards","#Organizations_and_governmental_agencies","#Nursing_and_patient_advocacy","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Health_care","/wiki/Health_care_provider","/wiki/Release_of_information_department","/wiki/Power_of_attorney","/wiki/Healthcare","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_note-10","#cite_note-11","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-13","/wiki/Health_Advocate","#cite_note-14","#cite_note-15","/w/index.php?title=Health_Advocacy_Group_LLC&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_note-16","#cite_note-17","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Health_advocacy","#cite_note-18","#cite_note-19","#cite_note-20","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-21","#cite_note-22","#cite_note-23","#cite_note-24","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=5","http://schueleraward.com","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Ombudsman","/wiki/New_York","#cite_note-25","#cite_note-26","/wiki/Health_care","/wiki/California","/wiki/Hospitals","/wiki/Health_insurance","/wiki/Ombudsman","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Nurses","/wiki/Social_workers","/wiki/Nursing","/wiki/American_Nurses_Association","#cite_note-27","/wiki/Nursing_ethics","#cite_note-28","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=8","/wiki/File:Nursing_symbol.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Nursing_symbol.svg/32px-Nursing_symbol.svg.png","/wiki/Portal:Nursing","/wiki/Patient_empowerment","/wiki/Health_Advocacy","/wiki/Ombudsman","/wiki/Organizational_Ombudsman","/wiki/Geriatric_care_management","/w/index.php?title=Patient_advocacy&action=edit&section=9","http://www.healthcareadvocates.com","#cite_ref-1","http://HealthAdvocatePrograms.com","#cite_ref-2","http://www.advoconnection.com","#cite_ref-3","http://www.paoihealth.org","#cite_ref-4","http://www.houstonpatientadvocacy.com","#cite_ref-5","http://www.patientadvocates.com","#cite_ref-6","http://www.mynursefirst.com","#cite_ref-7","http://www.libertyadvocacygroup.com.com","#cite_ref-8","http://www.patientadvocate.org","#cite_ref-9","http://www.firstmeasurepatientadvocates.com","#cite_ref-10","http://www.kare360.com","#cite_ref-11","http://www.socalhealthadvocates","#cite_ref-12","http://www.thekarisgroup.com/Services/Patient_Advocacy/index.html","#cite_ref-13","http://www.guardiannurses.com","#cite_ref-14","http://www.healthadvocate.com","#cite_ref-15","http://www.health-care-navigators.com","#cite_ref-16","http://www.patientadv
