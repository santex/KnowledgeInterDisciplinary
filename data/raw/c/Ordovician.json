It follows the\nCambrian Period and is followed by the Silurian Period. The Ordovician, named\nafter the Celtic tribe of the Ordovices, was defined by Charles Lapworth in 1879\nto resolve a dispute between followers of Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison,\nwho were placing the same rock beds in northern Wales into the Cambrian and\nSilurian periods respectively. Lapworth, recognizing that the fossil fauna in\nthe disputed strata were different from those of either the Cambrian or the\nSilurian periods, realized that they should be placed in a period of their own.\nWhile recognition of the distinct Ordovician Period was slow in the United\nKingdom, other areas of the world accepted it quickly. It received international\nsanction in 1960, when it was adopted as an official period of the Paleozoic Era\nby the International Geological Congress.\n\nLife continued to flourish during the Ordovician as it did in the Cambrian,\nalthough the end of the period was marked by a significant mass extinction.\nInvertebrates, namely mollusks and arthropods, dominated the oceans. Fish, the\nworld's first true vertebrates, continued to evolve, and those with jaws may\nhave first appeared late in the period. Life had yet to diversify on land.\n","linknr":830,"url":"Ordovician","recorded":1362372854,"links":95,"instances":["continent","animals","age","geology","geology","geology"],"pdf":["http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/precambrian/Gradstein_Ogg_2004.pdf","http://www3.wooster.edu/geology/WilsonPalmer06.pdf","http://www3.wooster.edu/geology/WilsonPalmer06.pdf","http://www.stratigraphy.org/ics%20chart/ChronostratChart2012.pdf"],"categories":["Ordovician|"],"headings":["Dating","Subdivisions{{anchor|Subdivisions}}","Paleogeography","Geochemistry","Climate
