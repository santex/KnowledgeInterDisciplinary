{"cursor":"7517","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In astronomy, the 'velocity dispersion', Ï, is the statistical dispersion of\nvelocities about the mean velocity for a group of objects, such as an open\ncluster, globular cluster, galaxy, galaxy cluster, or supercluster. By measuring\nthe radial velocities of its members, the velocity dispersion of a cluster can\nbe estimated and used to derive the cluster's mass from the virial\ntheorem. Collins Dictionary of Astronomy, 2nd Ed.; Harper Collins\nPublishers; 2000; pp.444,449 Radial velocity is found by measuring the\nDoppler width of spectral lines of a collection of objects. The more radial\nvelocities one measures, the more accurately one knows their dispersion. A\n'central velocity dispersion' refers to the Ï of the interior regions of an\nextended object, such as a galaxy or cluster.\n\nThis relationship takes several forms in astronomy based on the object(s) being\nobserved. For instance, the M-Ï relation was found for material circling black\nholes, the Faber-Jackson relation for elliptical galaxies, and the Tully-Fisher\nrelation for spiral galaxies. For example, the Ï found for objects about the\nMilky Way's supermassive black hole (SMBH) is about 75 km/s. {{cite journal\n| last1 = Gebhardt first1 = Karl last2 = Bender first2 = Ralf last3 = Bower,\n| Gary; Dressler, Alan; Faber, S.
