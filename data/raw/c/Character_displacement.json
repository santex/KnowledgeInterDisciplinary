{"cursor":"13831","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Character displacement' refers to the phenomenon where differences among\nsimilar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in\nregions where the species co-occur but are minimized or lost where the speciesâ\ndistributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change\ndriven by competition among species for a limited resource (e.g. food). The\nrationale for character displacement stems from the competitive exclusion\nprinciple, also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable\nenvironment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological\nniche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other\nthrough competition.\n\nCharacter displacement was first explicitly explained by William L. Brown and E.\nO. Wilson (1956): âTwo closely related species have overlapping ranges. In the\nparts of the ranges where one species occurs alone, the populations of that\nspecies are similar to the other species and may even be very difficult to\ndistinguish from it. In the area of overlap, where the two species occur\ntogether, the populations are more divergent and easily distinguished, i.e.,\nthey âdisplaceâ one another in one or more characters. The characters involved\ncan be morphological, ecological, behavioral, or physiological; they are assumed\nto be genetically based.â\n\nBrown and Wilson (1956) used the term character displacement to refer to\ninstances of both 'reproductive character displacement', or reinforcement of\nreproductive barriers, and 'ecological character displacement' driven by\ncompetition. As the term character displacement is commonly used, it generally\nrefers to morphological differences due to competition. Brown and Wilson viewed\ncharacter displacement as phenomenon involved in speciation, stating, âwe\nbelieve that it is a common aspect of geographical speciation, arising most\noften as a product of the genetic and ecological interaction of two (or more)\nnewly evolved, cognate species [derived from the same immediate parental\nspecies] during their period of first contactâ (1956). While character\ndisplacement is important in various scenarios of speciation, Thierry LodÃ©\n\"La guerre des sexes chez les animaux\" 2006 Eds Odile jacob, Paris ISBN 2-7381-1901-\n8 including adaptive radiations like the cichlid fish faunas in the rift\nlakes of East Africa (Meyer 1993), it also plays an important role in\nstructuring communities. The results of numerous studies contribute evidence\nthat character displacement often influences the evolution of resource\nacquisition among members of an ecological guild (Dayan and Simberloff 2005).\n\n'Competitive release' (Grant 1972), defined as the expansion of an ecological\nniche in the absence of a competitor, is essentially the mirror image of\ncharacter displacement. It too was described by Brown and Wilson (1956): âTwo\nclosely related species are distinct where they occur together, but where one\nmember of the pair occurs alone it converges toward the second, even to the\nextent of being nearly identical with it in some characters.â\n","linknr":130,"url":"Character_displacement","recorded":1362483541,"links":12,"instances":["ecology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Evolutionary biology"],"headings":["Examples","Conceptual development","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["guild","ecology"]],"members":["guild"],"related":["Evolution","Competitive_exclusion_principle","Competition","E._O._Wilson","Speciation","Speciation","Thierry_Lodé","Adaptive_radiation","Guild_(ecology)","Galapagos","Three-spined_stickleback","Cape_Verde_Islands","Bismarck_Archipelago","Darwin's_finches","Caribbean","Lesser_Antilles","Canada","Sympatric_speciation","Salamander","Species","Nectar","Introduced_species","Mink","Belarus","Joseph_Grinnell","Ecological_niche","Ecological_communities","Competition","Sympatry","Allopatry","Community_ecology","Adaptation","Quantitative_genetics","Phylogenetic_systematics","Niche_segregation","Sexual_conflict"]}
