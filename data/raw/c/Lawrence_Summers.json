Eliot University Professor at Harvard University's\nKennedy School of Government. He is the 1993 recipient of the John Bates Clark\nMedal for his work in several fields of economics.\n\nSummers also served as the 27th President of Harvard University from 2001 to\n2006. Summers resigned as Harvard's president in the wake of a no-confidence\nvote by Harvard faculty that resulted in large part from Summers's conflict with\nCornel West, financial conflict of interest questions regarding his relationship\nwith Andrei Shleifer, and a 2005 speech in which he suggested that the under-\nrepresentation of women in science and engineering could be due to a \"different\navailability of aptitude at the high end,\" and less to patterns of\ndiscrimination and socialization.\n\nSummers has also been criticized for the economic policies he advocated as\nTreasury Secretary and in later writings.
