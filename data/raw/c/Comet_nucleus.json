A cometary nucleus is composed of rock, dust, and\nfrozen gases. When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an\natmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma. The force exerted on the\ncoma by the Sun's radiation pressure and solar wind cause an enormous tail to\nform, which points away from the Sun. A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of\n0.04. {{cite web |date=November 29, 2001 |title=Comet Borrelly\nPuzzle: Darkest Object in the Solar System |publisher=Space.com |author=Robert\nRoy Britt |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/borrelly_dark_-\n011129.html |accessdate=October 26, 2008}}\n","linknr":296,"url":"Comet_nucleus","recorded":1362685296,"links":31,"instances":["minor_planet","physics","geology","cometary"],"pdf":["http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/7011.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/7011.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/2214.pdf","http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2006/pdf/2214.pdf"],"categories":["Comets|*"],"headings":["Splitting","Size","Albedo","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/PIA02127.jpg/250px-PIA02127.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Hyakutake_Color.jpg/76px-Hyakutake_Color.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rock","geology"],["sublimation","physics"],["coma","cometary"],["centaur","minor_planet"],["coma","cometary"]],"members":["centaur","sublimation","rock","coma"],"related":["Comet","Rock_(geology)","Dust","Gas","Sun","Sublimation_(physics)","Atmosphere","Coma_(cometary)","Radiation_pressure","Solar_wind","3D/Biela","Comet_Shoemaker–Levy_9","73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann","Ephorus","42P/Neujmin","53P/Van_Biesbroeck","Saturn","Comet_Hale–Bopp","29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann","109P/Swift–Tuttle","28P/Neujmin","Halley's_comet","Deep_Space_1","19P/Borrelly","Hale–Bopp","P/2007_R5","Centaur_(minor_planet)","10199_Chariklo","2060_Chiron","1995_SN55","Gram","Gram","Kilogram","Rubble_pile","Halley's_Comet","Tempel_1","19P/Borrelly","81P/Wild","Giotto_mission","Halley's_Comet","Deep_Space_1","19P/Borrelly","Outgassing","Near-earth_asteroid","Extinct_comets","14827_Hypnos","3552_Don_Quixote","Coma_(cometary)"]}
