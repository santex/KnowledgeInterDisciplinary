Proskuryakov, S. Y. a., Konoplyannikov, A. G. & Gabai, V. L.\nNecrosis: a specific form of programmed cell death? Experimental Cell Research\n283, 1-16, doi:10.1016/s0014-4827(02)00027-7 (2003). Necrosis is caused by\nfactors external to the cell or tissue, such as infection, toxins, or trauma\nthat result in the unregulated digestion of cell components. In contrast,\napoptosis is a naturally occurring programmed and targeted cause of cellular\ndeath. While apoptosis often provides beneficial effects to the organism,\nnecrosis is almost always detrimental and can be fatal. Kasper\nD.L., Zaleznik D.F. (2001). Gas gangrene, antibiotic associated colitis, and\nother Clostridial infections. In Braunwald E., Kasper D.L. et.al (Eds).\nHarrisonsâs principles of internal McGraw Hill, New York\n\nCells that die due to necrosis do not follow the apoptotic signal transduction\npathway but rather various receptors are activated that result in the loss of\ncell membrane integrity and an uncontrolled release of products of cell death\ninto the intracellular space. This initiates an\ninflammatory response in the surrounding tissue: Nearby phagocytes are prevented\nfrom locating and engulfing the dead cells. The result is a\nbuild-up of dead tissue and cell debris at, or near, the site of the cell death.\nA classic example is gangrene. For this reason, it is often necessary to remove\nnecrotic tissue surgically, a process known as debridement.\n","linknr":460,"url":"Necrosis","recorded":1362543757,"links":61,"instances":["medical","medicine","biology","biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v16/n1/pdf/cdd2008150a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/cdd/journal/v16/n1/pdf/cdd2008150a.pdf"],"categories":["Death","Cellular processes","Necrosis"],"headings":["Classification","Causes","Pathogenesis","Treatment","In plants","See also","References","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Structural_changes_of_cells_undergoing_necrosis_or_apoptosis.png/360px-Structural_changes_of_cells_undergoing_necrosis_or_apoptosis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Ambox_warning_blue.svg/20px-Ambox_warning_blue.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Tissue_necrosis_following_bite_from_Bothrops_asper_PLoS_Medicine.jpg/160px-Tissue_necrosis_following_bite_from_Bothrops_asper_PLoS_Medicine.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["tissue","biology"],["denaturation","biochemistry"],["hypoxia","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"],["trauma","medicine"]],"members":["hypoxia","trauma","tissue","denaturation","cell"],"related":["Greek_language","Cell_injury","Death","Cell_(biology)","Tissue_(biology)","Apoptosis","Phagocytes","Phagocytosis","Gangrene","Debridement","Autolysis","Gene","Organelles","Coagulative_necrosis","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Albumin","Hypoxia_(medical)","Infarction","Ischemia","Liquefactive_necrosis","Leukocyte","Pus","Hypoxia_(medical)","Infarction","Caseous_necrosis","Mycobacteria","Tuberculosis","Friable","Amorphous","Granuloma","Fat_necrosis","Lipase","Pancreas","Pancreatitis","Pancreatic_enzymes","Peritoneum","Triglyceride","Fatty_acids","Saponification","Fibrinoid_necrosis","Antigen","Antibodies","Artery","Fibrin","Gangrene","Gummatous","Spirochaete","Spider_bite","Brown_recluse_spider","Loxosceles","Chilean_recluse","Yellow_sac_spider","Hobo_spider","Venom","Apoptosis","Tumor_suppressor","P53","Interferon-beta","Spalacid","Pit_viper","Ecuador","Antibiotic","Frostbite","Bacterial_toxin","Complement_system","Natural_killer_cells","Peritoneal","Macrophage","Intestinal_mucosa","Pathogen","Snake_venom","Pathological","Cytokines","Nitric_oxide","Reactive_oxygen_species","Oxygen","Glucose","Cell_biology","Physiological","T-lymphocytes","Caspase","Embryogenesis","Oncosis","Blebbing","Pyknosis","Karyorrhexis","Karyolysis","Chromatin","Microvilli","Ischemia","Myocardial_infarction","Hypoxia_(medical)","Reactive_oxygen_species","Antioxidant","Trauma_(medicine)","Antibiotics","Anti-inflammatory","Immunosuppressive","Anti-inflammatory_drugs","Snake_bite","Anti-venom","Antibiotics","Debridement","Amputation","Proteolytic","Fibrinolytic","Collagenase","Maggot_therapy","Pectin","Avascular_necrosis","Frostbite","Gangrene","Necrotizing_fasciitis","Osteonecrosis_of_the_jaw","Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis"]}
