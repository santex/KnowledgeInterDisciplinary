The microscope has a digital camera, and is\nattached to a computer.]] The 'optical microscope', often referred to as the\n\"'light microscope'\", is a type of microscope which uses visible light and a\nsystem of lenses to magnify images of small samples. Optical microscopes are the\noldest design of microscope and were possibly designed in their present compound\nform in the 17th century. Basic optical microscopes can be very simple, although\nthere are many complex designs which aim to improve resolution and sample\ncontrast. Historically optical microscopes were easy to develop and are popular\nbecause they use visible light so that samples may be directly observed by eye.\n\nThe image from an optical microscope can be captured by normal light-sensitive\ncameras to generate a micrograph. Originally images were captured by\nphotographic film but modern developments in CMOS and charge-coupled device\n(CCD) cameras allow the capture of digital images. Purely digital microscopes\nare now available which use a CCD camera to examine a sample, showing the\nresulting image directly on a computer screen without the need for eyepieces.\n\nAlternatives to optical microscopy which do not use visible light include\nscanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.\n","linknr":501,"url":"Optical_microscope","recorded":1362669547,"links":52,"instances":["wave_propagation","vision","optics","electromagnetic_radiation","optics","optics","microscope","biology"],"pdf":["http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/esplora/microscopio/dswmedia/risorse/testi_completi.pdf","http://www.fy.chalmers.se/microscopy/students/imagecourse/O1.pdf"],"categories":["Microscopy","Dutch
