These\nmetallopeptidases belong to the MEROPS peptidase family M12, subfamily M12A\n(astacin family, clan MA(M)). The protein fold of the peptidase domain for\nmembers of this family resembles that of thermolysin, the type example for clan\nMA and the predicted active site residues for members of this family and\nthermolysin occur in the motif HEXXH.\n\nThe astacin family of metalloendopeptidases (EC 3.4.24.21) encompasses a range\nof proteins found in hydra to humans, in mature and developmental systems. Their functions include activation of growth factors,\ndegradation of polypeptides, and processing of extracellular proteins. The proteins are synthesised with N-terminal signal\nand pro-enzyme sequences, and many contain multiple domains C-terminal to the\nprotease domain. They are either secreted from cells, or are associated with the\nplasma membrane.\n\nThe astacin molecule adopts a kidney shape, with a deep active-site cleft\nbetween its N- and C-terminal domains. The zinc\nion, which lies at the bottom of the cleft, exhibits a unique penta-coordinated\nmode of binding, involving 3 histidine residues, a tyrosine and a water molecule\n(which is also bound to the carboxylate side chain of Glu93). The N-terminal domain comprises 2 alpha-helices and a\n5-stranded beta-sheet. The overall topology of this domain is shared by the\narchetypal zinc-endopeptidase thermolysin. Astacin protease domains also share\ncommon features with serralysins, matrix metalloendopeptidases, and snake venom\nproteases; they cleave peptide bonds in polypeptides such as insulin B chain and\nbradykinin, and in proteins such as casein and gelatin; and they have\narylamidase activity.\n","linknr":191,"url":"Astacin","recorded":1362685833,"links":11,"instances":["chemistry","poison"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Protein domains"],"headings":["Examples","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/PDB_1qjj_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1qjj_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["residue","chemistry"],["venom","poison"]],"members":["residue","venom"],"related":["Metallopeptidase","MEROPS","Protein_folding","Thermolysin","Active_site","Residue_(chemistry)","Gene_activation","Cell_growth","Polypeptides","Extracellular","Protein","Proteins","Protease","Secreted","Cell_membrane","Protein_domain","Zinc","Histidine","Tyrosine","Carboxylate","Side_chain","Alpha_helix","Beta-sheet","Archetypal","Protein_domains","Snake","Venom_(poison)","Peptide_bond","Polypeptides","Insulin","Polymer","ASTL","Bone_morphogenetic_protein_1","MEP1A","MEP1B","TLL1","TLL2"]}
