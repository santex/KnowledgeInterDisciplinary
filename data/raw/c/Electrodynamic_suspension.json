{"cursor":"12741","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Electrodynamic suspension' (EDS) is a form of magnetic levitation in which\nthere are conductors which are exposed to time-varying magnetic fields. This\ninduces eddy currents in the conductors that creates a repulsive magnetic field\nwhich holds the two objects apart.\n\nThese time varying magnetic fields can be caused by relative motion between two\nobjects. In many cases, one magnetic field is a permanent field, such as a\npermanent magnet or a superconducting magnet, and the other magnetic field is\ninduced from the changes of the field that occur as the magnet moves relative to\na conductor in the other object.\n\nElectrodynamic suspension can also occur when an electromagnet driven by an AC\nelectrical source produces the changing magnetic field, in some cases, a linear\ninduction motor generates the field.\n\nEDS is used for maglev trains, such as the Japanese JR-Maglev. It is also used\nfor some classes of magnetically levitated bearings.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Electrodynamic_suspension","recorded":1362535234,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.deboeij.com/docs/TransMag_deboeij_control_3dof_maglev.pdf"],"categories":["Magnetism","Electrodynamics","Magnetic levitation"],"headings":["Types","Uses","Principles","Stability","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Induction_levitation_cropped.jpg/220px-Induction_levitation_cropped.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Linear_motor_field.gif/220px-Linear_motor_field.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4e/Copper_Cylinder_Cut_through.png/220px-Copper_Cylinder_Cut_through.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/JR-Maglev-MLX01-2.jpg/220px-JR-Maglev-MLX01-2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/3/6/b36d404f86aff150dda03b4ddc8a209a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/8/7/8876d2745d8c590a35e6a3e1652579d1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/a/8/7a845f99f12aff8c9a3f4a5f9fa64c99.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Magnetic_levitation","Eddy_current","Magnetic_field","Permanent_magnet","Superconducting_magnet","Linear_induction_motor","Maglev_train","JR-Maglev","Linear_induction_motor","Imperial_College","Passive_component","Fail-safe","Magnetic_levitation","Halbach_array","Magnetic_levitation","Litz_wire","JR-Maglev","Inductrack","Electromagnetic_induction","Linear_motor","Lenz's_law","Faraday's_law_of_induction","Electromotive_Force","Inductive_impedance","Gradient","Diamagnetism","Tuned_mass_damper","Electromagnetic_suspension","Electrodynamic_wheel"]}
