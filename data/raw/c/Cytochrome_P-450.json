CYPs are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and\nbioactivation, accounting for about 75% of the total number of different\nmetabolic reactions.\n\nThe most common reaction catalyzed by cytochromes P450 is a monooxygenase\nreaction, e.g., insertion of one atom of oxygen into an organic substrate (RH)\nwhile the other oxygen atom is reduced to water:  RH + O 2 +\nNADPH + H + â ROH + H 2O + NADP + \n\nCytochromes P450 (CYPs) belong to the superfamily of proteins containing a heme\ncofactor and, therefore, are hemoproteins. CYPs use a variety of small and large\nmolecules as substrates in enzymatic reactions. Often, they form part of multi-\ncomponent electron transfer chains, called P450-containing systems. The letter\nin P450 represents the word pigment as these enzymes are red because of their\nheme group. The number 450 reflects wavelength of the absorption maximum of the\nenzyme when it is in the reduced state and complexed with CO.\n\nCYP enzymes have been identified in all domains of life, i.e., in animals,\nplants, fungi, protists, bacteria, archaea, and even viruses; although it is not\nfound in [[E. coli]]. More than 11,500 distinct CYP proteins are known.\n\nMost CYPs require a protein partner to deliver one or more electrons to reduce\nthe iron (and eventually molecular oxygen). Based on the nature of the electron\ntransfer proteins CYPs can be classified into several groups:\n\n*'Microsomal P450 systems' in which electrons are transferred from NADPH via\ncytochrome P450 reductase (variously CPR, POR, or CYPOR). Cytochrome b5 (cyb5)\ncan also contribute reducing power to this system after being reduced by\ncytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R). *'Mitochondrial P450 systems', that employ\nadrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin to transfer electrons from NADPH to P450.\n*'Bacterial P450 systems', that employ a ferredoxin reductase and a ferredoxin\nto transfer electrons to P450. *'CYB5R/cyb5/P450 systems' in which both\nelectrons required by the CYP come from cytochrome b5. *'FMN/Fd/P450 systems'\noriginally found in Rhodococcus sp. in which a FMN-domain-containing reductase\nis fused to the CYP. *'P450 only' systems, which do not require external\nreducing power. Notable ones include CYP5 (thromboxane synthase), CYP8\n(prostacyclin synthase), and CYP74A (allene oxide synthase).\n","linknr":825,"url":"Cytochrome_P-450","recorded":1362568466,"links":37,"instances":["biochemistry","biology","biochemistry","biology","fungus"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC
