Hurley Copi and Cohen\n\n:Either the breach is a safety violation, or it is not subject to fines. :The\nbreach is not a safety violation. :Therefore, it is not subject to fines.\n\nIn propositional logic, 'disjunctive syllogism' (also known as 'disjunction\nelimination' and 'or elimination', or abbreviated 'â¨E'), Sanford, David\nHawley. 2003. If P, Then Q: Conditionals and the Foundations of Reasoning.\nLondon, UK: Routledge: 39 Hurley Copi and\nCohen Moore and Parker is a valid rule of inference. If we are\ntold that at least one of two statements is true; and also told that it is not\nthe former that is true; we can infer that it has to be the latter that is true.\nIf either P or Q is true and P is false, then Q is true. The reason this is\ncalled \"disjunctive syllogism\" is that, first, it is a syllogism, a three-step\nargument, and second, it contains a logical disjunction, which simply means an\n\"or\" statement. \"Either P or Q\" is a disjunction; P and Q are called the\nstatement's disjuncts. The rule makes it possible to eliminate a disjunction\nfrom a logical proof. It is the rule that:\n\n: \\frac{P \\or Q, \\neg P}{\\therefore Q}\n\nwhere the rule is that whenever instances of \" P \\or Q \", and\n\" \\neg P \" appear on lines of a proof, \" Q\" can be placed\non a subsequent line.\n\nDisjunctive syllogism is closely related and similar to hypothetical syllogism,\nin that it is also type of syllogism, and also the name of a rule of inference.\n","linknr":182,"url":"Disjunctive_syllogism","recorded":1362574689,"links":19,"instances":["logic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rules of inference","Theorems in propositional logic","Classical logic"],"headings":["Formal notation","Natural language examples","Inclusive and exclusive disjunction","Related argument forms","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/d/4/3d4b671d07a16a83e90849d3fc743bda.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/1/121c3226d420a771359523606cbe6a00.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/a/c/faca3e753a7340bc7072a2020888ca51.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/9/f09564c9ca56850d4cd6b3319e541aee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/c/84c49e5a8b55dcee29e9eeb273b7301b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/7/bf73c9341a48c47c84a48dad635ff940.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/9/f09564c9ca56850d4cd6b3319e541aee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/1/121c3226d420a771359523606cbe6a00.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/2/dc218704a88b99d703f219868466a9cd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/6/1/b611c31b254490085933526a90dbf546.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/c/44c29edb103a2872f519ad0c9a0fdaaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/9/f09564c9ca56850d4cd6b3319e541aee.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tautology","logic"]],"members":["tautology"],"related":["Classical_logic","Validity","Argument_form","Syllogism","Logical_disjunction","Premise","Propositional_calculus","Rule_of_inference","Inference","Argument","Logical_disjunction","Formal_proof","Hypothetical_syllogism","Sequent","Metalogic","Logical_consequence","Formal_system","Tautology_(logic)","Theorem","Affirming_a_disjunct","Modus_ponendo_ponens","Modus_ponendo_tollens","Logical_system","Reductio_ad_absurdum","Disjunction_elimination","Hypothetical_syllogism","Categorical_syllogism","Intuitionistic_logic","Paraconsistent_logic"]}
