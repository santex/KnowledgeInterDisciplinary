(2010). Sociology, 7th edition\nSocial stratification is based on four basic principles: (1) Social\nstratification is a trait of society, not simply a reflection of individual\ndifferences; (2) Social stratification carries over from generation to\ngeneration; (3) Social stratification is universal but variable; (4) Social\nstratification involves not just inequality but beliefs as well. Macionis,\nGerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson\nCanada Inc.. pp. 224, 225.\n\nIn modern Western societies, stratification is broadly organized into three main\nlayers: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Each of these classes can be\nfurther subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational).\n\nThese categories are particular to state-based societies as distinguished from\nfeudal societies composed of nobility-to-peasant relations. Stratification may\nalso be defined by kinship ties or castes. For Max Weber, social class\npertaining broadly to material wealth is distinguished from status class which\nis based on such variables as honor, prestige and religious affiliation. Talcott\nParsons argued that the forces of societal differentiation and the following\npattern of institutionalized individualization would strongly diminish the role\nof class (as a major stratification factor) as social evolution went along. It\nis debatable whether the earliest hunter-gatherer groups may be defined as\n'stratified', or if such differentials began with agriculture and broad acts of\nexchange between groups. One of the ongoing issues in determining social\nstratification arises from the point that status inequalities between\nindividuals are common, so it becomes a quantitative issue to determine how much\ninequality qualifies as\nstratification. http://courses.washington.edu/anth457/stratif.htm\n","linknr":659,"url":"Social_stratification","recorded":1362669681,"links":53,"instances":["sociology","human_classification","economics","polity"],"pdf":["http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/03/13/inequality.pdf","http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/03/13/inequality.pdf"],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Anthropology","Anthropological categories of peoples","Other special topics (economics)","Social status","Sociology index"],"headings":["Sociological overview","Anthropological overview","Social impact","Three characteristics of stratified systems","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg/180px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg/10px-Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Logo_sociology.svg/28px-Logo_sociology.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","polity"],["action_theory","sociology"],["capital","economics"],["state","polity"],["race","human_classification"],["action_theory","sociology"]],"members":["action_theory","race","capital","state"],"related":["Sociology","Western_culture","Upper_class","Middle_class","Lower_class","State_(polity)","Feudal","Nobility","Peasant","Kinship","Caste","Max_Weber","Status_class","Talcott_Parsons","Hunter-gatherer","Agriculture","Action_theory_(sociology)","Social_structure","Talcott_Parsons","Universal_value","Functional_prerequisites","Conflict_theory","Marxism","Social_mobility","Working_classes","Upper_class","Exploitation","Proletariat","Ralf_Dahrendorf","Service_economies","Globalization","Dependency_theory","Third_world","Capitalist_mode_of_production","Relations_of_production","Division_of_labour","Means_of_production","Labor_power","Wage_labor","False_consciousness","Arts","Culture","Capitalist","Communist","Marvin_Harris","Tim_Ingold","Richard_Borshay_Lee","Lewis_Henry_Morgan","Friedrich_Engels","Communism","Property","Richard_Borshay_Lee","Ownership","Richard_Borshay_Lee","Max_Weber","Dialectical","Three-component_theory_of_stratification","Life_chances","Structural_functionalism","Marxist","Social_action","Upper_class","White_collar_workers","Petite_bourgeoisie","Working_class","Western_culture","Germany","Capital_(economics)","Jewish","Proletariat","Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation","United_States_Congress","C._Wright_Mills","Power_elite","Marxism","Karl_Marx","C._Wright_Mills","Congress_of_the_United_States","Atomic_bomb","C._Wright_Mills","Harvard_University","Yale_University","Princeton_University","George_W._Bush","John_Kerry","Skull_and_Bones","Presidents_of_the_United_States","Anthropology","Richard_Borshay_Lee","Egalitarian","Acephalous_Society","Kinship","State_(polity)","Reciprocal_altruism","Richard_Borshay_Lee","Khoisan","Indigenous_Australians","Groote_Eylandt","Bickerton_Island","Arnhem_Land","Gift_economy","David_H._Turner","Economics","Original_affluent_society","Teen_suicide","Social_inequality","Race_(human_classification)","Gender","Social_class","American_revolution","U.S._constitution","Declaration_of_Independence","Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Suffrage","Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964","Age_stratification","Caste_system","Capitalism","Class_stratification","Action_theory_(sociology)","Communism","Egalitarianism","Elite_theory","Elitism","Gemeinschaft_and_Gesellschaft","Marxism","Microinequity","Pentagonal_Revisionism","Religious_Stratification","Right-wing_politics","Sexual_field","Split_labor_market_theory","Social_and_economic_stratification_in_Appalachia","Social_class","Social_inequality","Socioeconomic_status","Structure_and_agency","The_Power_Elite","Theodor_Geiger","Wisconsin_model"]}
