Many lighting setups follow Three-point lighting or 4-point lighting\nsetup. 4 Point lighting is the same as 3 Point Lighting with the added addition\nof a background light. In a 4 Point Lighting, the background light is placed\nlast and is usually placed directly behind the subject and pointed at the\nbackground. By adding a background light to a set, filmmakers can add a sense of\ndepth to shots.\n\nIn film, the background light is usually of lower intensity. More than one light\ncould be used to light uniformly a background or alternatively to highlight\npoints of interest.\n\nIn video and television, the background light is usually of similar intensity to\nthe key light because video cameras are less capable of handling high-contrast\nratios. In order to provide much needed separation between subject and\nbackground, the background light will have a color filter, blue for example,\nwhich will make the foreground pop up.\n","linknr":101,"url":"Background_light","recorded":1362898439,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lighting","Cinematography","Photographic techniques"],"headings":["External links and further readings"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ed/Movie_Lighting.jpg/250px-Movie_Lighting.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Video-x-generic.svg/30px-Video-x-generic.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Theatrical_scenery","Three-point_lighting","4-point_lighting_setup","Film","Video","Television","Color_filter"]}
