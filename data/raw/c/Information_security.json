{"cursor":"60598","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", Integrity and Availability (CIA). Information Systems are composed in three\nmain portions, hardware, software and communications with the purpose to help\nidentify and apply information security industry standards, as mechanisms of\nprotection and prevention, at three levels or layers: physical, personal and\norganizational. Essentially, procedures or policies are implemented to tell\npeople (administrators, users and operators) how to use products to ensure\ninformation security within the organizations.]]\n\n'Information security' (sometimes shortened to InfoSec) is the practice of\ndefending information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,\nmodification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction. It is a general\nterm that can be used regardless of the form the data may take (electronic,\nphysical, etc...) (b)(1)\n\nBelow are the typical terms you will hear when dealing with information\nsecurity:\n\n'IT Security' = Sometimes referred to as computer security, IT Security is\ninformation security when applied to technology (most often some form of\ncomputer system). It is worthwhile to note that a computer does not necessarily\nmean a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory\n(even a calculator). IT security specialists are almost always found in any\nmajor enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within\nlarger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within\nthe company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to breach\ninto critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.\n\n'Information Assurance' = The act of ensuring that data is not lost when\ncritical issues arise. These issues include but are not limited to; natural\ndisasters, computer/server malfunction, physical theft, or any other instance\nwhere data has the potential of being lost. Since most information is stored on\ncomputers in our modern era, information assurance is typically dealt with by IT\nsecurity specialists. One of the most common methods of providing information\nassurance is to have an off-site backup of the data in case one of the mentioned\nissues arise.\n\nGovernments, military, corporations, financial institutions, hospitals, and\nprivate businesses amass a great deal of confidential information about their\nemployees, customers, products, research and financial status. Most of this\ninformation is now collected, processed and stored on electronic computers and\ntransmitted across networks to other computers.\n\nShould confidential information about a business' customers or finances or new\nproduct line fall into the hands of a competitor, such a breach of security\ncould lead to Protecting confidential information is a business requirement, and\nin many cases also an ethical and legal requirement.\n\nFor the individual, information security has a significant effect on privacy,\nwhich is viewed very differently in different cultures.\n\nThe field of information security has grown and evolved significantly in recent\nyears. There are many ways of gaining entry into the field as a career. It\noffers many areas for specialization including: securing network(s) and allied\ninfrastructure, securing applications and databases, security testing,\ninformation systems auditing, business continuity planning and digital\nforensics, etc.\n\nThis article presents a general overview of information security and its\ncore concepts.\n","linknr":610,"url":"Information_security","recorded":1362671335,"links":58,"instances":["protocol","computer","computer_scientist","computer","cryptography","computing","computing","networking","telecommunication"],"pdf":["http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27A/SP800-27-RevA.pdf","http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27A/SP800-27-RevA.pdf","http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/22/15582260.pdf","http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27A/SP800-27-RevA.pdf","http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-27A/SP800-27-RevA.pdf","http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf"],"categories":["Data
