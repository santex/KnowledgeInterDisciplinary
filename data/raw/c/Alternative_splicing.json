{"cursor":"42042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Alternative splicing' is a regulated process during gene expression that\nresults in a single gene coding for multiple proteins. In this process,\nparticular exons of a gene may be included within, or excluded from, the final,\nprocessed messenger RNA produced from that gene. Consequently\nthe proteins translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs will contain\ndifferences in their amino acid sequence and, often, in their biological\nfunctions (see Figure). Notably, alternative splicing allows the human genome to\ndirect the synthesis of many more proteins than would be expected from its\n20,000 protein-coding genes. Alternative splicing is sometimes termed\ndifferential splicing, but it does not increase gene expression.\n\nAlternative splicing occurs as a normal phenomenon in eukaryotes, where it\ngreatly increases the biodiversity of proteins that can be encoded by the\ngenome; in humans, ~95% of multiexonic genes are alternatively\nspliced. There are numerous modes of alternative splicing\nobserved, of which the most common is exon skipping. In this mode, a particular\nexon may be included in mRNAs under some conditions or in particular tissues,\nand omitted from the mRNA in others.\n\nThe production of alternatively spliced mRNAs is regulated by a system of trans-\nacting proteins that bind to cis-acting sites on the pre-mRNA itself. Such\nproteins include splicing activators that promote the usage of a particular\nsplice site, and splicing repressors that reduce the usage of a particular site.\nMechanisms of alternative splicing are highly variable, and new examples are\nconstantly being found, particularly through the use of high-throughput\ntechniques. Researchers hope to fully elucidate the regulatory systems involved\nin splicing, so that alternative splicing products from a given gene under\nparticular conditions could be predicted by a \"splicing code\".\n\nAbnormal variations in splicing are also implicated in disease; a large\nproportion of human genetic disorders result from splicing variants. Abnormal splicing variants are also thought to contribute to the\ndevelopment of cancer, although such aberrant splicing products\nare, under normal conditions, usually safeguarded and eliminated by a\nposttranscriptional quality control mechanism.\n","linknr":712,"url":"Alternative_splicing","recorded":1362508463,"links":38,"instances":["biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gene expression","Spliceosome","RNA splicing"],"headings":["Discovery","Modes","Alternative splicing mechanisms","Adaptive significance","Alternative splicing and disease","Genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Splicing_overview.jpg/220px-Splicing_overview.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Alt_splicing_bestiary2.jpg/220px-Alt_splicing_bestiary2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Hyaluronidase3.gif/220px-Hyaluronidase3.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/A_complex.jpg/220px-A_complex.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Splicing_repression.jpg/220px-Splicing_repression.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Splicing_activation.jpg/220px-Splicing_activation.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Dsx_splicing.jpg/220px-Dsx_splicing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Transformer_splicing.gif/220px-Transformer_splicing.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Fas_alternative_splicing.jpg/220px-Fas_alternative_splicing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Tat_exon2_splicing.jpg/220px-Tat_exon2_splicing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["translation","biology"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["promoter","translation"],"related":["Gene_expression","Gene","Proteins","Messenger_RNA","Translation_(biology)","Human_genome","Eukaryote","Trans-acting","Cis-acting","Genetic_disorder","Adenovirus","Polyadenylation","Thyroid","Calcitonin","Calcitonin_gene_related_peptide","Dscam","Reading_frame","Promoter_(biology)","Polyadenylation","Transcriptional_regulation","Hyaluronidase","DNA","Intron","Exon","Nematode","MRNA","Pyrimidine","Polypyrimidine_tract","Spliceosome","SnRNP","U2AF2","Transesterification","Phosphodiester","Trans-acting","Cis-acting","Cis-acting","Trans-acting","RNA-binding_protein","Exonic_splicing_silencer","Heterogeneous_nuclear_ribonucleoprotein","Exonic_splicing_enhancer","SR_protein","Cis-acting","Cis-acting","Trans-acting","Cis-acting","Cis-acting","Polyadenylation","Stop_codon","Sex_lethal","U2AF2","Fas_receptor","Apoptosis","TIA1","HIV","Retrovirus","AIDS","Polypeptide","One_gene-one_enzyme_hypothesis","Eukaryote","Proteome","Genome","Protein_isoform","Intrinsically_unstructured_proteins","Human_Genome_Project","Expressed_sequence_tag","Mutation","Phosphorylation","SF2/ASF","Nonsense-mediated_mRNA_decay","DNMT","DNA_methylation","Proto-oncogene","Cell_motility","Expressed_sequence_tag","DNA_microarray","Reporter_gene","Exon","Affymetrix","CDNA","Deep_sequencing","RNA-Seq","Cross-linking","Immunoprecipitation","AspicDB","SciVee"]}
