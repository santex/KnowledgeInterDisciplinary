{"cursor":"4664","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"s have amphipathic character.]]\n\n\n'Amphiphile' (from the Greek Î±Î¼ÏÎ¹Ï, amphis: both and ÏÎ¹Î»Ã­Î±, philia: love,\nfriendship) is a term describing a chemical compound possessing both hydrophilic\n(water-loving, polar) and lipophilic (fat-loving) properties. Such a compound is\ncalled amphiphilic or amphipathic. This forms the basis for a number of areas of\nresearch in chemistry and biochemistry, notably that of lipid polymorphism.\nOrganic compounds containing hydrophilic groups at 'both' ends of a prolate\nmolecule are called bolaamphiphilic. Common amphiphilic substances are soaps and\ndetergents.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Amphipathic","recorded":1362486480,"links":32,"instances":["biophysics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Soaps","Chemical properties","Zwitterionic surfactants"],"headings":["Structure and Properties","Biological role","Examples of amphiphiles","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Phospholipid.svg/220px-Phospholipid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["polymorphism","biophysics"]],"members":["polymorphism"],"related":["Greek_language","Philia","Chemical_compound","Hydrophilic","Lipophilic","Lipid_polymorphism","Prolate","Bolaamphiphile","Soap","Detergent","Lipophilic","Hydrocarbon","Functional_group","Hydrophilic","Anionic","Carboxylate","Sulfate","Sulfonate","Phosphate","Phospholipids","Cationic","Alcohol","Ethyleneglycol","Proteins","Copolymers","Hydrocarbon","Functional_groups","Apolar","Solvent","Phospholipids","Lipid_bilayer","Phospholipids","Cholesterol","Glycolipids","Pepducin","Hydrocarbon","Surfactants","Ion","Ion","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Anion","Benzalkonium_chloride","Cation","Cocamidopropyl_betaine","Zwitterion","Octanol","Phospholipids","Cholesterol","Glycolipids","Fatty_acids","Bile_acids","Saponins","Hydrophile","Hydrophilic","Wetting","Surface_energy","Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate","Surfactant","Amphipathic_lipids","Polymorphism_(biophysics)"]}
