Formations were found in tribal societies such as the \"pua rere\" of the\nMÄori, 20:32; 27:57, Journal of the Polynesian Society and ancient or\nmedieval formations which include shield walls (skjaldborg in Old Norse),\nphalanxes (lines of battle in close order), Testudo formation and skirmishers.\nTactical formations include:\n* Column\n* Line\n* Square\n* Wedge\n* Echelon\n* Vee\n* Staggered column\n* Coil\n* Herringbone\n\nA vanguard, also known as Avant-garde in French, is the forward element of a\ncolumn formation, and the rear-guard is the rear-most element of the column\nformation. In naval use only \"van\" and \"rear\" are applied to a formation of\nships sailing in column.\n\nExamples of military aircraft tactical formations are the vee formation,\nechelon, the combat box, and the finger-four (also known as the \"fluid four.\")\n\nA tactical formation is not to be confused with military organization or the\ntable of organization and equipment (TOE).\n","linknr":136,"url":"Tactical_formation","recorded":1362375011,"links":24,"instances":["formation","formation","formation","formation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military doctrines","Tactical formations|"],"headings":["See also","References","Sources"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/USN_Amphibious_assault_ships.jpg/250px-USN_Amphibious_assault_ships.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Icon_vojn.svg/30px-Icon_vojn.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["column","formation"],["line","formation"],["coil","formation"],["herringbone","formation"]],"members":["herringbone","coil","line","column"],"related":["Amphibious_assault_ship","Infantry_tactics","Cavalry_tactics","Armoured_fighting_vehicle","Military_aircraft","Navy","Māori_people","Ancient","Medieval","Shield_wall","Old_Norse","Phalanx_formation","Close_order_formation","Testudo_formation","Light_infantry","Column_(formation)","Line_(formation)","Infantry_square","Flying_wedge","Echelon_formation","V_formation","Staggered_column","Coil_(formation)","Herringbone_(formation)","Avant-garde","Vee_formation","Echelon_formation","Combat_box","Finger-four","Military_organization","Table_of_Organization_and_Equipment","Laager","Close_order_formation"]}
