{"cursor":"8690","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'theoretical plate' in many separation processes is a hypothetical zone or\nstage in which two phases, such as the liquid and vapor phases of a substance,\nestablish an equilibrium with each other. Such equilibrium stages may also be\nreferred to as an 'equilibrium stage', 'ideal stage', or a 'theoretical tray'.\nThe performance of many separation processes depends on having a series of\nequilibrium stages and is enhanced by providing more such stages. In other\nwords, having more theoretical plates increases the efficacy of the separation\nprocess be it either a distillation, absorption, chromatographic, adsorption or\nsimilar process.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Theoretical_plate","recorded":1362484285,"links":18,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/P04694.pdf","http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/publications/1999/DistillationTheory/original/distillationtheory.pdf"],"categories":["Distillation","Unit operations","Chemical engineering","Chromatography"],"headings":["Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/3/9839b4651e554a22769104b4538fbefe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/e/48e9b1fb9472180b4ecea4ff24c56487.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/d/4/0d40056f1f81fa144e327f8750c387d5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/a/3/3a3ea00cfc35332cedf6e5e9a32e94da.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Bubble_Cap_Trays.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/1/2/5120b718604b5bd2685e7c578dc8a647.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/d/4/0d40056f1f81fa144e327f8750c387d5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/d/c1d9f50f86825a1a2302ec2449c17196.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/c/3/fc3d5c8f4e6d50fb0ae0fd38a271053c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/1/2/5120b718604b5bd2685e7c578dc8a647.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["absorption","chemistry"],["absorption","chemistry"]],"members":["absorption"],"related":["Separation_process","Liquid","Vapor","Vapor-liquid_equilibrium","Distillation","Absorption_(chemistry)","Chromatography","Adsorption","Distillation","Fractionating_column","Vigreux_column","Weir","Flash_evaporation","Vapor-liquid_equilibrium","Reflux","Absorption_(chemistry)","Packed_bed","Raschig_ring","Structured_packing","Mass_transfer","Chromatography","Archer_John_Porter_Martin","Richard_Laurence_Millington_Synge","IUPAC","Gold_Book","Van_Deemter_equation","Capillary_electrophoresis","Adsorption","Batch_distillation","Continuous_distillation","Extractive_distillation","Fenske_equation","Fractional_distillation","McCabe-Thiele_Method"]}
