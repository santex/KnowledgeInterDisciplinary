Mixing different 'earpoints' produces a 'way of\nhearing [that] is an acoustic expectation for anyone who listens to contemporary\nrecordings. It cannot be achieved without the aid of electronic devices. It has\nnever before existed on earth' (ibid, p. 119).\" (Middleton 1990,\np. 88)\n","linknr":88,"url":"Recording_consciousness","recorded":1362580106,"links":11,"instances":["phenomenon","music"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Popular music","Sound"],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["echo","phenomenon"],["texture","music"]],"members":["echo","texture"],"related":["Popular_music","Acoustic_instrument","Live_music","Musical_composition","Sheet_music","Reverberation","Echo_(phenomenon)","Timbre","Texture_(music)","Bassline","Polyvocal","Multitrack_recording","University_of_Massachusetts_Press"]}
