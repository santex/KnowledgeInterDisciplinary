The word\n\"science\" comes from the Latin word \"scientia\" meaning knowledge. A practitioner\nof science is called a \"scientist\". Modern science respects objective logical\nreasoning, and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine\nthe nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it.\nSome scientists do not know of the rules themselves, but follow them through\nresearch policies. These procedures are known as scientific method.\n","recorded":1362124713,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"1127","instances":["disambiguation","mathematics","academic_field","linguistics","linguistics","science","statistics","mathematics","computer_science","linguistics","statistics","soil_study","mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Outlines|Science","Science","Science-related
