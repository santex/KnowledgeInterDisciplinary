{"cursor":"26508","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Molecular cloning' is a set of experimental methods in molecular biology\nthat are used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their\nreplication within host organisms. The\nuse of the word [[cloning]] refers to the fact that the method involves the\nreplication of a single DNA molecule starting from a single living cell to\ngenerate a large population of cells containing identical DNA molecules.\nMolecular cloning generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms:\nthe species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned, and the species that\nwill serve as the living host for replication of the recombinant DNA.\nMolecular cloning methods are central to many contemporary areas of modern\nbiology and medicine.\n\nIn a conventional molecular cloning experiment, the DNA to be cloned is obtained\nfrom an organism of interest, then treated with enzymes in the test tube to\ngenerate smaller DNA fragments. Subsequently, these fragments are then combined\nwith vector DNA to generate recombinant DNA molecules. The recombinant DNA is\nthen introduced into a host organism (typically an easy-to-grow, benign,\nlaboratory strain of [[E. coli]] bacteria). This will generate a population of\norganisms in which recombinant DNA molecules are replicated along with the host\nDNA. Because they contain foreign DNA fragments, these are transgenic or genetically-\nmodified microorganisms (GMO). This process\ntakes advantage of the fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take\nup and replicate a single recombinant DNA molecule. This single cell can then be\nexpanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which\ncontain copies of the original recombinant molecule. Thus, both the resulting\nbacterial population, and the recombinant DNA molecule, are commonly referred to\nas \"clones\". Strictly speaking, recombinant DNA refers to DNA molecules, while\nmolecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them.\n","linknr":327,"url":"Molecular_cloning","recorded":1362480551,"links":25,"instances":["biology","genetics","genetics","genetics","molecular_biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics","Molecular biology"],"headings":["History of molecular cloning","Overview","Steps in molecular cloning","Applications of molecular cloning","Production of recombinant proteins","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Gene_cloning.svg/350px-Gene_cloning.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["host","biology"],["host","biology"],["vector","molecular_biology"],["transformation","genetics"],["transduction","genetics"],["transformation","genetics"],["competence","biology"],["transduction","genetics"],["pharming","genetics"]],"members":["competence","pharming","transduction","transformation","vector","host"],"related":["Molecular_biology","Recombinant_DNA","DNA_replication","Host_(biology)","Host_(biology)","Recombinant_DNA","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Transgenic","Genetically_modified_organism","Restriction_enzyme","Ligase","Recombinant_DNA","DNA","DNA_replication","Recombinant_DNA","Transgenic","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Escherichia_coli","Plasmid_vector","Bacterial_artificial_chromosome","Yeast_artificial_chromosome","Expression_vector","Shuttle_vector","Subcloning","DNA_end","EcoRI","Blue_white_screen","Alkaline_phosphatase","Quagga","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction","Complementary_DNA","Artificial_gene_synthesis","DNA_ligase","Ligation","Transformation_(genetics)","Transduction_(genetics)","Transfection","Electroporation","Transformation_(genetics)","Competence_(biology)","Transfection","Electroporation","Transduction_(genetics)","Selectable_marker","Antibiotic","Ampicillin","Geneticin","PUC19","Blue_white_screen","Beta-galactosidase","DNA_library","Southern_blot","Western_blot","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism","DNA_sequencing","Molecular_probe","Gene_expression_profiling","Knockout_mouse","Site-directed_mutagenesis","List_of_recombinant_proteins","Factor_VIII","Hemophilia","Humulin","Diabetes","Tissue_plasminogen_activator","Hepatitis_B_vaccine","Genetically_modified_organisms","Transgenic_mouse","Pharming_(genetics)","GloFish"]}
