The film magazines had to be changed out by the\ncrew during spacewalks.\n\nThe ATM was designed and construction was managed at NASA's Marshall Space\nFlight Center. [http://www.nasm.si.edu/spacecraft/SS-ATM.htm Smithsonian SS-\nATM page (Dead Link)] It included eight major observational instruments,\nalong with several lesser experiments. The ATM made observations at a variety of\nwavelengths, from extreme ultraviolet to infrared.\n\nAs of 2006, the original exposures were on file (and accessible to interested\nparties) at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C..\n","linknr":392,"url":"Apollo_Telescope_Mount","recorded":1362267862,"links":34,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770081341_1977081341.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790073384_1979073384.pdf"],"categories":["Apollo program hardware","Skylab program","Manned space observatories"],"headings":["History","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Skylab_IV-view_of_telescope.jpg/250px-Skylab_IV-view_of_telescope.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Owen_Garriott_at_the_Apollo_Telescope_Mount_console.jpg/250px-Owen_Garriott_at_the_Apollo_Telescope_Mount_console.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Apollo_program_insignia.png/80px-Apollo_program_insignia.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/TheSun.png/150px-TheSun.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sun","Observatory","Skylab","Space_station","Photographic_film","Extra-vehicular_activity","NASA","Marshall_Space_Flight_Center","Ultraviolet","Infrared","Naval_Research_Laboratory","Washington,_D.C.","Apollo_Applications_Program","Apollo_program","Wet_workshop","Apollo_Command/Service_Module","Apollo_Lunar_Module","Saturn_V"]}
