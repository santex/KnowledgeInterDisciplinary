{"cursor":"20272","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n require tools from combinatorial optimization and integer programming.]]\n 'Applied mathematics' is a branch of mathematics that concerns itself with\n mathematical methods that are typically used in science, engineering, business,\n and industry. Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a mathematical science with\n specialized knowledge. The term \"applied mathematics\" also describes the\n professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a\n profession focused on practical problems, applied mathematics focuses on the\n formulation and study of mathematical models. In the past, practical\n applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which\n then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is\n developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics\n is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics.\n","linknr":539,"url":"Applied_mathematics","recorded":1362511751,"links":76,"instances":["graph_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","summary"],"pdf":["http://www.springerlink.com/index/T152575218M865W4.pdf","http://www.springerlink.com/index/T152575218M865W4.pdf"],"categories":["Applied
