{"cursor":"3059","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In economics, the 'consumption function' is a single mathematical function used\nto express consumer spending. It was developed by John Maynard Keynes and\ndetailed most famously in his book [[The General Theory of Employment, Interest,\nand Money]]. The function is used to calculate the amount of total consumption\nin an economy. It is made up of '[[autonomous consumption]]' that is not\ninfluenced by current income and '[[induced consumption]]' that is influenced by\nthe economy's income level. This function can be written in a variety of ways,\nan example being  C = a + b(Y-T) . This is probably the most\nsimplistic form of the consumption function.\n\nThe simple consumption function is shown as the affine function:\n\n: C = c_0 + c_1 Y^d\nwhere\n* C = total consumption,\n* c 0 = autonomous consumption (c 0 > 0),\n* c 1 is the marginal propensity to consume (ie the induced\n  consumption) (0 1 d = disposable income (income after government intervention â\n  benefits, taxes and transfer payments â or Y + (G â T)).\n\nAutonomous consumption represents consumption when income is zero. In\nestimation, this is usually assumed to be positive. The marginal propensity to\nconsume (MPC), on the other hand measures the rate at which consumption is\nchanging when income is changing. In a geometric fashion, the MPC is actually\nthe slope of the consumption function.\n\nThe MPC is assumed to be positive. Thus, as income increases, consumption\nincreases. However, Keynes mentioned that the increases (for income and\nconsumption) are not equal. According to him, \"as income increases, consumption\nincreases but not by as much as the increase in income\".\n\nThe Keynesian consumption function is also known as the absolute income\nhypothesis, as it only bases consumption on current income and ignores potential\nfuture income (or lack of). Criticism of this assumption lead to the development\nof Milton Friedman's permanent income hypothesis and Franco Modigliani's life\ncycle hypothesis. More recent theoretical approaches D'Orlando, F. and\nSanfilippo, E. (2010). Behavioral foundations for the Keynesian Consumption\nFunction, in Journal of Economic Psychology, 31 (6), pp. 1035-1046 are\nbased on behavioral economics and suggest that a number of behavioural\nprinciples can be taken as microeconomic foundations for a behaviourally-based\naggregate consumption function.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Consumption_function","recorded":1362585089,"links":24,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":["http://www.economic-truth.co.uk/content-essays/bsc/keynesconsumption.pdf"],"categories":["Macroeconomics"],"headings":["See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/0/d/b0d95c90f7ea8e5e111109e2dd451c80.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/9/4/294eea52859bf1af7e271416474fad5d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Usdollar100front.jpg/40px-Usdollar100front.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["consumption","economics"],["consumption","economics"]],"members":["consumption"],"related":["Economics","Consumer_spending","John_Maynard_Keynes","Consumption_(economics)","Economics","Affine_function","Marginal_propensity_to_consume","Absolute_income_hypothesis","Milton_Friedman","Permanent_income_hypothesis","Franco_Modigliani","Life_cycle_hypothesis","Aggregate_demand","Consumption_(economics)","Life_cycle_hypothesis","Measures_of_national_income_and_output","Permanent_income_hypothesis"]}
