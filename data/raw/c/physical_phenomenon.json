New Oxford American Dictionary (2nd ed.) Phenomena are\noften, but not always, understood as 'appearances' or 'experiences'. These are\nthemselves sometimes understood as involving qualia.\n\nThe term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who\ncontrasted it with the noumenon (for which he used the term Ding an sich, or\n\"thing-in-itself\"). In contrast to a phenomenon, a noumenon is not directly\naccessible to observation. Kant was heavily influenced by Leibniz in this part\nof his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated\ntechnical terms.\n\n phenomena. Scientists use phenomena to refine some hypotheses and sometimes to\n disprove a theory.
