ÎºÏÏÎ¿Ï\n\"receptacle\") is the durable process by which a cell directs the contents of\nsecretory vesicles out of the cell membrane and into the extracellular space.\nThese membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the\nextracellular environment, as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent\nto become components of the cell membrane. However, the mechanism of the\nsecretion of intra-vesicular contents out of the cell is very different from the\nincorporation of ion channels, signaling molecules, or receptors at the cell\nmembrane. While for membrane recycling and the incorporation of ion channels,\nsignaling molecules, or receptors at the cell membrane complete membrane merger\nis required, for cell secretion there is transient vesicle fusion with the cell\nmembrane in a process called exocytosis, dumping its contents out of the cell's\nenvironment. Examination of cells following secretion using electron microscopy,\ndemonstrate increased presence of partially empty vesicles following secretion.\nThis suggested that during the secretory process, only a portion of the\nvesicular content is able to exit the cell. This could only be possible if the\nvesicle were to temporarily establish continuity with the cell plasma membrane,\nexpel a portion of its contents, then detach, reseal, and withdraw into the\ncytosol (endocytose). In this way, the secretory vesicle could be reused for\nsubsequent rounds of exo-endocytosis, until completely empty of its contents.\nand how it does its role in the cell.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Exocytosis","recorded":1362486565,"links":46,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cellular processes","Neurophysiology"],"headings":["Types","Steps","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Synapse_diag1.svg/300px-Synapse_diag1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vesicle","biology"],["vesicle","biology"]],"members":["vesicle"],"related":["Synaptic_vesicle","Neurotransmitters","Synapse","Serotonin","Calcium_channel","Greek_language","Vesicle_(biology)","Cell_membrane","Proteins","Membrane_proteins","Lipids","Vesicle_fusion","Cell_membrane","Chemical_synapse","Extracellular_matrix","Cell_membrane","Vesicle_(biology)","Clathrin","Endocytosis","Golgi_apparatus","Molecular_motors","Neurotransmitter","SNARE","Toxin","Hormone","Neurotransmitter","Synaptic_transmission","Protein","Secretory_pathway","Synapse","Kiss-and-run_fusion","Endocytosis","Phagocytosis","Endocytic_cycle","Membrane_nanotube","Active_Transport","Viral_shedding","Active_zone","Residual_body"]}
