{"cursor":"44958","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Muscle' is a kind of soft tissue of animals. Muscle cells contain protein\nfilaments that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both\nthe length and the shape of the cell. Muscles function to produce force and\ncause motion. They are primarily responsible for maintenance of and changes in\nposture, locomotion of the organism itself, as well as movement of internal\norgans, such as the contraction of the heart and movement of food through the\ndigestive system via peristalsis.\n\nMuscle tissues are derived from the mesodermal layer of embryonic germ cells.\nThey are classified as skeletal, cardiac, or smooth muscles. Cardiac and smooth\nmuscle contraction occurs without conscious thought and is necessary for\nsurvival. Voluntary contraction of the skeletal muscles is used to move the body\nand can be finely controlled. Examples are movements of the eye, or gross\nmovements like the quadriceps muscle of the thigh.\n\nMuscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates,\nbut anaerobic chemical reactions are also used, particularly by fast twitch\nfibers. These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules\nwhich are used to power the movement of the myosin heads.\n\nThe term muscle is derived from the Latin musculus meaning \"little mouse\"\nperhaps because of the shape of certain muscles or because contracting muscles\nlook like mice moving under the skin.\n","linknr":1508,"url":"Muscular_tissue","recorded":1362485107,"links":142,"instances":["anatomy","physics","biology","anatomy","biology","biology","biochemistry","unit"],"pdf":["http://www.concept2.com/us/support/manuals/pdf/B_UsersManual.pdf","http://www.concept2.com/us/support/manuals/pdf/B_UsersManual.pdf","http://www.umbi.umd.edu/~collins/myoinformatics/muscle-evolution.pdf","http://www.umbi.umd.edu/~collins/myoinformatics/muscle-evolution.pdf"],"categories":["Exercise
