The release is regulated by\na voltage-dependent calcium channel. Vesicles are essential for propagating\nnerve impulses between neurons and are constantly recreated by the cell. The\narea in the axon that holds groups of vesicles is an axon terminal or \"bouton\".\nUp to 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over a ten-minute period of\nstimulation at 0.2 Hz.
