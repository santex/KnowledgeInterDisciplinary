{"cursor":"46234","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Health informatics' (also called 'Health Information Systems', 'health care\ninformatics', 'healthcare informatics', 'medical informatics', 'nursing\ninformatics', 'clinical informatics', or 'biomedical informatics') is a\ndiscipline at the intersection of information science, computer science, and\nhealth care. It deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to\noptimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health\nand biomedicine. Health informatics tools include computers, clinical\nguidelines, formal medical terminologies, and information and communication\nsystems. It is applied to the areas of nursing, clinical care, dentistry,\npharmacy, public health, occupational therapy, and (bio)medical research.\n* The international standards on the subject are covered by ICS 35.240.80 in which ISO 27799:2008 is one of the core components.\n* Molecular bioinformatics and clinical informatics have converged into the\n  field of translational bioinformatics.\n","linknr":616,"url":"Biomedical_informatics","recorded":1362505363,"links":45,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-04-30/pdf/04-10024.pdf","http://sl.infoway-inforoute.ca/downloads/Ross_Fraser_-_ISO_27799.pdf","http://sl.infoway-inforoute.ca/downloads/Ross_Fraser_-_ISO_27799.pdf","http://homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~peterk/healthinformatics/tec-hi-report-06.pdf","http://homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~peterk/healthinformatics/tec-hi-report-06.pdf","http://piim.newschool.edu/_media/pdfs/PIIM-RESEARCH_AdvancingMeaningfulUse.pdf"],"categories":["Health
