{"cursor":"3380","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics and computer science, a 'string metric' (also known as a 'string\nsimilarity metric' or 'string distance function') is a metric that measures\nsimilarity or dissimilarity (distance) between two text strings for approximate\nstring matching or comparison and in fuzzy string searching. For example the\nstrings \"Sam\" and \"Samuel\" can be considered to be similar. A string metric\nprovides a number indicating an algorithm-specific indication of similarity.\n\nThe most widely known string metric is a rudimentary one called the Levenshtein\nDistance (also known as Edit Distance). It operates between two input strings,\nreturning a score equivalent to the number of substitutions and deletions needed\nin order to transform one input string into another. Simplistic string metrics\nsuch as Levenshtein distance have expanded to include phonetic, token,\ngrammatical and character-based methods of statistical comparisons.\n\nA widespread example of a string metric is DNA sequence analysis and RNA\nanalysis, which are performed by optimised string metrics to identify matching\nsequences.\n\nString metrics are used heavily in information integration and are currently\nused in areas including fraud detection, fingerprint analysis, plagiarism\ndetection, ontology merging, DNA analysis, RNA analysis, image analysis, evidence-\nbased machine learning, database data deduplication, data mining, Web\ninterfaces, e.g. Ajax-style suggestions as you type, data integration, and\nsemantic knowledge integration.\n","linknr":144,"url":"String_metric","recorded":1362671831,"links":12,"instances":["programming","mathematics","computer_science","parser"],"pdf":[],"categories":["String similarity measures|"],"headings":["List of string metrics","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["metric","mathematics"],["string","computer_science"],["token","parser"],["ajax","programming"]],"members":["ajax","metric","string","token"],"related":["Mathematics","Computer_science","Metric_(mathematics)","Distance","String_(computer_science)","Approximate_string__matching","Fuzzy_string_searching","Levenshtein_distance","Levenshtein_distance","Token_(parser)","DNA","Sequence_analysis","Information_integration","Fraud_detection","Fingerprint_analysis","Plagiarism_detection","Ontology_merging","DNA_analysis","Image_analysis","Database","Data_deduplication","Data_mining","Ajax_(programming)","Data_integration","Knowledge_integration","Hamming_distance","Levenshtein_distance","Damerau–Levenshtein_distance","Needleman–Wunsch_algorithm","Sellers'_algorithm","Smith–Waterman_algorithm","FASTA","BLAST","Gotoh_distance","Monge_Elkan_distance","Block_distance","L1_distance","City_block_distance","Jaro–Winkler_distance","Soundex","Simple_matching_coefficient","Dice's_coefficient","Jaccard_similarity","Jaccard_coefficient","Tanimoto_coefficient","Tversky_index","Overlap_coefficient","Euclidean_distance","L2_distance","Cosine_similarity","Variational_distance","Hellinger_distance","Bhattacharyya_distance","Information_radius","Jensen–Shannon_divergence","Harmonic_mean","Skew_divergence","Confusion_probability","Tau_metric","Kullback–Leibler_divergence","Fellegi_and_Sunters_metric","TFIDF","Maximal_matches","Lee_distance","Approximate_string__matching","String_matching"]}
