{"cursor":"58138","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n.]]\n\n\nIn medicine, a 'prosthesis', 'prosthetic', or 'prosthetic limb' (from Ancient\nGreek prÃ³sthesis, \"addition, application, attachment\") is an\nartificial device extension that replaces a missing body part. It is part of the\nfield of biomechatronics, the science of using mechanical devices with human\nmuscle, skeleton, and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by\ntrauma, disease, or defect. Prostheses are generally used to replace parts lost\nby injury (traumatic) or missing from birth (congenital) or to supplement\ndefective body parts. Inside the body, artificial heart valves are in common use\nwith artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active\ntechnology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered\nprosthetics include hearing aids, artificial eyes, palatal obturator, gastric\nbands, and dentures.\n\nProsthetics are specifically not orthotics, although given certain circumstances\na prosthetic might end up performing some or all of the same functionary\nbenefits as an orthotic. Prostheses are technically the complete finished item.\nFor instance, a C-Leg knee alone is not a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic\npart. The complete prosthesis would consist of the stump attachment system -\nusually a \"socket\", and all the attachment hardware parts all the way down to\nand including the foot. Keep this in mind as often nomenclature is interchanged.\n","linknr":706,"url":"Prosthetics","recorded":1362510173,"links":78,"instances":["computing","magazine","dentistry","medicine"],"pdf":["http://www.oandplibrary.org/cpo/pdf/1985_04_009.pdf","http://www.oandplibrary.org/cpo/pdf/1985_04_009.pdf","http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0868/$File/Eng-Transfemoral.pdf","http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0868/$File/Eng-Transfemoral.pdf"],"categories":["Prosthetics|
