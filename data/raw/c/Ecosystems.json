This is the Gambia River in Senegal's Niokolo-Koba National\nPark.]] An 'ecosystem' is a community of living organisms (plants, animals and\nmicrobes) in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment\n(things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a\nsystem. Tansley (1934); Molles (1999), p. 482; Chapin et al. (2002), p.\n380; Schulze et al. (2005); p. 400; Gurevitch et al. (2006), p. 522; Smith &\nSmith 2012, p. G-5 These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as\nlinked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition,\nSaunders New York As ecosystems are defined by the network of\ninteractions among organisms, and between organisms and their environment, Schulze et al. (2005), p.400 they can come in any size\nbut usually encompass specific, limited spaces Chapin et al. (2002), p.\n380; Schulze et al. (2005); p. 400 (although some scientists say that\nthe entire planet is an ecosystem). Willis (1997), p.269;\nChapin et al. (2002), p. 5; Krebs (2009). p. 572\n\nEnergy, water, nitrogen and soil minerals are other essential abiotic\ncomponents of an ecosystem. The energy that flows through ecosystems is\nobtained primarily from the sun. It generally enters the system through\nphotosynthesis, a process that also captures carbon from the atmosphere. By\nfeeding on plants and on one another, animals play an important role in the\nmovement of matter and energy through the system. They also influence the\nquantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic\nmatter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate\nnutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form\nthat can be readily used by plants and other microbes. Chapin et al. (2002), p. 10\n\nEcosystems are controlled both by external and internal factors. External\nfactors such as climate, the parent material which forms the soil and\ntopography, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things\nwork within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. Chapin et al. (2002), pp. 11â13 Other external factors include\ntime and potential biota. Ecosystems are dynamic entitiesâinvariably, they are\nsubject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some\npast disturbance. Ecosystems in similar environments\nthat are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very\ndifferently simply because they have different pools of species present. The introduction of non-native species can cause substantial\nshifts in ecosystem function. Internal factors not only control ecosystem\nprocesses but are also controlled by them and are often subject to feedback\nloops. While the resource inputs are generally\ncontrolled by external processes like climate and parent material, the\navailability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal\nfactors like decomposition, root competition or shading.\nOther internal factors include disturbance, succession and the types of species\npresent. Although humans exist and operate within ecosystems, their cumulative\neffects are large enough to influence external factors like climate.\n\nBiodiversity affects ecosystem function, as do the processes of disturbance and\nsuccession. Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people\ndepend; the principles of ecosystem management suggest that rather than managing\nindividual species, natural resources should be managed at the level of the\necosystem itself. Classifying ecosystems into ecologically homogeneous units is\nan important step towards effective ecosystem management, but there is no\nsingle, agreed-upon way to do this.\n","linknr":1241,"url":"Ecosystems","recorded":1362509680,"links":132,"instances":["geographer","agriculture","ecology","state","ecology","systems","biology","ecology","ecology","ecology","new_hampshire","ecology","ecology"],"pdf":["http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/47/2/04_brown_goods.pdf","http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/47/2/04_brown_goods.pdf","http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6920_spring2010/readings/Grumbine_1994.pdf","http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6920_spring2010/readings/Grumbine_1994.pdf","http://carmelacanzonieri.com/library/6108-LandscapeEcoPlanning/Brussard-EnvMgmntWhatIsIt.pdf","http://carmelacanzonieri.com/library/6108-LandscapeEcoPlanning/Brussard-EnvMgmntWhatIsIt.pdf","http://www.ci.uri.edu/CIIP/SummerPracticum/Docs2007/Likens_LongTermResearch_Ecology2004.pdf","http://www.ci.uri.edu/CIIP/SummerPracticum/Docs2007/Likens_LongTermResearch_Ecology2004.pdf","http://www.fs.fed.us/global/iitf/pubs/ja_iitf_1999_lugo002.pdf","http://www.fs.fed.us/global/iitf/pubs/ja_iitf_1999_lugo002.pdf"],"categories":["Ecosystems|","Biological
