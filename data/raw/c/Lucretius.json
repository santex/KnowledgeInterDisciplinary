His only known work is the epic philosophical poem [[De rerum\nnatura]] about the beliefs of Epicureanism, and which is translated into English\nas On the Nature of Things or \"On the Nature of the Universe\".\n\nVirtually nothing is known about the life of Lucretius. Jerome tells how he was\ndriven mad by a love potion and wrote his poetry between fits of insanity,\neventually committing suicide in middle age; but modern scholarship suggests\nthis account was likely an invention. The De rerum natura was a considerable\ninfluence on the Augustan poets, particularly Virgil (in his [[Aeneid]] and\n[[Georgics]], and to a lesser extent in his [[Eclogues]]) and Horace. It\nvirtually disappeared during the Middle Ages, but was rediscovered in a\nmonastery in Germany in 1417, by Poggio Bracciolini, and played an important\nrole both in the development of atomism (Lucretius was an important influence on\nPierre Gassendi) and the efforts of various figures of the Enlightenment era to\nconstruct a new Christian humanism.\n","linknr":660,"url":"Lucretius","recorded":1362483103,"links":72,"instances":["poet","gens"],"pdf":[],"categories":["99 BC births","55 BC deaths","1st-century BC philosophers","1st-century BC poets","1st-century BC Romans","Classical humanists","Didactic poets","Epic poets","Golden Age Latin writers","Roman-era philosophers","Roman-era Epicurean philosophers","Roman-era poets"],"headings":["Life","De Rerum Natura","Notes","References","Bibliography","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["gaius_memmius","poet"],["lucretia","gens"]],"members":["gaius_memmius","lucretia"],"related":["Hellenistic_philosophy","Epicureanism","Ethics","Metaphysics","Democritus","Epicurus","Empedocles","Epicureanism","Cicero","Ovid","Virgil","George_Santayana","Roman_Republic","Poet","Philosopher","Epicureanism","Jerome","Virgil","Horace","Middle_Ages","Monastery","Germany","Poggio_Bracciolini","Atomism","Pierre_Gassendi","Christian_humanism","Patronage_in_ancient_Rome","Gaius_Memmius_(poet)","Cicero","Quintus_Tullius_Cicero","Virgil","Aelius_Donatus","Suetonius","Roman_consul","Fl.","Pompey","Marcus_Licinius_Crassus","Jerome","Olympiad","Potion","Rome","Roman_civil_wars","Lucretia_(gens)","Physics","Atomism","Psychology","Project_Gutenberg"]}
