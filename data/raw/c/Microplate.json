{"cursor":"8061","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'Microtitre plate' (spelled microtiter in the United States) or 'microplate'\nor 'microwell plate', http://www.corporeality.net/museion/category/medical-scientific-\ninstruments/ is a flat plate with multiple \"wells\" used as small test\ntubes. The microplate has become a standard tool in analytical research and\nclinical diagnostic testing laboratories. A very common usage is in the enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the basis of most modern medical diagnostic\ntesting in humans and animals.\n\nA microplate typically has 6, 24, 96, 384 or even 1536 sample wells arranged in\na 2:3 rectangular matrix. Some microplates have even been manufactured with 3456\nor even 9600 wells, and an \"array tape\" product has been developed that provides\na continuous strip of microplates embossed on a flexible plastic\ntape.\n\nEach well of a microplate typically holds somewhere between tens of nanolitres\nto several millilitres of liquid. They can also be used to store dry powder or\nas racks to support glass tube inserts. Wells can be either circular or square.\nFor compound storage applications, square wells with close fitting silicone cap-\nmats are preferred. Microplates can be stored at low temperatures for long\nperiods, may be heated to increase the rate of solvent evaporation from their\nwells and can even be heat-sealed with foil or clear film. Microplates with an\nembedded layer of filter material were developed in the early 1990s by several\ncompanies, and today, there are microplates for just about every application in\nlife Science research which involves filtration, separation, optical detection,\nstorage, reaction mixing or cell culture.\n\nThe enormous growth in studies of whole live cells has led to an entirely new\nrange of microplate products which are \"tissue culture treated\" especially for\nthis work. The surfaces of these products are modified using a plasma discharge\nto make them easier for adherent cells to grow on.\n\nA number of companies have developed robots to specifically handle SBS\nmicroplates. These robots may be liquid handlers which aspirate or dispense\nliquid samples from and to these plates, or \"plate movers\" which transport them\nbetween instruments, plate stackers which store microplates during these\nprocesses, plate hotels for longer term storage or microplate incubators to\nensure constant temperature during testing. Instrument companies have designed\nplate readers which can detect specific biological, chemical or physical events\nin samples stored in these plates.\n","linknr":231,"url":"Microplate","recorded":1362481351,"links":28,"instances":["physics","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1992/A1992JC14700001.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1992/A1992JC14700001.pdf","http://www.biotek.com/resources/docs/Necessity_is_the_mother_of_invention_GIT-Verlag.pdf"],"categories":["Laboratory equipment"],"headings":["Manufacture and composition","History","References","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Microplates.jpg/300px-Microplates.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/BioTek_ELx405_Washer022310.jpg/300px-BioTek_ELx405_Washer022310.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["matrix","mathematics"],["plasma","physics"]],"members":["plasma","matrix"],"related":["ELISA","Rectangle","Matrix_(mathematics)","Tissue_culture","Plasma_(physics)","Adherent_cell","Robot","Plate_reader","Polystyrene","Titanium_dioxide","Absorbance","Luminescence","Carbon","Fluorescent","Polypropylene","Chemical_compound","Polycarbonate","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Desoxyribonucleic_acid","Cyclo-olefins","Ultraviolet","Injection_moulding","Solid_Phase_Extraction","Gyula_Tak√°tsy","Acrylic_glass","Society_for_Biomolecular_Sciences","American_National_Standards_Institute","Diameter","Thickness","Interoperability","Laboratory_automation"]}
