According to\nNielsen (2008) a dictionary may be regarded as a lexicographical product that is\ncharacterised by three significant features: (1) it has been prepared for one or\nmore functions; (2) it contains data that have been selected for the purpose of\nfulfilling those functions; and (3) its lexicographic structures link and\nestablish relationships between the data so that they can meet the needs of\nusers and fulfill the functions of the dictionary.\n\nA broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries.\nSpecialized dictionaries do not contain information about words that are used in\nlanguage for general purposes—words used by ordinary people in everyday\nsituations. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually\ncalled terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology\nand terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general\ndictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition,\nwhile specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first\nidentifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In\npractice, the two approaches are used for both types. Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 155â157 There are other types\nof dictionaries that don't fit neatly in the above distinction, for instance\nbilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), or\nrhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to\nrefer to a monolingual general-purpose dictionary. Sterkenburg\n2003, pp. 3â4\n\nA different dimension on which dictionaries (usually just general-purpose ones)\nare sometimes distinguished is whether they are ''prescriptive'' or\n''descriptive'', the latter being in theory largely based on linguistic corpus\nstudies—this is the case of most modern dictionaries. However, this\ndistinction cannot be upheld in the strictest sense. The choice of headwords is\nconsidered itself of prescriptive nature; for instance, dictionaries avoid\nhaving too many taboo words in that position. Stylistic indications (e.g.\nâinformalâ or âvulgarâ) present in many modern dictionaries is considered less\nthan objectively descriptive as well. Sterkenburg 2003, p. 7\n\nAlthough the first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times (these were\nbilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of\nscientific interest themselves is a 20th century enterprise, called\nlexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. The\nbirth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-\nmakers being sometimes accused of \"astonishing\" lack of method and critical-self\nreflection.\n","linknr":681,"url":"Dictionary","recorded":1362554520,"links":128,"instances":["website","philologist","website","optics","morphology","linguistics","littré"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Dictionaries|","Lexicography","Reference
