{"cursor":"2047","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Ribonucleoprotein (RNP)' is a nucleoprotein that contains RNA, i.e. it is an\nassociation that combines ribonucleic acid and protein together. A few known\nexamples include the ribosome, the enzyme telomerase, vault ribonucleoproteins,\nRNase P, hnRNP and small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), which are implicated in pre-mRNA\nsplicing (spliceosome) and are among the main components of the nucleolus. 'RNP'\ncan also refer to ribonucleoprotein particles, distinct intracellular foci for\npost-transcriptional regulation.\n\nRNP in snRNPs has an RNA-binding motif in its RNA-binding protein. Aromatic\namino acid residues in this motif result in stacking interactions with RNA.\nLysine residues in the helical portion of RNA-binding proteins help to stabilize\ninteractions with nucleic acids. This nucleic acid binding is strengthened by\nelectrostatic attraction between the positive lysine side chains and the\nnegative nucleic acid phosphate backbones.\n\nRNPs play an important role in influenzavirus A replication. The viral RNA is\ntranscribed into mRNAs by the RNA polymerase attached to the RNPs.\n","linknr":242,"url":"Ribonucleoprotein","recorded":1362901341,"links":21,"instances":["organelle","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cell biology"],"headings":["Anti-RNP antibodies","List of RNPs","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vault","organelle"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["vault","transcription"],"related":["Nucleoprotein","RNA","Ribonucleic_acid","Protein","Ribosome","Telomerase","Vault_(organelle)","RNase_P","HnRNP","SnRNP","Pre-mRNA","RNA_splicing","Spliceosome","Nucleolus","Ribonucleoprotein_Particle","Post-transcriptional_regulation","Structural_motif","Aromaticity","Amino_acid","Lysine","Helix","Electrostatics","Side_chain","Nucleic_acid","Phosphate","Influenzavirus_A","Self-replication","Virus","RNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Messenger_RNA","RNA_polymerase","Autoantibodies","Lupus_erythematosus","Sj√∂gren's_syndrome","SS-A","SS-B","HnRNP","Ribosome","SnRNP","Signal_recognition_particle","Ribozyme","Telomerase"]}
