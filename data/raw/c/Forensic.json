{"cursor":"34840","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Forensic science' (often shortened to 'forensics') is the application of a\nbroad spectrum of sciences and technologies to investigate and establish facts\nof interest in relation to criminal or civil law. .\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/forensics  The word forensic comes from\nthe Latin forÄnsis, meaning \"of or before the forum.\" In Roman times,\na criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals\nin the forum. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give\nspeeches based on their sides of the story. The individual with the best\nargument and delivery would determine the outcome of the case. This origin is\nthe source of the two modern usages of the word forensic â as a form of legal\nevidence and as a category of public presentation.\n\nIn modern use, the term \"forensics\" in the place of \"forensic science\" can be\nconsidered correct as the term \"forensic\" is effectively a synonym for \"legal\"\nor \"related to courts\". However the term is now so closely associated with the\nscientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the\nword \"forensics\" with \"forensic science\".\n\nIn the United States there are over 12,000 Forensic Science technicians, as of\n2010. U.S. Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Occupational\nEmployment and Wages, May 2011. \"19-4092 Forensic Science Technicians\".\nhttp://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes194092.htm
