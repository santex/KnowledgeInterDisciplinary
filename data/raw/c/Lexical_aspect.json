{"cursor":"4831","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'lexical aspect' or 'aktionsart' (, plural aktionsarten ) of a verb is a\npart of the way in which that verb is structured in relation to time. Any event,\nstate, process, or action which a verb expressesâcollectively, any\neventualityâmay also be said to have the same lexical aspect. Lexical aspect is\ndistinguished from grammatical aspect: lexical aspect is an inherent property of\na (semantic) eventuality, whereas grammatical aspect is a property of a\n(syntactic or morphological) realization. Lexical aspect is invariant, while\ngrammatical aspect can be changed according to the whims of the speaker.\n\nFor example, eat an apple differs from sit in that there is a natural endpoint\nor conclusion to eating an apple. There is a time at which the eating is\nfinished, completed, or all done. By contrast, sitting can merely stop: unless\nwe add more details, it makes no sense to say that someone \"finished\" sitting.\nThis is a distinction of lexical aspect between the two verbs. Verbs that have\nnatural endpoints are called \"telic\" (from Ancient Greek telos, end); those\nwithout are called \"atelic.\"\n","linknr":140,"url":"Lexical_aspect","recorded":1362899131,"links":21,"instances":["grammar"],"pdf":["http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/publications/Lin_PhD_thesis_2004.pdf","http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/publications/Lin_PhD_thesis_2004.pdf"],"categories":["Grammar"],"headings":["Categories","See also","Notes","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["predicate","grammar"]],"members":["predicate"],"related":["Verb","Time","Grammatical_aspect","Telicity","Ancient_Greek","Zeno_Vendler","Continuous_and_progressive_aspects","Bernard_Comrie","Semelfactive","Semelfactive","Predicate_(grammar)","European_Summer_School_in_Logic,_Language_and_Information"]}
