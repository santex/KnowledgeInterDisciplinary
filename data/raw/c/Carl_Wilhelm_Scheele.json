For example,\nScheele discovered oxygen (although Joseph Priestley published his findings\nfirst), and identified molybdenum, tungsten, barium, hydrogen, and chlorine\nbefore Humphry Davy, among others.\n\nScheele was born in Stralsund, Swedish Pomerania. Scheele's father Joachim\nChristian Scheele, was a merchant of a respected German family. At fourteen, he\nwas sent as an apprentice pharmacist in Gothenburg with Martin Andreas\nBauch.

Scheele, from Pharmacistâs Apprentice to Man of Science.\nAmbix 55: 29-49 He retained this position for eight years before becoming\nan apothecary's clerk in MalmÃ¶. Then Scheele worked as a pharmacist in\nStockholm, from 1770-1775 in Uppsala, and later in KÃ¶ping.\n\nScheele preferred speaking German his whole life, and German was commonly spoken\namong Swedish pharmacists.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele","recorded":1362477487,"links":62,"instances":["mineral"],"pdf":[],"categories":["German chemists","Swedish chemists","Swedish pharmacists","Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences","Discoverers of chemical elements","People from Stralsund","People from Swedish Pomerania","German emigrants to Sweden","18th-century German people","18th-century Swedish people","18th-century chemists","1742 births","1786 deaths","People honoured with a mineral name"],"headings":["Existing theories before Scheele","Disproving the theory of phlogiston","New elements and compounds","Death","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele_from_Familj-Journalen1874.png/250px-Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele_from_Familj-Journalen1874.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Priestley.jpg/150px-Priestley.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Pyrolusite_radiating.jpg/146px-Pyrolusite_radiating.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Chlorine-sample.jpg/100px-Chlorine-sample.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele_in_K%C3%B6ping.JPG/200px-Carl_Wilhelm_Scheele_in_K%C3%B6ping.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lime","mineral"]],"members":["lime"],"related":["Stralsund","Swedish_Pomerania","Köping,_Sweden","Sweden","German_people","Swedish_people","Chemistry","Oxygen","Molybdenum","Tungsten","Chlorine","Sweden","Isaac_Asimov","Oxygen","Joseph_Priestley","Molybdenum","Tungsten","Barium","Chlorine","Humphry_Davy","Stralsund","Swedish_Pomerania","Pharmacist","Gothenburg","Malmö","Pharmacist","Stockholm","Uppsala","Köping,_Sweden","Phlogiston","Oxygen","Phlogiston_theory","Air","Chemical_reactions","Potassium_nitrate","Manganese_dioxide","Silver_carbonate","Mercuric_oxide","Joseph_Priestley","Lavoisier","Phlogiston","Antoine_Lavoisier","Joseph_Black","Joseph_Priestley","Oxygen","Chemistry","Oxygen","Torbern_Olof_Bergman","Manganese_dioxide","Mercuric_oxide","Silver_carbonate","Magnesium_nitrate","Nitrate","Barium","Manganese","Molybdenum","Tungsten","Citric_acid","Lactic_acid","Glycerol","Hydrogen_cyanide","Hydrogen_fluoride","Hydrogen_sulfide","Pasteurization","Phosphorus","Matches","Oxygen","Lime_(mineral)","Silica","Iron","Pyrolusite","Johann_Gottlieb_Gahn","Hydrochloric_acid","Humphry_Davy","Chlorine","Heavy_metals","International_Standard_Book_Number","Mercury_poisoning","Lead_poisoning","Fluorine","Scheelite","Scheele's_Green","Pharmacist","Pharmacy","Pneumatic_chemistry","Stralsund","Swedish_Pomerania","Köping,_Sweden","Sweden"]}
