{"cursor":"1767","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, a 'cross-cap' is a two-dimensional surface in 3-space that is\none-sided and the continuous image of a MÃ¶bius strip that intersects itself in\nan interval. In the domain, the inverse image of this interval is a longer\ninterval that the mapping into 3-space \"folds in half\". At the point where the\nlonger interval is folded in half in the image, the nearby configuration is that\nof the Whitney umbrella.\n\nThe interval of self intersection precludes the cross-cap from being\nhomeomorphic to the MÃ¶bius strip, but there are only two points in the image\n(the endpoints of the interval of self-intersection) where the image cannot be\nthat of an immersion. The bounding edge of a cross-cap is a simple closed loop.\nLike certain versions of the MÃ¶bius strip, it may take the form of a\nsymmetrical circle.\n\nA cross-cap that has been closed up by gluing a disc to its boundary is a model\nof the real projective plane P 2 (again with an interval of self-\nintersection, and two points where this model is not an immersion of\nP 2).\n\nTwo cross-caps glued together at their boundaries form a model of the Klein\nbottle, this time with two intervals of self-intersection and four points where\nthis model is not an immersion.\n\nAn important theorem of topology, the classification theorem for surfaces,\nstates that each two-dimensional compact manifold without boundary is\nhomeomorphic to a sphere with some number (possibly 0) of \"handles\" and 0, 1, or\n2 cross-caps.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Cross-cap","recorded":1362477274,"links":12,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Surfaces","Topology"],"headings":["See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interval","mathematics"],["disk","mathematics"]],"members":["disk","interval"],"related":["Mathematics","Möbius_strip","Interval_(mathematics)","Whitney_umbrella","Homeomorphic","Möbius_strip","Circle","Disk_(mathematics)","Real_projective_plane","Klein_bottle","Topology","Classification_theorem_for_surfaces","Two-dimensional","Manifold","Roman_surface"]}
