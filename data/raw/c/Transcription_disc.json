{"cursor":"10918","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'transcription disc' is a special phonograph record intended for, or recorded\nfrom, a radio broadcast. Sometimes called a 'broadcast transcription' or 'radio\ntranscription' or nicknamed a 'platter', the official term was 'electrical\ntranscription', usually abbreviated to 'E.T.' among radio professionals.\n\nTranscription discs are most commonly 16 inches (40 cm) in diameter and recorded\nat 33 1/3 rpm. That format was standard from approximately 1930 to 1960 and\nphysically distinguishes most transcriptions from records intended for home use,\nwhich were rarely more than 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter and until 1948 were\nnearly all recorded at approximately 78 rpm. However, some very early (circa 1928-\n1931) radio programs were on sets of 12 inch (30 cm) or even 10 inch (25 cm)\ndiameter 78 rpm discs, and some later (circa 1960-1985) syndicated radio\nprograms were distributed on 12 inch (30 cm) diameter 33 1/3 rpm microgroove\nvinyl discs visually indistinguishable from ordinary records except by their\nlabel information.\n\nSome unusual records which are not broadcast-related are sometimes mistakenly\ndescribed as \"transcription discs\" because they were recorded on the so-called\nacetate recording blanks used for broadcast transcriptions or share some other\nphysical characteristic with them. Transcription discs should not be confused\nwith the 16 inch diameter, 33 1/3 rpm shellac soundtrack discs used from 1926\ninto the early 1930s to provide the audio for some motion picture sound systems.\nAlso a potential source of confusion are RCA Victor's \"Program Transcription\"\ndiscs, 10 or 12 inch diameter 33 1/3 rpm records pressed in shellac and\n\"Victrolac\" vinyl in the early 1930s. Despite their suggestive name, they were\nnot recorded from broadcasts or intended for broadcast use, but were an early\nand unsuccessful attempt to introduce longer-playing records at the 33 1/3 rpm\nspeed for home use.\n","linknr":145,"url":"Transcription_disc","recorded":1362671880,"links":13,"instances":["am","announcer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radio terminology"],"headings":["Disc types","Notable uses","See also","References and notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Radio_icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["wls","am"],["herbert_morrison","announcer"]],"members":["wls","herbert_morrison"],"related":["Gramophone_record","Rpm","Acetate_disc","Vitaphone","RCA_Victor","Shellac","Vinyl","Acetate_disc","Cellulose_nitrate","Cellulose_acetate","Shellac","Vinyl","Aluminum_disc","Cellulose_nitrate","LP_record","LZ_129_Hindenburg","Chicago","WLS_(AM)","Herbert_Morrison_(announcer)","NBC","World_War_II","Orson_Welles","CBS","Magnetic_tape","NBC_Symphony_Orchestra","Arturo_Toscanini","Gramophone_record","List_of_old-time_radio_programs","List_of_old-time_radio_people","List_of_U.S._radio_programs","Antique_radio","Audio_theater","American_Museum_of_Radio_and_Electricity","Museum_of_Television_&_Radio","Music_radio","Radio","Radio_comedy","Radio_drama","Radio_programming","Soap_opera","When_Radio_Was"]}
