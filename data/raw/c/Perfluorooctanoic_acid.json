One industrial application is as a surfactant in the\n  emulsion polymerization of fluoropolymers. It has been used in the manufacture\n  of such prominent consumer goods as Teflon and Gore-Tex. PFOA has been\n  manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities. It is also formed by\n  the degradation of precursors such as some fluorotelomers.\n\nPFOA persists indefinitely in the environment. It is a toxicant and carcinogen\nin animals. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the\ngeneral US population in the low and sub-parts per billion range, and levels\nare higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations.\nExposure has been associated with increased cholesterol and uric acid levels,\nand recently higher serum levels of PFOA were found to be associated with\nincreased risk of chronic kidney disease in the general United States\npopulation, consistent with earlier animal studies. \"This association was independent of confounders such as age,\nsex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and serum\ncholesterol level.\"\n\nAs a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with DuPont,\nthree epidemiologists are conducting studies on the population surrounding a\nchemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general\npopulation. If PFOA exposure is found to be likely to lead to an increased risk\nof disease, future liabilities for DuPont will be triggered. The first of these\nstudies has reported that workers at this high-PFOA plant are at greatly\nincreased risk of death from mesothelioma, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal\ndisease. Full results from the studies are expected in 2012.\n\nHow general populations are exposed to PFOA is not completely understood. PFOA\nhas been detected in industrial waste, stain resistant carpets, carpet cleaning\nliquids, house dust, microwave popcorn bags, water, food, some cookware and PTFE\nsuch as Teflon.\n","linknr":1453,"url":"Perfluorooctanoic_acid","recorded":1362512056,"links":74,"instances":["chemistry","electrical","chemistry","mass","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.defendingscience.org/case_studies/upload/DuPont_v_Leach_etal_Settlement_2005.pdf","http://www.defendingscience.org/case_studies/upload/1961-memo.pdf","http://www.defendingscience.org/case_studies/upload/1961-memo.pdf","https://www.restorationindustry.org/buyersguide/FlurochemicalsOct06.pdf","https://www.restorationindustry.org/buyersguide/FlurochemicalsOct06.pdf","http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/hazardous/topics/pfcs/pfaapresent.pdf","http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/hazardous/topics/pfcs/pfaapresent.pdf","http://www.sft.no/publikasjoner/2354/ta2354.pdf","http://www.sft.no/publikasjoner/2354/ta2354.pdf","http://www.oehha.ca.gov/Prop65/public_meetings/pdf/PFOACIC%20Slides121206.pdf","http://www.oehha.ca.gov/Prop65/public_meetings/pdf/PFOACIC%20Slides121206.pdf","http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/99/2/366.pdf","http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/99/2/366.pdf","http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/06-2152.pdf","http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/06-2152.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/600r09033/600r09033.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/600r09033/600r09033.pdf","http://www.state.nj.us/dep/watersupply/pfoa_dwguidance.pdf","http://www.state.nj.us/dep/watersupply/pfoa_dwguidance.pdf","http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/hazardous/topics/pfcworkshop0507/pfcs_cdcatsdr.pdf","http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/hazardous/topics/pfcworkshop0507/pfcs_cdcatsdr.pdf","http://www.sft.no/publikasjoner/2354/ta2354.pdf","http://www.sft.no/publikasjoner/2354/ta2354.pdf","http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/uba-info-presse-e/hintergrund/pft-in-drinking-water.pdf","http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/uba-info-presse-e/hintergrund/pft-in-drinking-water.pdf","http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0901165/0901165.pdf","http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0901165/0901165.pdf","http://www.c8sciencepanel.org/pdfs/Status_Report_C8_and_puberty_27Sept2010.pdf","http://www.c8sciencepanel.org/pdfs/Status_Report_C8_and_puberty_27Sept2010.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09353.pdf","http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09353.pdf","http://www.c8sciencepanel.org/pdfs/Status_Report_C8_and_Pregnancy_Outcomes_March2009.pdf","http://www.c8sciencepanel.org/pdfs/Status_Report_C8_and_Pregnancy_Outcomes_March2009.pdf","http://www.wvsd.uscourts.gov/district/opinions/pdf/RhodesvDuPontMemOp.pdf","http://www.wvsd.uscourts.gov/district/opinions/pdf/606cv00530ORDsummj.pdf","http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/A3C83648E77252828525717F004B9099/$File/sab_06_006.pdf","http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/A3C83648E77252828525717F004B9099/$File/sab_06_006.pdf","http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2003/pdf/03-9418.pdf","http://www.kemi.se/upload/Trycksaker/Pdf/Rapporter/Report7_06.pdf","http://assets.panda.org/downloads/fact_sheet___pfcs_food.pdf"],"categories":["Carboxylic
