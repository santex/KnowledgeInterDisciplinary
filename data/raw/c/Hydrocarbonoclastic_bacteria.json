{"cursor":"17995","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Interest in the 'microbial biodegradation' of pollutants has intensified in\nrecent years as humanity strives to find sustainable ways to clean up\ncontaminated environments.\nThese bioremediation and biotransformation methods endeavour to harness the\nastonishing, naturally occurring ability of microbial xenobiotic metabolism to\ndegrade, transform or accumulate a huge range of compounds including\nhydrocarbons (e.g. oil), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs), heterocyclic compounds (such as pyridine or quinoline),\npharmaceutical substances, radionuclides and metals. Major methodological\nbreakthroughs in recent years have enabled detailed genomic, metagenomic,\nproteomic, bioinformatic and other high-throughput analyses of environmentally\nrelevant microorganisms providing unprecedented insights into key biodegradative\npathways and the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environmental\nconditions.\n\nThe elimination of a wide range of pollutants and wastes from the environment is\nan absolute requirement to promote a sustainable development of our society with\nlow environmental impact. Biological processes play a major role in the removal\nof contaminants and they take advantage of the astonishing catabolic versatility\nof microorganisms to degrade or convert such compounds. New methodological\nbreakthroughs in sequencing, genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and imaging\nare producing vast amounts of information. In the field of Environmental\nmicrobiology, genome-based global studies open a new era providing unprecedented\nin silico views of metabolic and regulatory networks, as well as clues to the\nevolution of degradation pathways and to the molecular adaptation strategies to\nchanging environmental conditions. Functional genomic and metagenomic approaches\nare increasing our understanding of the relative importance of different\npathways and regulatory networks to carbon flux in particular environments and\nfor particular compounds and they will certainly accelerate the development of\nbioremediation technologies and biotransformation processes.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Hydrocarbonoclastic_bacteria","recorded":1362511502,"links":11,"instances":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf","http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf"],"categories":["Bioremediation","Biotechnology","Environmental microbiology","Environmental soil science","Soil contamination","Biodegradation","Environmental science"],"headings":["Aerobic biodegradation of pollutants","Anaerobic biodegradation of pollutants","Bioavailability, chemotaxis, and transport of pollutants","Oil biodegradation","Cholesterol biodegradation","Analysis of waste biotreatment","Metabolic engineering and biocatalytic applications","Fungal biodegradation","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["substrate","chemistry"],["fermentation","biochemistry"]],"members":["substrate","fermentation"],"related":["Pollutant","Bioremediation","Biotransformation","Xenobiotic_metabolism","Hydrocarbon","Polychlorinated_biphenyls","Polyaromatic_hydrocarbons","Heterocyclic_compounds","Pyridine","Quinoline","Radionuclide","Microorganism","Natural_environment","Contaminant","Sequencing","Genomics","Proteomics","Bioinformatics","Microbiology","Genome","Carbon_flux","Pollutant","Aromatic_compounds","Catabolism","Organic_compound","Genome","Metabolic_pathway","Pseudomonad","Xenobiotic","Homologous_enzymes","Anaerobic_organism","Microbial","Pollutant","Hydrocarbon","Bacteria","Genomics","Environmental_microbiology","Genome","Toluene","Ethylbenzene","Substrate_(chemistry)","Genome_sequence","Gene_cluster","Paralog","Enzyme","Halorespiration","Bromoxynil","Bioavailability","Microorganism","Biodegradation","Kaolinite","2-picoline","Chemotaxis","Petroleum","Pollution","Heterocyclic_compounds","Anthropogenic","Bioreactors","Genome","Oxygenase","Metagenomic","DNA_sequence","Mutagenesis","Biodegradation","Bioconversion","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Biotechnology","Mould","Biodegradation","Bioremediation","Biotransformation","Bioavailability","Chemotaxis","Microbiology","Environmental_microbiology","Industrial_microbiology"]}
