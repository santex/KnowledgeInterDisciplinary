Interference occurs in\nlearning when there is an interaction between the new material and transfer\neffects of past learned behavior, memories or thoughts that have a negative\ninfluence in comprehending the new material.\nBringing to memory old knowledge has the effect of impairing both the speed of\nlearning and memory performance. There are three main kinds of interference:\n*proactive interference *retroactive interference *latent interference The main\nassumption of interference theory is that the stored memory is intact but unable\nto be retrieved due to competition created by newly acquired information.\n","linknr":579,"url":"Interference_theory","recorded":1362567208,"links":23,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Memory","Memory processes"],"headings":["History","Proactive interference","Retroactive interference","Output interference","Similar theories","Neurobiology","Application","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Prefrontal_cortex.png/220px-Prefrontal_cortex.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus.png/220px-Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Amygdala.gif/220px-Amygdala.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/MRI_brain.jpg/220px-MRI_brain.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Caudate_nucleus.png/220px-Caudate_nucleus.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["crosstalk","biology"]],"members":["crosstalk"],"related":["Memory","Learning","Bergström","Stroop_task","Georg_Elias_Müller","Pilzeker","Müller","Benton_J._Underwood","James_J._Jenkins","Decay_theory","Working_memory","Delos_Wickens","FMRI","Ventrolateral","Prefrontal_cortex","Anterior","Working_memory","Language_comprehension","Spontaneous_recovery","Spontaneous_Recovery","Prefrontal_cortex","Magnetoencephalography","Working_memory","Frontal_cortex","Working_memory","Short_term_memory","Word_Superiority_Effect","Spreading_activation","Henry_L._Roediger_III","Recency_effect","Hippocampus","Amygdala","Short-term_memory","Long-term_memory","Free_recall","Decay_theory","Decay_theory","Decay_theory","Forgetting","McMaster_University","Crosstalk_(biology)","Simon_task","Magnetic_resonance_image","Anterior_cingulate","Supplementary_motor_cortex","Visual_association_cortex","Inferior_temporal_cortex","Parietal_cortex","Frontal_cortex","Prefrontal_cortex","Caudate_nuclei","Information_processing","Multimedia_learning","Neuroimaging","Working_Memory","Memory_inhibition"]}
