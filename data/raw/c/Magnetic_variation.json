{"cursor":"17313","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Magnetic declination' is the angle between compass north (the direction the\nnorth end of a compass needle points) and true north (the direction along the\nearth's surface towards the geographic North\nPole http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_north ). The declination is\npositive when the magnetic north is east of true north. The term 'magnetic\nvariation' is a synonym, and is more often used in navigation. '[[Isogon]]ic'\nlines are where the declination has the same value, and the lines where the\ndeclination is zero are called 'agonic lines'.\n\nSomewhat more formally, Bowditch defines variation as âthe angle between the\nmagnetic and geographic meridians at any place, expressed in degrees and minutes\neast or west to indicate the direction of magnetic north from true north. The\nangle between magnetic and grid meridians is called grid magnetic angle, grid\nvariation, or grivation. Called magnetic variation when a distinction is needed\nto prevent possible ambiguity. Also called magnetic declination.â [http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/glossary/gloss-\nuvwxyz.pdf]\n","linknr":237,"url":"Magnetic_variation","recorded":1362666939,"links":60,"instances":["navigation","navigation"],"pdf":["http://www.irbs.com/bowditch/pdf/glossary/gloss-uvwxyz.pdf"],"categories":["Orientation","Geomagnetism","Angle"],"headings":["Change of declination in time and space","Stating the declination","Discovering declination","Learning the declination for an area","Using the declination","Navigation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Magnetic_declination.svg/220px-Magnetic_declination.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/World_Magnetic_Declination_2010.pdf/page1-350px-World_Magnetic_Declination_2010.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/IsraelCVFRmag.jpg/100px-IsraelCVFRmag.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Mv-world.jpg/300px-Mv-world.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Boussole.jpg/205px-Boussole.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Compensating_magnetic_declination.svg/300px-Compensating_magnetic_declination.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Earth_Magnetic_Field_Declination_from_1590_to_1990.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Deklinationsnadel_hg.jpg/220px-Deklinationsnadel_hg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Yacht_foresail.svg/24px-Yacht_foresail.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bearing","navigation"],["bearing","navigation"],["bearing","navigation"],["bearing","navigation"],["course","navigation"]],"members":["course","bearing"],"related":["Magnetic_North_Pole","Compass","True_north","Bowditch's_American_Practical_Navigator","True_north","North_pole","United_States","Iron","Ore","Magnetite","Secular_phenomena","Ivujivik","Metes_and_bounds","Topographic_map","U.S._Geological_Survey","Angular_mil","Isogon","Aeronautical_chart","Nautical_chart","Celestial_pole","Instrument","Polaris","Plumb-bob","Empirical_model","National_Geophysical_Data_Center","National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration","United_States","Bezel","Magnetic_deviation","Bearing_(navigation)","Bearing_(navigation)","Bearing_(navigation)","Bearing_(navigation)","Magnetic_deviation","Air_navigation","VHF_omnidirectional_range","Runway","Azimuth","Course_(navigation)","Northern_Domestic_Airspace","GPS","Geomagnetism","L-shell","Magnetic_deviation","Magnetic_inclination","North_Magnetic_Pole","Pole_star","Shen_Kuo","Voyages_of_Christopher_Columbus"]}
