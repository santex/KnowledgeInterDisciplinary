Its equivalent body for organized sports at\ncolleges in Canada is The Canadian Colleges Athletic Association (or CCAA). Some\ninstitutions are members of both bodies for different sports.\n\nThe Canadian Interuniversity Sport's name in French is 'Sport interuniversitaire\ncanadien' (SIC).\n\nThe original Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union (CIAU) Central was founded\nin 1906 and existed until 1955, composed only of universities from Ontario and\nQuebec. With the collapse of the CIAU Central in the mid-1950s, calls for a new,\nnational governing body for university sport accelerated. Once the Royal\nMilitary College of Canada became a degree granting institution, Major W.J.\n(Danny) McLeod, Athletic Director at the RMC directed the establishment of the\nCanadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU) in 1961. http://english.cis-\nsic.ca/information/about_cis/cishistory History of CIS Major McLeod ran\nthe CIAU from his office at RMC as the first CIAU Secretary-Treasurer. In the\n1960s the CIAU functioned as a voluntary, autonomous, educational sport\norganization which represented by the various universities from coast to coast.\nIn 1978, the CIAU changed its name to the 'Canadian Interuniversity Athletics\nUnion'. It changed its name to Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) in June 2001\ndue to growing misconceptions about the name of the organization since the term\n\"athletic\" was associated with track and field and \"union\" with labour\nmovements.\n\nThe 54th member of the CIS is Mount Royal University.\n","linknr":954,"url":"Canadian_Interuniversity_Sport","recorded":1362889740,"links":39,"instances":["new_brunswick_tommies","district_municipality","montreal","sport","halifax","new_brunswick"],"pdf":["http://english.cis-sic.ca/information/members_info/pdfs/pdf_research_and_stats/SchoolSummary_-_english_08-09.pdf","http://english.cis-sic.ca/sports/5-Year_Schedule_2011_to_2016.pdf","http://www.utoronto.ca/__shared/assets/UofT_2010_FactsFiguresReport4316.pdf"],"categories":["Canadian
