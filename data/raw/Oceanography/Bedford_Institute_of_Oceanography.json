The Bedford Institute of Oceanography is the\nlargest ocean research station in Canada. Established in 1962 as Canada's first,\nand currently largest, federal centre for oceanographic research, BIO derives\nits name from the Bedford Basin, an inland bay comprising the northern part of\nHalifax Harbour, upon which it is located.\n\nSpread out over 40 acres (160,000 mÂ²) of a former Royal Canadian Navy (RCN)\nproperty near Shannon Park in Dartmouth, BIO consists of a series of\ninterconnected buildings housing research labs and offices, as well as docks for\nCanadian Coast Guard and RCN research vessels.\n\nAs the federal government seeks to concentrate its operations in the Halifax\nRegional Municipality, BIO is being considered for additional office buildings\nto house other non-oceanographic and non-research organizations and their\nemployees. As such, new buildings have been built for the Canadian Coast Guard\nas well as Environment Canada.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Bedford_Institute_of_Oceanography","recorded":1362501694,"links":15,"instances":["canada","canada","canada","canada"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Canadian federal government buildings","Buildings and structures in the Halifax Regional Municipality","Research institutes in Canada","Oceanographic institutions","Biological research institutes","Fisheries and aquaculture research institutes","1962 establishments","Fisheries and Oceans Canada"],"headings":["Current operations","Federal departments and agencies","Facilities","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["department_of_fisheries_and_oceans","canada"],["department_of_natural_resources","canada"],["department_of_the_environment","canada"],["department_of_national_defence","canada"]],"members":["department_of_fisheries_and_oceans","department_of_national_defence","department_of_natural_resources","department_of_the_environment"],"related":["Canada","Oceanography","Dartmouth,_Nova_Scotia","Halifax_Regional_Municipality","Nova_Scotia","Bedford_Basin","Acre","Royal_Canadian_Navy","Shannon_Park,_Nova_Scotia","Dartmouth,_Nova_Scotia","Canadian_Coast_Guard","Research","Ocean","Navigation","Chart","Georges_Bank","Canadian_Arctic","Department_of_Fisheries_and_Oceans_(Canada)","Canadian_Hydrographic_Service","Department_of_Natural_Resources_(Canada)","Geological_Survey_of_Canada","Department_of_the_Environment_(Canada)","Department_of_National_Defence_(Canada)","North_Atlantic_Lobster","Snow_Crabs","Rock_Crabs","Clams","Mackerel","Sturgeon","Leatherback_Sea_Turtle","Atlantic_Whitefish","Northern_Right_Whale","Sharks","Lake_Whitefish","Largemouth_Bass","Brook_Trout","Atlantic_Wolffish","Atlantic_Pickerel","Sable_Island","The_Gulley"]}
