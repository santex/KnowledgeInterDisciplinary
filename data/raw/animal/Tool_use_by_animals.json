Originally thought to be a skill only possessed by\nhumans, tool use often requires a more sophisticated level of intelligence.\nPrimates have been observed exploiting sticks and stones to accomplish tasks.\nNumerous bird species have also been noted as capable of using tools. The\nbehaviour has also been observed in dolphins, elephants, otters, birds and\noctopuses. Tools may be used by animals for construction. Very rarely, non-human animals have been observed\nbuilding their own tools, e.g., primates removing leaves and twigs from a branch\nor sharpening a stick to use as a weapon.
