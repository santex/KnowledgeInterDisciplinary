Although the\nterm \"symbol\" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized,\nand at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are\nbeing used to express that idea; in the formal languages studied in mathematics\nand logic, the term \"symbol\" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to\nbe a token instance of the symbol. In logic, symbols build literal utility to\nillustrate ideas.\n\nSymbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance\nthere are logical constants which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as\na form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). Symbols of a formal\nlanguage must be capable of being specified without any reference to any\ninterpretation of them.\n\nA symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if it is\nconsistent with the formation rules of the language.\n\nIn a formal system a symbol may be used as a token in formal operations.
