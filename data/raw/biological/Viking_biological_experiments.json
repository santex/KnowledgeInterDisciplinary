These were the\nfirst Mars landers to carry out experiments to look for biosignatures of life on\nMars. The landers used a robotic arm to put soil samples into sealed test\ncontainers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were\ncarried out at two places on Mars' surface, Viking 1 near the equator and Viking\n2 further north. {{Cite book\n | first = Paul last = Chambers title = Life on Mars; The Complete Story place =\n | London publisher = Blandford year = 1999 isbn = 0-7137-2747-0\n}}\n","linknr":537,"url":"Viking_biological_experiments","recorded":1362506438,"links":22,"instances":["spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft","spacecraft","planet"],"pdf":["http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2007/01794/EGU2007-J-01794.pdf","http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2007/01794/EGU2007-J-01794.pdf","http://autonomy.caltech.edu/publications/journals/BOLD_SPIE_submitted_final.pdf","http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/01/23/NAC_Science_Meeting_ReportOctober_31-November_1_2011-finalTAGGED.pdf","http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2012/01/23/NAC_Science_Meeting_ReportOctober_31-November_1_2011-finalTAGGED.pdf","http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/ancham/79/i19/pdf/1007feature_viking.pdf"],"categories":["Astrobiology","Viking program"],"headings":["The experiments","Scientific conclusions","Controversy","Critiques","Future missions","See also","References","External links","Notes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d4/Viking_Biological_package.I.png/350px-Viking_Biological_package.I.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["life_on_mars","planet"],["phoenix","spacecraft"],["phoenix","spacecraft"],["life_on_mars","planet"],["life_on_mars","planet"],["red_dragon","spacecraft"],["lander","spacecraft"],["dragon","spacecraft"],["life_on_mars","planet"],["life_on_mars","planet"]],"members":["dragon","lander","phoenix","red_dragon","life_on_mars"],"related":["Biological","Experiment","Mars","Biosignature","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Viking_1","Viking_2","Gas_chromatograph","Mass_spectrometer","Molecular_weight","Natural_organic_matter","Apollo_program","Perchlorate","Helium","Gas_chromatograph","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Hydrogen","Methane","Exobiologist","Miller-Urey","Metabolism","Complexity_analysis","Viking_program","Norman_Horowitz","Atmosphere_of_Mars","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_dioxide","Carbon-14","Radioactive","Isotope","Photosynthesis","Biomass","Carbon_fixation","Cyanobacteria","Metabolism","Ultraviolet","Ozone_layer","Oxidant","Carbon_dioxide","Phoenix_(spacecraft)","Perchlorate","Chloromethane","Dichloromethane","Perchlorate","Gilbert_Levin","Hydrogen_peroxide","Titanium_dioxide","Gilbert_Levin","Biosignature","ExoMars","Mars_Science_Laboratory","Taxonomy","Metabolism","James_Lovelock","ExoMars_Trace_Gas_Orbiter","Airbag","Mars_Pathfinder","Mars_Exploration_Rover","Phoenix_(spacecraft)","Hydrazine","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Mars_Science_Laboratory","Curiosity_rover","Climate_of_Mars","Geology_of_Mars","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Water_on_Mars","Planetary_habitability","Mars_Trace_Gas_Mission","ExoMars","Biological_Oxidant_and_Life_Detection","Red_Dragon_(spacecraft)","Lander_(spacecraft)","SpaceX","Falcon_Heavy","Dragon_(spacecraft)","Atmospheric_entry","Martian_atmosphere","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Biosignature","Discovery_Program","Astrobiology","Biological_Oxidant_and_Life_Detection","Biosignature","ExoMars","Exploration_of_Mars","Life_on_Mars_(planet)","Viking_program","Viking_1","Viking_2"]}
