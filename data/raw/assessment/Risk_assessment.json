{"cursor":"24191","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Risk assessment' is the determination of quantitative or qualitative value of\nrisk related to a concrete situation and a recognized threat (also called\nhazard). Quantitative risk assessment requires calculations of two components of\nrisk (R):, the magnitude of the potential loss (L), and the probability (p) that\nthe loss will occur. In all types of engineering of complex systems\nsophisticated risk assessments are often made within Safety engineering and\nReliability engineering when it concerns threats to life, environment or machine\nfunctioning. The nuclear, aerospace, oil, rail and military industries have a\nlong history of dealing with risk assessment. Also, medical, hospital, and food\nindustries control risks and perform risk assessments on a continual basis.\nMethods for assessment of risk may differ between industries and whether it\npertains to general financial decisions or environmental, ecological, or public\nhealth risk assessment.\n","linknr":280,"url":"Risk_assessment","recorded":1362580364,"links":31,"instances":["risk"],"pdf":["http://www.pmhut.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/risk_management.pdf"],"categories":["Evaluation","Impact assessment","Probability assessment","Risk factors","Risk management","Hazard analysis","Technology assessment","Safety engineering","Reliability engineering"],"headings":["Explanation","Risk assessment in public health","Risk assessment in auditing","Risk assessment and human health","Risk assessment in information security","Risk assessment in project management","Risk assessment for megaprojects","Quantitative risk assessment","Risk assessment in software evolution","Criticisms of quantitative risk assessment","Risk assessment in shipping industry","See also","References","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/d/0ed2f4c9c6578bed0d0826fcc106b451.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/e/f4e6383ab4ea59bc164dc3fb01713220.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d2/Risk.jpg/300px-Risk.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/b/e/8be1cea723ba08d3dd51c2465c72a99e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Risk_Based_Sampling_Nomogram_%283yr%29.png/200px-Risk_Based_Sampling_Nomogram_%283yr%29.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hazard","risk"]],"members":["hazard"],"related":["Quantitative_property","Qualitative_data","Threat","Risk","Safety_engineering","Reliability_engineering","Public_health","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Toxicology","Epidemiology","Mouse","Rat","Genetics","No_effect_concentration","Exposure_assessment","Mythical_number","Incineration","Inherent_risk","Control_risk","Detection_risk","National_Library_of_Medicine","TOXMAP","Superfund","Toxics_Release_Inventory","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","IT_risk","Project_management","Megaprojects","Single_loss_expectancy","Annualized_Rate_of_Occurrence","Annualized_Loss_Expectancy","Barry_Commoner","Brian_Wynne","Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb","Benefit_risk","Control_self-assessment","Cost_risk","Digital_Continuity","Edwards_v._National_Coal_Board","Extreme_risk","Flood_risk_assessment","Form_696","Green_Globe","HACCP","Hazard_(risk)","Hazard_Identification","Health_Impact_Assessment","Information_assurance","List_of_auditing_topics","ISO_28000","ISO_31000","ISSOW","Network_Theory_in_Risk_Assessment","Optimism_bias","PIMEX","Probabilistic_risk_assessment","Probit_model","Reference_class_forecasting","Risk","Risk_aversion","Risk_management","Risk_management_tools","RiskAoA","Security_risk","Strategic_misrepresentation","Barry_Commoner"]}
