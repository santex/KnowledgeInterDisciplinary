{"cursor":"1367","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer networking, 'upstream server' refers to a server that provides\nservice to another server. In other words, upstream server is a server that is\nlocated higher in the hierarchy of servers. The highest server in the hierarchy\nis sometimes called the 'origin server'. The inverse term, 'downstream server',\nis rarely used.\n\nThe terms are exclusively used in contexts where requests and responses move in\nopposite ways. It is not used when discussing hierarchical routing or\nhierarchical network topologies, as packets can be transferred both ways.\n\nFor example, in the domain name system, a name server in a company's local area\nnetwork often forwards requests to the internet service provider's (ISP's) name\nservers, instead of resolving the domain name directly — it can be said\nthat the ISP's name servers are 'upstream' to the local server. Conversely, the\nISP's servers typically resolve domain names from the domain's authoritative\n'origin servers' — the authoritative servers are said to be 'upstream' to\nthe ISP's servers. Note that the hierarchy of resolvers is unrelated to the\nactual domain name hierarchy.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Upstream_server","recorded":1362676192,"links":15,"instances":["computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Network management"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Crystal_Clear_app_network.png/35px-Crystal_Clear_app_network.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["server","computing"]],"members":["server"],"related":["Computer_networking","Server_(computing)","Hierarchy","Hierarchical_routing","Domain_name_system","Name_server","Local_area_network","Internet_service_provider","Domain_name"]}
