{"cursor":"5274","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In linguistics, an 'absolute construction' is a grammatical construction\nstanding apart from a normal or usual syntactical relation with other words or\nsentence elements. It can be a non-finite clause that is subordinate in form and\nmodifies an entire sentence, an adjective or possessive pronoun standing alone\nwithout a modified substantive, or a transitive verb when its object is implied\nbut not stated. [http://www.m-\nw.com/dictionary/absolute] American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth\nEdition The term absolute\nderives from Latin absolÅ«tum, meaning \"loosened from\" or \"separated\".\n\nBecause the non-finite clause, called the 'absolute clause' (or simply the\n'absolute'), is not semantically attached to any single element in the sentence,\nit is easily confused with a dangling participle. The\ndifference is that the participial phrase of a dangling participle is intended\nto modify a particular noun, but is instead erroneously attached to a different\nnoun, whereas a participial phrase serving as an absolute clause is not intended\nto modify any noun at all.\n","linknr":139,"url":"Absolute_construction","recorded":1362554347,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_PetitionerAmCu3LinguisticsEnglishProfsnew.pdf","http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_PetitionerAmCu3LinguisticsEnglishProfsnew.pdf"],"categories":["Grammar","Syntax"],"headings":["English","Latin","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Grammatical_construction","Non-finite_clause","Dependent_clause","Substantive","Transitive_verb","Dangling_participle","Participial_phrase","Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Ablative_case","Ablative_absolute","Ablative_absolute","Accusative_absolute","Genitive_absolute","Nominative_absolute"]}
