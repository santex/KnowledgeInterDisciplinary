It is exemplified by Taylor's\nA Study of Archeology (1948, American Anthropological Association, Memoir 69).\n\nTaylor saw archaeology as an integrated discipline, combining the study of diet,\nsettlement patterns, tools and other elements to provide a holistic view of the\npast. This approach, along with Taylor's open and specific criticism of leading\narchaeologists of his day, caused dismay amongst many archaeologists at the\ntime, but Taylor's approach is now a standard practice in the discipline.\n\nTaylor was one of the first to criticize the descriptive, historical approaches\nto archaeology that dominated the discipline. According to Patty Jo Watson,\nTaylor's purpose \"was not to generate ill will but rather to stimulate\nexamination ... of aims, goals and purposes by American archaeologists\" (1983,\nForeword to the 1983 edition of A Study of Archeology. Center for Archaeological\nInvestigations, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale).\n","linknr":93,"url":"Conjunctive_archaeology","recorded":1362480859,"links":16,"instances":["nutrition","archaeologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Archaeological theory","Methods and principles in archaeology"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg/15px-Venus_von_Willendorf_01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["walter_taylor","archaeologist"],["diet","nutrition"]],"members":["diet","walter_taylor"],"related":["Walter_Taylor_(archaeologist)","Archaeology","Anthropology","Diet_(nutrition)","Holism","Culture_history"]}
