{"cursor":"3647","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'term paper' is a research paper written by students over an academic term,\naccounting for a large part of a grade. Term papers are generally intended to\ndescribe an event, a concept, or argue a point. A term paper is a written\noriginal work discussing a topic in detail, usually several typed pages in\nlength and is often due at the end of a semester. There is much overlap between\nthe terms \"research paper\" and \"term paper\". The phrase \"term paper\" was\noriginally used to describe a paper (usually a research based paper) that was\ndue at the end of the \"term\" - either a semester or quarter, depending on which\nunit of measure a school used. However, the term has fallen out of favor. Common\nusage has \"term paper\" and \"research paper\" as interchangeable, but this is not\ncompletely accurate. Not all term papers involve academic research, and not all\nresearch papers are term papers.\n\nTerm papers date back to the beginning of the 19th century when print could be\nreproduced cheaply and written texts of all types (reports, memoranda,\nspecifications, and scholarly articles) could be easily produced and\ndisseminated. During the years from 1870 to 1900, Moulton and Holmes (2003)\nwrite that \"American education was transformed as writing became a method of\ndiscourse and research the hallmark of learning.\" Moulton, Margaret R. and\nHolmes, Vicki L (2003) \"The Research Paper: A Historical Perspective,\" Teaching\nEnglish in the Two Year College 30(4) p.366 Russell (1991) writes that in\nthe 1910s, \"the research paper began to harden into its familiar form\" adding\nthat plagiarism and the sale of research papers both became a problem during\nthis time. Russell, David R. Writing in the Academic Disciplines, 1870-1990:\nA Curricular History. Southern Illinois University, 1991. p.87-8\n\nIn the present day an entire industry has sprung up to provide plagiarized, pre-\nwritten, or custom written term papers to students of varying levels of\neducation. There are many websites that sell term papers of all levels of\nquality and writing proficiency, but are often claimed by academic institutions\nas seriously undermining the academic integrity of the\nstudent. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6680457.stm Use\nof such papers is frowned upon by educators and administrators, and submission\nof these works is considered plagiarism, and grounds for disciplinary action on\nthe basis of academic dishonesty. These papers are in some rare cases used as a\n\"model\" for a student to use as a starting point in their research, but this is\nalso considered ethically questionable and is usually a pretext for plagiarism.\n","linknr":98,"url":"Term_paper","recorded":1363123511,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Student","/wiki/Academic_term","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Plagiarism","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Academic_integrity","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Academic_dishonesty","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Final_examination","/wiki/Scholarly_paper#Categories_of_papers","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=edit&section=2","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","#cite_ref-3","http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6680457.stm","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=edit&section=3","http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/termpapr.htm","http://library.humboldt.edu/ic/general_competency/kuhlthau.html","/wiki/Carol_Kuhlthau","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&oldid=541518955","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Educational_assessment_and_evaluation","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_April_2009","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Term+paper&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Term+paper","/wiki/Term_paper","/wiki/Talk:Term_paper","#","/wiki/Term_paper","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Term_paper","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Term_paper","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&oldid=541518955","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Term_paper&id=541518955","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Term+paper","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Term+paper&oldid=541518955&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Term_paper&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminararbeit","//ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kertas_penggal","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_(werkstuk)","//sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminarski_rad","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Term
