{"cursor":"24559","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Paper recycling' is the process of turning waste paper into new paper products.\nThere are three categories of paper that can be used as feedstocks for making\nrecycled paper: mill broke, pre-consumer waste, and post-consumer waste. Mill broke is paper trimmings and other paper scrap from\nthe manufacture of paper, and is recycled internally in a paper mill. Pre-\nconsumer waste is material which left the paper mill but was discarded before it\nwas ready for consumer use. Post-consumer waste is material discarded after\nconsumer use, such as old corrugated containers (OCC), old magazines, old\nnewspapers (ONP), office paper, old telephone directories, and residential mixed\npaper (RMP). Debunking the Myths . . Paper suitable for recycling is\ncalled \"scrap paper\", often used to produce molded pulp packaging. The\nindustrial process of removing printing ink from paperfibers of recycled paper\nto make deinked pulp is called deinking, an invention of the German jurist\nJustus Claproth.\n","linknr":487,"url":"Recycled_paper","recorded":1362512366,"links":48,"instances":["papermaking"],"pdf":["http://www.tappi.org/paperu/all_about_paper/earth_answers/earthanswers_recycle.pdf","http://www.tappi.org/paperu/all_about_paper/earth_answers/earthanswers_recycle.pdf","http://www.greenpressinitiative.org/documents/recycledfiberfactsheet-EPN.pdf","http://www.greenpressinitiative.org/documents/recycledfiberfactsheet-EPN.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070912025805/http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/pubs/ex-sum05.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/pubs/ex-sum05.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070912025805/http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/pubs/ex-sum05.pdf","http://www.intergraf.eu/Content/ContentFolders/PressReleases/2008-09_ERPC_AnnualReport_2007.pdf","http://www.intergraf.eu/Content/ContentFolders/PressReleases/2008-09_ERPC_AnnualReport_2007.pdf"],"categories":["Paper recycling|","Water conservation"],"headings":["Paper recycling process","Rationale for recycling","Recycling facts and figures","Paper recycling by region","See also","References","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Paper_recycling_in_Ponte_a_Serraglio.JPG/250px-Paper_recycling_in_Ponte_a_Serraglio.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ambox_outdated_content.svg/42px-Ambox_outdated_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Ambox_outdated_content.svg/42px-Ambox_outdated_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stickies","papermaking"]],"members":["stickies"],"related":["Post-consumer_waste","Paper_mill","Telephone_directory","Molded_pulp","Printing_ink","Deinked_pulp","Deinking","Justus_Claproth","Newsprint","Kraft_process","Lignin","Reforestation","Programme_for_the_Endorsement_of_Forest_Certification","Forest_Stewardship_Council","Energy_Information_Administration","Bureau_of_International_Recycling","Kraft_process","Tonne","Short_ton","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Pulp_mill","Bleaching_of_wood_pulp","Hydrogen_peroxide","Sodium_hydrosulfite","Recycling_in_America","Municipal_solid_waste","Landfill","Materials_recovery_facilities","Recycling","Newsprint","The_PRC","Spruce","Fir_tree","Balsam_fir","Pine","Newsprint","Baler","Banana_paper","Deinked_pulp","Enviroboard","Molded_pulp","Paper_shredder","Stickies_(papermaking)","Tree-free_paper","Post_Office_Box_Lobby_Recycling_program"]}
