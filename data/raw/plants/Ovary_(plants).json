{"cursor":"5186","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (=ovary+style+stigma), ovules, and petals]] In the flowering plants, an 'ovary'\n is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower or gynoecium.\n Specifically, it is the part of the pistil which holds the ovule(s) and is\n located above or below or at the point of connection with the base of the\n petals and sepals. The pistil may be made up of one carpel or of several fused\n carpels, and therefore the ovary can contain part of one carpel or parts of\n several fused carpels. In this picture of a zucchini the petals and sepals are\n above the ovary and such a flower is said to have an inferior ovary; also\n referred to as epigynous. Above the ovary is the style and the stigma, which is\n where the pollen lands and germinates to grow down through the style to the\n ovary, and, for each individual pollen grain, to grow into one individual\n ovule. Some wind pollinated flowers have much reduced and modified ovaries.\n","linknr":163,"url":"Ovary_(plants)","recorded":1362567662,"links":40,"instances":["botany"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Organs","Plant morphology"],"headings":["Fruits","Parts of the ovary","Classification based on position","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Femalesquash3747.JPG/300px-Femalesquash3747.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Ovary_position.svg/300px-Ovary_position.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["style","botany"]],"members":["style"],"related":["Flowering_plant","Gynoecium","Pistil","Ovule","Petals","Sepals","Carpel","Zucchini","Style_(botany)","Pollen","Pollen_grain","Fruit","Seed","Perianth","Androecium","Berry","Drupe","Cucurbitaceae","Pome","Orchids","Asteraceae","Cypsela","Lythraceae","Crape_Myrtle","Fruit_anatomy"]}
