{"cursor":"4666","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'German strongholds during World War II' ( \"fortresses\") were the selected towns\nand cities so designated by Adolf Hitler to resist the Allied offensives where\nthe defenders were ordered to defend them at all costs. The doctrine of these\nstrongholds evolved towards the end of World War II, when the German leadership\nhad not yet accepted defeat, but had begun to realize that drastic measures were\nrequired to forestall inevitable offensives on the Reich. The first such\nstronghold became Stalingrad (Battle of Stalingrad).\n\nLater on the Eastern Front, Warsaw, Budapest, Kolberg, KÃ¶nigsberg, KÃ¼strin,\nDanzig and Breslau were some of the large cities selected as strongholds whilst\non the Western Front locations included the British island of Alderney.\n\nThe fate of the strongholds varied. Stalingrad, the first of the \"fortresses\" to\nfall is seen as a crucial turning point in the war, and one of the key battles\nwhich lead to German defeat. In several cases (Breslau and Alderney, for\nexample) the fortresses were bypassed by the attackers and did not actually fall\nuntil long after they had been neutralised (though fighting in Breslau was\nsustained).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| width=\"13%\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | 'Location' width=\"15%\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" |\n| 'Commandant' width=\"20%\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | 'Besiegers' width=\"10%\"\n| bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | 'Date declared' width=\"12%\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | 'Date\n| surrendered' width=\"30%\" bgcolor=\"#FFEBAD\" | 'Information' -\n|Alderney\n|\n|Royal Navy\n|\n|16 May 1945\n|Contained until after general German surrender\n|-\n|Boulogne |Ferdinand Heim |reinforced Canadian 3rd Division\n|\n|22 September 1944\n|Captured after five day operation.
