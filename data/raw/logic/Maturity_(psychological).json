This response is generally learned rather than instinctive,\nand is not determined by one's age. Maturity also encompasses being aware of the\ncorrect time and place to behave and knowing when to act appropriately,\naccording to the circumstances and the culture of the society one lives\nin. {{cite journal|url = http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1126418?uid=-\n3739864&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&uid=3739256& sid=56297672373 |volume = 21\n|issue = 1 |last = Wechsler |first = David |title = Intellectual Development and\nPsychological Maturity |journal = Child Development |year = 1950}} Adult\ndevelopment and maturity theories include the purpose in life concept, in which\nmaturity emphasizes a clear comprehension of life's purpose, directedness, and\nintentionality which, contributes to the feeling that life is\nmeaningful.\n\nThe status of maturity is distinguished by the shift away from reliance on\nguardianship and the oversight of an adult in decision-making acts. Maturity has\ndifferent definitions across legal, social, sexual, emotional, and intellectual\ncontexts. The age or qualities assigned for each of these contexts are tied to\nculturally-significant indicators of independence that often vary as a result of\nreligious or social sentiments. The concept of psychological maturity has\nimplications across both legal and social contexts, while a combination of\npolitical activism and scientific evidence continue to reshape and qualify its\ndefinition. Even so, both principles of maturity and immaturity share a long\nhistory in human evolution and have far-reaching implications for the timing and\nduration of sexual and physical development.\n\nJerome Bruner proposed the purpose of the period of immaturity as being a time\nfor experimental play without serious consequences, where a young animal can\nspend a great deal of time observing the actions of skilled others in\ncoordination with oversight by and activity with its mother. Bruner, J.S.\n(1972). The nature and uses of immaturity. American Psychologist, 27, 687-\n708. The key to human innovation through the use of symbols and tools,\ntherefore, is re-interpretive imitation that is âpracticed, perfected, and\nvaried in playâ through extensive exploration of the limits on oneâs ability to\ninteract with the world. Evolutionary psychologists have also hypothesized that\ncognitive immaturity may serve an adaptive purpose as a protective barrier for\nchildren against their own under-developed meta-cognition and judgment, a\nvulnerability that may put them in harmâs way. Bjorklund, D. F. (1997). The\nrole of immaturity in human development. Psychological Bulletin, 122, 153-\n169. For youth today, the steadily extending period of âplayâ and\nschooling going into the 21st century comes as a result of the increasing\ncomplexity of our world and its technologies, which too demand an increasing\nintricacy of skill as well as a more exhaustive set of pre-requisite abilities.\nMany of the behavioral and emotional problems associated with adolescence may\narise as children cope with the increased demands placed on them, demands which\nhave become increasingly abstracted from the work and expectations of adulthood.\n","linknr":216,"url":"Maturity_(psychological)","recorded":1362486151,"links":18,"instances":["sociology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental psychology","Human behavior"],"headings":["Socio-emotional and cognitive markers","Biological and evolutionary markers","Legal and Political issues","Cultural and religious issues","Age","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["norm","sociology"]],"members":["norm"],"related":["Psychology","Social_environment","Norm_(sociology)","Instinct","Guardianship","Jerome_Bruner","Autonomy","Erikson's_stages_of_psychosocial_development","Pre-frontal_cortex","Myelination","Juvenile_offender","Legal_age","Age_of_majority","Mentally_disabled","Death_penalty","Jewish","Bat_Mitzvah","Torah","Christian","Confirmation","Prom","Quinceañera","Menarche","Scarification","Hazing","Ageing","Law","Driving","Age_of_consent","Contract","Judge","Julian_Mack","Juvenile_court","United_States","Religion","Politics","Genetic_engineering","Abortion","Mental_age","Adult","End-of-history_illusion","Mature_minor_doctrine"]}
