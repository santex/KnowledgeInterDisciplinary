{"cursor":"54567","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Biomolecular engineering' is the application of engineering principles and\npractices to the purposeful manipulation of molecules of biological origin.\nBiomolecular engineers integrate knowledge of biological processes with the core\nknowledge of chemical engineering in order to focus on molecular level solutions\nto issues and problems in the life sciences related to the environment,\nagriculture, energy, industry, food production, biotechnology and medicine.\nBiomolecular engineers purposefully manipulate carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic\nacids and lipids within the framework of the relation between their structure,\nfunction and properties and in relation to applicability to such areas as\nenvironmental remediation, crop and life stock production, biofuel cells and\nbiomolecular diagnostics. Fundamental attention is given to the thermodynamics\nand kinetics of molecular recognition in enzymes, antibodies, DNA hybridization,\nbio-conjugation/ bio-immobilization and bioseparations. Attention is also given\nto the rudiments of engineered biomolecules in cell signaling, cell growth\nkinetics, biochemical pathway engineering and bioreactor engineering.\nBiomolecular engineers are leading the major shift towards understanding and\ncontrolling the molecular mechanisms that define life as we know it.\n","linknr":670,"url":"Biomolecular_engineering","recorded":1362508498,"links":32,"instances":["biology","molecular_biology","chemistry","biology","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.clemson.edu/ces/chbe/documents/2011_BMOLE_curriculum.pdf","http://www.clemson.edu/ces/chbe/documents/bmole_graduate_course_descriptions_updated_nov_09.pdf","http://www.chbe.gatech.edu/ugrads/standard/12/pdfs/curriculum.pdf","http://www.chbmeng.ohio-state.edu/undergrad/0708_BioBingo.pdf","http://www.che.udel.edu/downloads/Fall10_CHEGCurriculum.pdf","http://www.che.ufl.edu/PDF/CurrentUnderGradStudents/MinorBiomolecular_Mar08.pdf","http://www.upenn.edu/registrar/register/cbe.pdf","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/bp088059d/pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/253/18/6551.full.pdf","http://www.jbc.org/content/253/18/6551.full.pdf","http://www.haspi.org/curriculum-library/Microbio-Biotech/08%20Applied%20Microbiology%20and%20Biotechnology/LindeTechnology_1-04_Biotechnology_eng.pdf","http://www.haspi.org/curriculum-library/Microbio-Biotech/08%20Applied%20Microbiology%20and%20Biotechnology/LindeTechnology_1-04_Biotechnology_eng.pdf"],"categories":["Biological
