{"cursor":"6543","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Wind engineering' analyzes effects of wind in the natural and the built\nenvironment and studies the possible damage, inconvenience or benefits which may\nresult from wind. In the field of structural engineering it includes strong\nwinds, which may cause discomfort, as well as extreme winds, such as in a\ntornado, hurricane or heavy storm, which may cause widespread destruction. In\nthe fields of wind energy and air pollution it also includes low and moderate\nwinds as these are relevant to electricity production resp. dispersion of\ncontaminants.\n\nWind engineering draws upon meteorology, fluid dynamics, mechanics, Geographic\nInformation Systems and a number of specialist engineering disciplines including\naerodynamics, and structural dynamics. The tools used include atmospheric\nmodels, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels, open jet facilities \n and computational fluid dynamics models.\n\nWind engineering involves, among other topics:\n* Wind impact on structures (buildings, bridges, towers).\n* Wind comfort near buildings.\n* Effects of wind on the ventilation system in a building.\n* Wind climate for wind energy.\n* Air pollution near buildings.\n\nWind engineering may be considered by structural engineers to be closely related\nto earthquake engineering and explosion protection.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Wind_engineering","recorded":1362890852,"links":14,"instances":["united_kingdom"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineering disciplines","Structural engineering","Wind"],"headings":["History","Wind loads on buildings","Wind turbines","Significance","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/9/7/f9727c43c1d798162ca5359340f8412f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/4/6/246f04dc57329fc7c68da6476f279ecd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/d/c1d679998e89c739748925f4c5236647.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/1/9/a19253a9998bae7213e841d369837e13.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/6/2/e627295164217646b7e14e1d73840795.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/6/7/267bff78ef51ee21aa59189098e319cc.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/d/5/4d5ca1c890673556b4fd01546e781782.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/6/b/06b511db258a036094f10a747d764538.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/5/1/2510c39011c5be704182423e3a695e91.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/5/7e5cb50b59afa23990a30beeac37ff76.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/b/5/ab56e5d64972dde5921578857e1e1e14.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/7/e/c7e68f7a515a9521684d0ecd46aaa6b4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["national_physical_laboratory","united_kingdom"]],"members":["national_physical_laboratory"],"related":["Wind","Built_environment","Structural_engineering","Tornado","Hurricane","Heavy_storm","Wind_energy","Air_pollution","Meteorology","Fluid_dynamics","Mechanics","Geographic_Information_System","Engineering","Aerodynamics","Structural_dynamics","Atmospheric_model","Wind_tunnel","Computational_fluid_dynamics","Earthquake_engineering","Explosion_protection","National_Physical_Laboratory_(United_Kingdom)","Extreme_value_theory","Douglas","Central_Scotland","Wind_turbine","High_rise","Suspension_bridge","Cable-stayed_bridge","Telecommunication_tower","Cable_bridge","Hurricane_engineering","Wind_tunnel","Vibration_control","John_Twidell"]}
