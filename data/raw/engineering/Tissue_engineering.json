{"cursor":"32101","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Tissue engineering' is the use of a combination of cells, engineering and\nmaterials methods, and suitable biochemical and physio-chemical factors to\nimprove or replace biological functions. While it was once categorized as a sub-\nfield of bio materials, having grown in scope and importance it can be\nconsidered as a field in its own right.\n\nWhile most definitions of tissue engineering cover a broad range of\napplications, in practice the term is closely associated with applications that\nrepair or replace portions of or whole tissues (i.e., bone, cartilage, blood\nvessels, bladder, skin, muscle etc.). Often, the tissues involved require\ncertain mechanical and structural properties for proper functioning. The term\nhas also been applied to efforts to perform specific biochemical functions using\ncells within an artificially-created support system (e.g. an artificial\npancreas, or a bio artificial liver). The term [[Stem cell\ntreatments|regenerative medicine]] is often used synonymously with tissue\nengineering, although those involved in regenerative medicine place more\nemphasis on the use of stem cells to produce tissues.\n","linknr":885,"url":"Tissue_engineering","recorded":1362510205,"links":47,"instances":["medical","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/ejb/v3n2/art03.pdf","http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/ejb/v3n2/art03.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical
