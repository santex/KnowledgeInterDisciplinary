{"cursor":"15891","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'central dogma of molecular biology' describes the flow of genetic\ninformation within a biological system. It was first stated by Francis Crick in\n1958 Crick, F.H.C. (1958):\n[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/F/T/_/scbbft.pdf On Protein Synthesis.]\nSymp. Soc. Exp. Biol. XII, 139-163. (pdf, early draft of original article)\nand re-stated in a [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] paper published in 1970:\n\n\n\n:The central dogma of [[molecular biology]] deals with the detailed residue-by-\nresidue transfer of [[DNA sequencing|sequential information]]. It states that\nsuch information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or\nnucleic acid.\n\nOr, as Marshall Nirenberg said, \"DNA makes RNA makes protein.\" {{cite web\n| last = Leavitt first = Sarah A. authorlink = coauthors = Marshall Nirenberg\n| title = Deciphering the Genetic Code: Marshall Nirenberg work = publisher =\n| Office of NIH History date = June 2010 url =\n| http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/nirenberg/glossary.htm doi = accessdate =\n| }}\n\nTo appreciate the significance of the concept, note that Crick had misapplied\nthe term \"dogma\" in ignorance. In evolutionary or molecular biological theory,\neither then or subsequently, Crick's proposal had nothing to do with the correct\nmeaning of \"dogma\". He subsequently documented this error in his autobiography.\n\nThe dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of sequence information\nbetween sequential information-carrying biopolymers, in the most common or\ngeneral case, in living organisms. There are 3 major classes of such\nbiopolymers: DNA and RNA (both nucleic acids), and protein. There are 3Ã3 = 9\nconceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these. The\ndogma classes these into 3 groups of 3: 3 'general transfers' (believed to occur\nnormally in most cells), 3 'special transfers' (known to occur, but only under\nspecific conditions in case of some viruses or in a laboratory), and 3 'unknown\ntransfers' (believed never to occur). The general transfers describe the normal\nflow of biological information: DNA can be copied to DNA (DNA replication), DNA\ninformation can be copied into mRNA (transcription), and proteins can be\nsynthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (translation).\n","linknr":414,"url":"Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","recorded":1362374064,"links":47,"instances":["biology","genetics","genetics"],"pdf":["http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/F/T/_/scbbft.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/crick/pdf/crick227.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/crick/pdf/crick227.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular biology","Molecular genetics"],"headings":["Biological sequence information","General transfers of biological sequential information","Special transfers of biological sequential information","Transfers of information not explicitly covered in the theory","Use of the term \"dogma\"","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Centraldogma_nodetails.GIF/160px-Centraldogma_nodetails.GIF","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ee/Cdmb.svg/256px-Cdmb.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg/256px-Central_Dogma_of_Molecular_Biochemistry_with_Enzymes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/Extended_Central_Dogma_with_Enzymes.jpg/550px-Extended_Central_Dogma_with_Enzymes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["sequence","biology"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["sequence","translation","transcription"],"related":["Francis_Crick","Marshall_Nirenberg","Dogma","Sequence","Information","Biopolymer","Organism","DNA","RNA","Nucleic_acids","Protein","DNA_replication","MRNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(genetics)","Biopolymer","Amino_acid","Sequence_(biology)","Deterministic","Messenger_RNA","RNA_polymerase","Transcription_factor","Eukaryote","Precursor_mRNA","Post-transcriptional_modification","5'_cap","Polyadenylation","RNA_splicing","Alternative_splicing","Ribosome","Translation_(genetics)","Prokaryotic","Eukaryotic","Cell_nucleus","Cytoplasm","Genetic_code","Adenine","Uracil","Guanine","Methionine","Ribosome","Initiation_factor","Elongation_factor","Aminoacylation","Transfer_RNA","Amino_acid","Stop_codon","Chaperone_protein","Intein","Replisome","Helicase","Superhelix","Nucleic_acid_double_helix","DNA_polymerase","S_phase","Cell_cycle","Retrovirus","HIV","Eukaryote","Retrotransposon","Telomere","RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase","RNA_silencing","RNA_editing","Neomycin","Homing_endonuclease","DNA_methylation","Gene_expression","Methylase","Epigenetic","Somatic_epitype","Prion","Fungi","James_A._Shapiro","Natural_genetic_engineering","Autobiography","Hypothesis","Sequence_hypothesis","Jacques_Monod","Horace_Freeland_Judson","Weismann_barrier","Genetic_code","Alternative_splicing","Riboswitch"]}
