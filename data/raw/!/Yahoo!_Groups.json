Groups' is one of the worldâs largest collections of online discussion\nboards. The term Groups refers to Internet communication which is a hybrid\nbetween an electronic mailing list and a threaded Internet forum, in other\nwords, Group messages can be read and posted by e-mail or on the Group's webpage\nlike a web forum. In addition, members can choose whether to receive individual,\ndaily digest or Special Delivery e-mails, or simply read Group posts on the\nGroupâs web site. Groups can be created with public or member-only access. Some\nGroups are simply announcement bulletin boards, to which only the Group\nmoderators can post, while others are discussion forums.\n\nIt is not necessary to register with Yahoo! in order to participate in Yahoo!\nGroups. The basic mailing list functionality is available to any e-mail address,\nbut a Yahoo! ID is required to access some other features.\n\nDespite their popularity Yahoo! Groups have been called \"a goldmine... Yahoo!\nhas never cashed in on\". http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-burrus/yahoo-\ngroups_b_1611741.html?utm_hp_r\\ ef=technology&ir=Technology\n","linknr":419,"url":"Yahoo!_Groups","recorded":1362477194,"links":21,"instances":["engineer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Yahoo!
