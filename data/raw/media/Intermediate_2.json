{"cursor":"3133","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Intermediate 2' level is Level 5 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications\nFramework. It is the level between Higher and Standard Grade Credit\n\nIt was initially available to pupils (generally in S5) who achieved a grade 3 or\n4 Standard Grade but, with some schools choosing to use Intermediates over\nStandard Grade, it is now more available to S3/S4 pupils (dependent upon the\nschool or individual departments within schools choice). It is believed that in\ncertain subjects Intermediates are more useful to the students than Standard\nGrades because the work required for completion is more demanding, and better\nprepares the pupils for Higher, with a similar format to the reformed higher\nexams. Furthermore the pupils are introduced to Higher work before they have sat\ntheir Intermediate 2 exam which also makes the transition easier (again this is\nvery much dependent upon the subject).\n\nThe Intermediate 2 courses are generally made up of 3 national units, the main\nexceptions are English, Physics, and French, with mandatory internal assessments\nin each. The courses all consist of 40 hours. Mandatory passes are needed in the\ninternal assessments or NAB's National Assessment Bank to gain the overall\nCourse Award. However internal assessments are minimum competence, and so many\nschools have introduced end-of-unit assessments to help stop complacency.\n\nAs with other exams in the Higher Still curriculum, the grades pupils can\nreceive in the final exam are A (usually about 70%+), B (usually about 60%+), a\nC (usually about 50%+), a D (usually 45%-49%) or a Fail (below 45%).\n\nPupils also sit preliminary exams (more commonly referred to as \"Prelims\" or, in\nsome schools, \"Mocks\") before the final exams usually sat in December or\nJanuary. These exams are held under exam conditions and are intended to be more\nchallenging than the final exam and to help prepare them for it. If the pupil\npasses the Prelim of a certain subject, it can be used as an appeal if they fail\nto attend, or achieve their expected grade in the final exam.\n\nThe next level of education provided in Scotland are the \"Highers\"\n","linknr":81,"url":"Intermediate_2","recorded":1363182373,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Scottish_Credit_and_Qualifications_Framework","/wiki/National_Assessment_Bank","/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)","/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/File:Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_bookcase.svg.png","/wiki/Education_in_Scotland","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Scotland-edu-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Scotland-edu-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Scotland-edu-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&oldid=523928236","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Educational_qualifications_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Secondary_school_qualifications","/wiki/Category:School_examinations","/wiki/Category:Secondary_education_in_Scotland","/wiki/Category:Scotland_education_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Intermediate+2&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Intermediate+2","/wiki/Intermediate_2","/wiki/Talk:Intermediate_2","#","/wiki/Intermediate_2","/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Intermediate_2","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Intermediate_2","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&oldid=523928236","/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Intermediate_2&id=523928236","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Intermediate+2","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Intermediate+2&oldid=523928236&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Intermediate_2&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_2","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["scottish"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Educational
