{"cursor":"10787","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Bioremediation' is the use of micro-organism metabolism to remove pollutants.\nTechnologies can be generally classified as [[in situ]] or [[ex situ]]. In situ\nbioremediation involves treating the contaminated material at the site, while ex\nsitu involves the removal of the contaminated material to be treated elsewhere.\nSome examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation,\nbioventing, bioleaching, landfarming, bioreactor, composting, bioaugmentation,\nrhizofiltration, and biostimulation.\n\nBioremediation can occur on its own (natural attenuation or intrinsic\nbioremediation) or can be spurred on via the addition of fertilizers to increase\nthe bioavailability within the medium (biostimulation). Recent advancements have\nalso proven successful via the addition of matched microbe strains to the medium\nto enhance the resident microbe population's ability to break down contaminants.\nMicroorganisms used to perform the function of bioremediation are known as\n'bioremediators'.\n\nNot all contaminants, however, are easily treated by bioremediation using\nmicroorganisms. For example, heavy metals such as cadmium and lead are not\nreadily absorbed or captured by microorganisms. The assimilation of metals such\nas mercury into the food chain may worsen matters. Phytoremediation is useful in\nthese circumstances because natural plants or transgenic plants are able to\nbioaccumulate these toxins in their above-ground parts, which are then harvested\nfor removal. The heavy metals in the harvested biomass may be further\nconcentrated by incineration or even recycled for industrial use.\n\nThe elimination of a wide range of pollutants and wastes from the environment\nrequires increasing our understanding of the relative importance of different\npathways and regulatory networks to carbon flux in particular environments and\nfor particular compounds, and they will certainly accelerate the development of\nbioremediation technologies and biotransformation processes.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Bioremediation","recorded":1362509983,"links":34,"instances":["element","environmental","statistics","engineering","biochemistry","nerve_agent"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bioremediation|","Biotechnology","Environmental soil science","Environmental engineering","Environmental terminology","Conservation projects","Ecological restoration","Soil contamination"],"headings":["Genetic engineering approaches","Mycoremediation","Advantages","Monitoring bioremediation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["mercury","element"],["vx","nerve_agent"],["earthworks","engineering"],["hypoxia","environmental"],["fermentation","biochemistry"],["sample","statistics"]],"members":["mercury","hypoxia","sample","earthworks","fermentation","vx"],"related":["Micro-organism","Phytoremediation","Bioventing","Bioleaching","Landfarming","Bioreactor","Composting","Bioaugmentation","Rhizofiltration","Biostimulation","Heavy_metals","Cadmium","Lead","Mercury_(element)","Food_chain","Phytoremediation","Transgenic_plant","Bioaccumulate","Carbon_flux","Biotransformation","Genetic_engineering","Bacteria","Radioresistance","Toluene","Ion","Mercury_(element)","Fungi","Mycelium","Fungi","Ecosystem","Decomposition","Enzyme","Acid","Lignin","Cellulose","Carbon","Hydrogen","Nerve_gas","VX_(nerve_agent)","Sarin","Diesel_fuel","Oyster_mushroom","Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon","Petroleum","Pesticides","Microorganism","Earthworks_(engineering)","Hydrocarbon","Petrol","Groundwater","Concentration","Incineration","Redox","Soil","PH","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Volt","Aerobic_organism","Hypoxia_(environmental)","Denitrification","Manganese","Iron","Sulfate","Fermentation_(biochemistry)","Environmental_remediation","Sample_(statistics)","Contour_line","Software","Kriging","Biodegradation","Bioleaching","Biosurfactant","Dutch_standards","Folkewall","List_of_environment_topics","Living_machines","Living_wall","Microbial_biodegradation","Mycoremediation","Phytoremediation","US_Microbics","Xenocatabolism"]}
