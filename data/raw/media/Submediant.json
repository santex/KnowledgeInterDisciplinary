Benward & Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I,\np.33. Seventh Edition. ISBN 978-0-07-294262-0. It is also the third factor\nof the subdominant (IV) triad. It is occasionally called 'superdominant', being\nabove the dominant.\n\nIn music theory, the submediant chord is symbolized by the Roman numeral VI if\nit is major or vi if it is minor.\n\nFor example, in the C major scale (white keys on a piano, starting on C), the\nsubmediant is the note A; and the submediant chord is A-minor consisting of the\nnotes A, C, and E. Therefore, Am is the vi chord in the C major scale. Since the\nsubmediant is minor it may provide contrast with major chords, frequently in a\nsequence of descending thirds (I, vi, IV, ii | V in root position or first\ninversion). Further, in the A natural minor scale (same\nwhite keys, now starting on A), the submediant is the note F; and the submediant\nchord is F (or F-major) consisting of the notes F, A, and C. Therefore, F is the\nVI chord in the A (natural) minor scale.\n\n\nThe submediant is also in the same relationship to the supertonic as the\nsupertonic is to the dominant, resulting in a descending series of perfect\nfifths known as an extended dominant relationship. William\nG Andrews and Molly Sclater (2000). Materials of Western Music Part 1, p.226.\nISBN 1-55122-034-2. See: predominant and circle progression.\n\nChadwick, G.H. (2009). Harmony - A Course Of Study, p.36. ISBN 1-4446-4428-\n9. .]] The submediant is usually preceded by the mediant, tonic, or\ndominant and succeeded by supertonic, dominant, or subdominant. Benjamin,\nHorvit, and Nelson (2007). Techniques and Materials of Music: From the Common\nPractice Period Through the Twentieth Century, p.100. ISBN 0-495-18977-4.\nThe submediant function is easily explained in reference to jazz music, where it\nis used in the \"ice cream change\" or \"Blues for Alice\" progression, which moves\nfrom the tonic through the submediant on the way to the ubiquitous ii-V-I Jazz\nsequence (part of the cycle of fifths). The progression's consistency is\namplified by the submediant's fifth-relationship above the supertonic. This\nsubmediant roleâin which it essentially extends from the tonic as a way of\npassing to a subdominant (IV) or supertonic (II) harmony, is as common in\npopular and classical music as it is in jazz, or any other musical language\nrelated to Western European tonality.\n\nBoth vi 6 and iii 6 are weak and rarely independent, being\neither linear chords or with the third or sixth scale degree as a nonharmonic\ntone. Benjamin, et al. (2007), p.101.\n\n\"Submediant\" also refers to a relationship of musical keys. For example,\nrelative to the key of C major, the key of A major (or A minor) is the\nsubmediant. Modulation (change of key) to the submediant is relatively rare,\ncompared with, for instance, modulation to the dominant, and gives a feeling of\nrelaxation. Susan McClary says that modulation to the lowered submediant (in C:\nA) represents a dream-like state of escape.\n\nIn German theory derived from Hugo Riemann the submediant in major is\nconsidered the tonic parallel (US relative), Tp, and the minor the subdominant\nparallel, sP.\n\nChromatic submediants are, like all chromatic mediants, chords whose roots are\nrelated by a major third or minor third, contain one common tone, and share the\nsame quality, i.e. major or minor. They may be altered chords.\n\n\nIn rock and popular music, VI in minor often uses the chromatically lowered\nfifth scale degree as its seventh, VI7, for example as in Eric Clapton's\nclearly minor mode \"I Shot The Sheriff\".
