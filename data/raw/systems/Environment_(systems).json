It is also known as the 'surroundings',\nand in thermodynamics, as the 'reservoir'. Depending on the type of system, it\nmay interact with the environment by exchanging mass, energy (including heat and\nwork), linear momentum, angular momentum, electric charge, or other conserved\nproperties. In some disciplines, such as information theory, information may\nalso be exchanged. The environment is ignored in analysis of the system, except\nin regards to these interactions.
