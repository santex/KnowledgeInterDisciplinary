The song is\nnotable for being the first single in which Clarkson explores the \"pop rock\"\nelement that would later define her career in singles like \"Breakaway\" and\n\"Since U Been Gone\", however the intro guitar riff gives the song a minor R&B\nelement. It opens with a guitar chord strum, played backwards.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Low_(Kelly_Clarkson_song)","recorded":1362477719,"links":29,"instances":["kelly_clarkson_song","kelly_clarkson_song","kelly_clarkson_album"],"pdf":[],"categories":["2003 singles","Kelly Clarkson songs","Pop rock songs","Songs written by Jimmy Harry","Pop ballads","Rock ballads","RCA Records singles"],"headings":["Music video","Chart performance","Formats and track listings","Release history","Charts","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Low_Single.PNG/220px-Low_Single.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/Kelly_clarkson_low_cd_single_aus.jpg/220px-Kelly_clarkson_low_cd_single_aus.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/People_icon.svg/16px-People_icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["thankful","kelly_clarkson_album"],["miss_independent","kelly_clarkson_song"],["breakaway","kelly_clarkson_song"],["miss_independent","kelly_clarkson_song"]],"members":["breakaway","miss_independent","thankful"],"related":["Kelly_Clarkson","Thankful_(Kelly_Clarkson_album)","CD_single","Music_download","Pop_rock","Contemporary_R&B","RCA_Records","Jimmy_Harry","Miss_Independent_(Kelly_Clarkson_song)","The_Trouble_with_Love_Is","Pop_rock","Kelly_Clarkson","Pop_rock","Breakaway_(Kelly_Clarkson_song)","Since_U_Been_Gone","A_Moment_Like_This","Before_Your_Love","A_Moment_Like_This","Miss_Independent_(Kelly_Clarkson_song)","Billboard_Hot_100","Top_40_Tracks","Hot_100_Airplay","Top_40_Mainstream","United_Kingdom","Double_A-side","The_Trouble_with_Love_Is","Australia","Canada","The_Trouble_with_Love_Is","United_States","RCA_Records","Australia","BMG","Australian_Recording_Industry_Association","UK_Singles_Charts","Billboard_Hot_100","Top_40_Mainstream"]}
