{"cursor":"26733","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n]] 'Power in International Relations' is defined in several different ways.\nPolitical scientists, historians, and practitioners of international relations\n(diplomats) have used the following concepts of political power:\n\n*Power as a 'goal' of states or leaders; *Power as a 'measure' of influence or\ncontrol over outcomes, events, actors and issues; *Power as reflecting 'victory'\nin conflict and the attainment of '[[international security|security]]'; *Power\nas 'control' over resources and capabilities; *Power as 'status', which some\nstates or actors possess and other do not.\n\nModern discourse generally speaks in terms of state power, indicating both\neconomic and military power. Those states that have significant amounts of power\nwithin the international system are referred to as middle powers, regional\npowers, great powers, superpowers, or hyperpowers/hegemons, although there is no\ncommonly accepted standard for what defines a powerful state.\n\nEntities other than states can also acquire and wield power in international\nrelations. Such entities can include multilateral international organizations,\nmilitary alliance organizations like NATO, multinational corporations like Wal-\nMart, non-governmental organizations, the Roman Catholic Church, Al-\nQaeda, or other institutions such as the Hanseatic League.\n","linknr":492,"url":"Power_(international_relations)","recorded":1362664892,"links":28,"instances":["economics","social_and_political","systems_engineering"],"pdf":["http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/army-usawc/strategy2004/17marcella.pdf","http://post.queensu.ca/~nossalk/pols369/readings/chapnick_middle.pdf"],"categories":["Geopolitical
