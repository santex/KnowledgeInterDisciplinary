RETORNEMOS AO PASTOR QUE APASCENTA A VIDA.\nhttp://derv.wordpress.com/page/3/\n\nHe finds on the post-modern thinking and its concepts of performativity,\nutility, and lucrativity, and the Bauhaus model of bricolage a new scientific\nparadigm. The post-modern paradigm broke with the modern paradigm of\nrationality. WESTPHAL, Euler R. O Oitavo Dia: Na era da seleÃ§Ã£o natural,\npages 5ff.\n\nThe post-modernism look at the nature as a good thing when it is useful to the\nhumankind, because science and human power are coincident. In the post-modern\nreligion the eschatological and messianic hope is no more in Jesus Christ, but\nin the efforts to find out a possibility to immortality, good wealth and eternal\nlife through genetical improvement. The wishes of the post-modern man are to\nreach the perfect human being, the great wealth, without illness and death, the\nbrave new world. Id. Ibid, pages 20ff.\n\nWhen science becomes religion and the scientists become priests the humankind\nstarts a new age of totalitarianism of science. The reality of the Almighty God,\nCreator and Redeemer, is no more recognized by post-modern man, who now adopt\nthe performativity and lucrativity as a new dogma of scientific religion.\nPredestination is no more a Christian dogma but a concept of biotechnology. The\nscientist can see, as a small-great-god, who is predestined by the genetic code\nto develop an illness, like a cancer. Therefore the scientist became the one who\ncan chose life or death for a new life under formation. Id. Ibid, pages\n40ff. 88 There are many risks on see the science as a religion. Or to put\nthe science as criteria of truth, specially this kind of science that has on post-\nmodern thinking its epistemological base. The practice of get patents of living\nbeing its one of these kinds of risks. When an economical group has the patent\nof a soy bean, than the farmers cannot produce soy without pay royalties to the\ncompany that has the patent rights. So poor people at south countries will have\ntheir free access to seeds for planting not allowed, in consequence they will\nnot have food for their countries. Id. Ibid, pages 60ff.\n\nThe bioethics is multidisciplinary subject, it dialogues with different ethical\nissues like philosophical ethics, medical ethics, theological ethics and so one.\nTheology can give its contribution on situations like abort, euthanasia,\nresearch with living beings. The Christian faith can recover the respect with\nlife and its mystery. Id. Ibid, pages 80ff.\n\nIn the Eighth Day the human being has created the brave new world. The little-man-\ngod redesigned the life beings and the human being as image and likeness of the\nMarket-God's utilitarists interests. We need to give the appropriate place to\nthe creation and to the human beings as creation of the Triune God. All things\nare maintained by the presence of His Holy Spirit. Humility of the science will\nguarantee that science still be science and not became a religion that promise\neternal life, immortality and salvation. Id. Ibid, pages 110ff.\n","linknr":100,"url":"The_Eighth_Day_(book)","recorded":1364143809,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Euler_Renato_Westphal","/wiki/Systematic_Theology","/wiki/Bioethics","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Bauhaus","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Post-modernism","/wiki/Brave_new_world","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Predestination","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Theology","#cite_note-8","#cite_note-9","#cite_ref-1","http://elistas.alcnoticias.org/lista/portugues_alc/archivo/indice/921/msg/881/","#cite_ref-2","http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.jsp?id=K4796349P9&tipo=completo&idiomaExibicao=1","http://www.flt.edu.br/bacharelado/Grade%20Curricular%20Curso%20de%20Teologia.pdf","#cite_ref-3","http://www3.est.edu.br/publicacoes/estudos_teologicos/vol4702_2007/ET2007-2d_rvsinner.pdf","http://derv.wordpress.com/page/3/","#cite_ref-4","#cite_ref-5","#cite_ref-6","#cite_ref-7","#cite_ref-8","#cite_ref-9","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&oldid=542588473","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:2004_books","/wiki/Category:Christian_theology_books","/wiki/Category:Bioethics","/wiki/Category:Brazilian_books","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Eighth+Day+%28book%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Eighth+Day+%28book%29","/wiki/The_Eighth_Day_(book)","/wiki/Talk:The_Eighth_Day_(book)","#","/wiki/The_Eighth_Day_(book)","/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/The_Eighth_Day_(book)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/The_Eighth_Day_(book)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&oldid=542588473","/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=The_Eighth_Day_%28book%29&id=542588473","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=The+Eighth+Day+%28book%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=The+Eighth+Day+%28book%29&oldid=542588473&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=The_Eighth_Day_(book)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eighth_Day_(book)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.flt.edu.br/bacharelado/Grade%20Curricular%20Curso%20de%20Teologia.pdf","http://www3.est.edu.br/publicacoes/estudos_teologicos/vol4702_2007/ET2007-2d_rvsinner.pdf"],"categories":["2004
