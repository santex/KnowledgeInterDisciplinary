Usually these books are written for a wide audience presumed to\nhave a general education rather than a specifically scientific training, as\nopposed to the very narrow audience that a scientific paper would have, and are\ntherefore referred to as popular science. As such, they require considerable\ntalent on the part of the author to sufficiently explain difficult topics to\npeople who are totally new to the subject, and a good blend of storytelling and\ntechnical writing. In the UK, [http://royalsociety.org/sciencebooks/ The Royal\nSociety Winton Prize for Science Books], formerly The Aventis Prizes for Science\nBooks are considered to be the most prestigious awards for science\nwriting.

In the US, the National\nBook Awards briefly had a category for science writing in the 1960s, but now\nthey just have the broad categories of fiction and nonfiction.\n\nThere are many disciplines that are well explained to lay people through science\nbooks. A few examples include Carl Sagan on astronomy, Jared Diamond on\ngeography, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins on evolutionary biology, Donald\nNorman on usability and cognitive psychology, Steven Pinker, Noam Chomsky, and\nRobert Ornstein on linguistics and cognitive science, Donald Johanson and Robert\nArdrey on paleoanthropology, and Desmond Morris on zoology and anthropology, and\nFulvio Melia on black holes.\n","recorded":1362124364,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"67","instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Science books"],"headings":["References","External links"],"tags":[],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Nonfiction","Scientist","Researcher","Professor","Stephen_Hawking","Bill_Bryson","Scientific_paper","Popular_science","Explain","Storytelling","Technical_writing","The_Aventis_Prizes_for_Science_Books","National_Book_Awards","Carl_Sagan","Astronomy","Jared_Diamond","Geography","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Richard_Dawkins","Evolutionary_biology","Donald_Norman","Usability","Cognitive_psychology","Steven_Pinker","Noam_Chomsky","Robert_Ornstein","Linguistics","Cognitive_science","Donald_Johanson","Robert_Ardrey","Paleoanthropology","Desmond_Morris","Zoology","Anthropology","Fulvio_Melia","Black_holes","University_of_California_Santa_Cruz"],"members":[],"book":[]}
