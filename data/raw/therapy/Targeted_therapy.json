Radiotherapy is not considered a 'targeted therapy'\ndespite it being often aimed at the tumours.\n\nTargeted cancer therapies are expected to be more effective than current\ntreatments and less harmful to normal cells.\n\nThere are targeted therapies for breast cancer, multiple myeloma, lymphoma,\nprostate cancer, melanoma and other cancers.
