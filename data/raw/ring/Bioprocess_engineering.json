{"cursor":"2437","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Bioprocess Engineering' is a specialization of Biotechnology, Biological\nEngineering, Chemical Engineering or of Agricultural Engineering. It deals with\nthe design and development of equipment and processes for the manufacturing of\nproducts such as food, feed, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, chemicals, and\npolymers and paper from biological materials. Bioproceess engineering is a\nconglomerate of mathematics, biology and industrial design,and consists of\nvarious spectrums like designing of bioreactors, study of fermentors (mode of\noperations etc). It also deals with studying various biotechnological processes\nused in industries for large scale production of biological product for\noptimization of yield in the end product and the quality of end product. Bio\nprocess engineering may include the work of mechanical, electrical, and\nindustrial engineers to apply principles of their disciplines to processes based\non using living cells or sub component of such cells.
