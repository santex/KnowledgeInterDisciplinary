Particularly important in the\ncare of diabetes mellitus, a blood glucose test is performed by piercing the\nskin (typically, on the finger) to draw blood, then applying the blood to a\nchemically active disposable 'test-strip'. Different manufacturers use different\ntechnology, but most systems measure an electrical characteristic, and use this\nto determine the glucose level in the blood. The test is usually referred to as\ncapillary blood glucose and sometimes incorrectly called BM Stix (after one of\nthe companies that makes the test kit).\n\nHealthcare professionals advise patients with diabetes on the appropriate\nmonitoring regime for their condition. Most people with Type 2 diabetes test at\nleast once per day. Diabetics who use insulin (all Type 1 diabetes and many Type\n2s) usually test their blood sugar more often (3 to 10 times per day), both to\nassess the effectiveness of their prior insulin dose and to help determine their\nnext insulin dose.\n\nImproved technology for measuring blood glucose is rapidly changing the\nstandards of care for all diabetic people.\n","linknr":275,"url":"Blood_glucose_monitoring","recorded":1362509997,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Blood tests","Diabetes","Insulin therapies"],"headings":["Purpose","Blood glucose meters","Continuous glucose monitoring","Glucose sensing bio-implants","Non-invasive technologies","Effectiveness","Blood glucose monitoring recommendations","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/26/Blood_Glucose_Testing.JPG/230px-Blood_Glucose_Testing.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Glucose_meters.jpg/300px-Glucose_meters.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Glucose","Glycemia","Diabetes_mellitus","Skin","Type_2_diabetes","Type_1_diabetes","Hyperglycemia","Hypoglycemia","Interstitial_fluid","Insulin","Glycosylated_hemoglobin","Health_insurance","Insulin","Insulin_pump","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Joseph_Wang","Near_infrared_spectroscopy","Ultrasound","Dielectric_spectroscopy","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Glycosylated_hemoglobin","Cardiovascular_disease","National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence","Glucose_meter"]}
