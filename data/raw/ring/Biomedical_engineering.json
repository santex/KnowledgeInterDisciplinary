This field seeks to\n close the gap between '[[engineering]]' and '[[medicine]]': It combines the\n design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical and biological\n sciences to advance healthcare treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring,\n treatment and therapy. [http://www.prospects.ac.uk/p/types_of_job/biomedic-\n al_engineer_job_description.jsp Biomedical engineer] prospects\n\nBiomedical engineering has only recently emerged as its own discipline, compared\nto many other engineering fields. Such an evolution is common as a new field\ntransitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-\nestablished fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in\nbiomedical engineering consists of research and development, spanning a broad\narray of subfields (see below). Prominent biomedical engineering applications\ninclude the development of biocompatible prostheses, various diagnostic and\ntherapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants,\ncommon imaging equipment such as MRIs and EEGs, regenerative tissue growth,\npharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals.\n","linknr":870,"url":"Biomedical_engineering","recorded":1362510105,"links":61,"instances":["medicine","uk"],"pdf":["http://newsletter.sgs.com/eNewsletterPro/uploadedimages/000006/sgs-safeguards-02412-exemptions-from-rohs-ii-directive-a4-en-12.pdf","http://www.techscience.com/mcb_pdf/v1n1/pdf/184288277842.pdf"],"categories":["Biomedical
