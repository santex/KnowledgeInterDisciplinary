En\nroute, they were to capture the Channel ports needed to supply the allied armies\nand clear the Germans from the Channel litoral and most of the launch sites for\nthe V-1 missiles. Most of the advance met with little more than sporadic\nresistance as the German 15th Army, wary of being outflanked and isolated by the\nrapidly advancing British 2nd Army, executed an orderly retreat north-eastwards\ntowards the Scheldt.\n\nResistance did occur in most of the Channel ports, designated on 4 September as\n\"fortresses\" by Adolf Hitler. Le Havre, Boulogne and Calais were subjected to\nfull-scale assaults, as a result. A further assault was called off at Dunkirk,\nfreeing resources for the clearing of the mouth of the Scheldt and the opening\nof the port of Antwerp. Two ports, Dieppe and Ostend were taken without\nopposition.\n","linknr":277,"url":"Clearing_the_Channel_Coast","recorded":1362538032,"links":28,"instances":["river","united_kingdom","canada","west_riding_infantry_division","united_kingdom","highland_infantry_division","united_kingdom","flying_bomb","wehrmacht"],"pdf":["http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/rep-rap/doc/cmhq/cmhq183.pdf","http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/rep-rap/doc/cmhq/cmhq183.pdf"],"categories":["Western European Campaign (1944â€“1945)","Battles of World War II involving Canada","Battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom","Battles of World War II involving France"],"headings":["Background","The Armies","Advance to the Seine","Crossing the Seine","Dieppe","Le Havre","Boulogne","Rocket sites","Calais and Cap Gris Nez","Dunkirk","Belgium","The Scheldt","Aftermath","References","Bibliography"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Strait_of_Dover_map.png/300px-Strait_of_Dover_map.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Canadian_Red_Ensign_1921-1957.svg/22px-Canadian_Red_Ensign_1921-1957.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Flag_of_Poland.svg/22px-Flag_of_Poland.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/22px-Flag_of_France.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Flag_of_Czechoslovakia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Czechoslovakia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg/22px-Flag_of_Belgium_%28civil%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg/22px-Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Canadian_Red_Ensign_1921-1957.svg/22px-Canadian_Red_Ensign_1921-1957.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg/22px-Flag_of_German_Reich_%281935%E2%80%931945%29.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["v-1","flying_bomb"],["15th_army","wehrmacht"],["i_corps","united_kingdom"],["i_corps","united_kingdom"],["49th","west_riding_infantry_division"],["51st","highland_infantry_division"],["touques","river"],["6th_airlanding_brigade","united_kingdom"],["6th_airborne_division","united_kingdom"],["i_corps","united_kingdom"],["department_of_national_defence","canada"],["department_of_national_defence","canada"]],"members":["touques","6th_airborne_division","department_of_national_defence","49th","6th_airlanding_brigade","51st","i_corps","15th_army"],"related":["Allied_advance_from_Paris_to_the_Rhine","Harry_Crerar","Gustav-Adolf_von_Zangen","World_War_II","1st_Canadian_Army","Allies_of_World_War_II","Normandy","Scheldt","Channel_ports","Litoral","V-1_(flying_bomb)","15th_Army_(Wehrmacht)","British_2nd_Army","German_World_War_II_strongholds","Adolf_Hitler","Le_Havre","Boulogne","Calais","Dunkirk","Battle_of_the_Scheldt","Antwerp","Dieppe,_Seine-Maritime","Ostend","Falaise_pocket","I_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","River_Dives","1st_Polish_Armoured_Division","Ypres","Adolf_Hitler","Dover","V-1_flying_bomb","2nd_Canadian_Corps","I_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","Conscript","John_Crocker","7th_Armoured_Division","49th_(West_Riding)_Infantry_Division","51st_(Highland)_Infantry_Division","British_6th_Airborne_Division","Operation_Tonga","D-Day","Richard_Nelson_Gale","1st_Belgian_Infantry_Brigade","Royal_Netherlands_Motorized_Infantry_Brigade","US_Third_Army","Elbeuf","Materiel","Touques_(river)","Lisieux","Caen","Risle","Brionne","11th_Hussars","6th_Airlanding_Brigade_(United_Kingdom)","6th_Airborne_Division_(United_Kingdom)","Honfleur","Pont_Audemer","Royal_Canadian_Engineers","3rd_Canadian_Infantry_Division","Elbeuf","2nd_Canadian_Infantry_Division","Dieppe_Raid","I_Corps_(United_Kingdom)","Hobart's_Funnies","Daniel_Spry","3rd_Canadian_Division","Wissant","German_World_War_II_strongholds","Materiel","1st_Czechoslovak_Armoured_Brigade","Belgian_Resistance","French_Resistance","1st_Polish_Armoured_Division","Ypres","Ghent-Bruges_canal","Operation_Pluto","Dover_Straits","Dover","Royal_Navy","Department_of_National_Defence_(Canada)","Department_of_National_Defence_(Canada)"]}
