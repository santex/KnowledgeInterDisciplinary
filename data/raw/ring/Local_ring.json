{"cursor":"12276","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In abstract algebra, more specifically ring theory, 'local rings' are certain\nrings that are comparatively simple, and serve to describe what is called\n\"local behaviour\", in the sense of functions defined on varieties or manifolds,\nor of algebraic number fields examined at a particular place, or prime. 'Local\nalgebra' is the branch of commutative algebra that studies local rings and\ntheir modules.\n\nIn practice, a commutative local ring often arises as the result of the\nlocalization of a ring at a prime ideal.\n\nThe concept of local rings was introduced by Wolfgang Krull in 1938 under the\nname Stellenringe. {{cite journal\n  | last = Krull first = Wolfgang authorlink = Wolfgang Krull title =\n  | Dimensionstheorie in Stellenringen journal = J.
