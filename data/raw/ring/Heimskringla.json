{"cursor":"12166","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Heimskringla' is the best known of the Old Norse kings' sagas. It was written\nin Old Norse in Iceland by the poet and historian Snorri Sturluson\n(1178/79â1241) ca. 1230. The name Heimskringla was first used in the 17th\ncentury, derived from the first two words of one of the manuscripts (kringla\nheimsins - the circle of the world).\n\nHeimskringla is a collection of sagas about the Norwegian kings, beginning with\nthe saga of the legendary Swedish dynasty of the Ynglings, followed by accounts\nof historical Norwegian rulers from Harald Fairhair of the 9th century up to\nthe death of the pretender Eystein Meyla in 1177. The exact sources of his work\nare disputed, but included earlier kings' sagas, such as Morkinskinna,\nFagrskinna and the twelfth century Norwegian synoptic histories and oral\ntraditions, notably many skaldic poems. Snorri had himself visited Norway and\nSweden. For events of mid-12th century, Snorri explicitly names the now lost\nwork [[Hryggjarstykki]] as his source. The composition of the sagas is\nSnorri's. The Heimskringla is referenced in the Jules Verne novel Journey to\nthe Centre of the Earth\n","linknr":253,"url":"Heimskringla","recorded":1362900109,"links":41,"instances":["travel_writer"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medieval literature","Sources of Norse mythology","Kings' sagas"],"headings":["Manuscript history","Translations","Scope","Contents","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/A_page_of_Heimskringla.jpg/220px-A_page_of_Heimskringla.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Ynglingesaga_1_Gerhard_Munthe.jpg/220px-Ynglingesaga_1_Gerhard_Munthe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["samuel_laing","travel_writer"]],"members":["samuel_laing"],"related":["Kings'_sagas","Old_Norse","Iceland","Snorri_Sturluson","Sagas","List_of_Norwegian_monarchs","Sweden","House_of_Yngling","Harald_I_of_Norway","Eystein_Meyla","Morkinskinna","Fagrskinna","Skald","Norway","Sweden","Jules_Verne","Journey_to_the_Centre_of_the_Earth","Bergen","Norway","Copenhagen","Ynglinga_Saga","Julius_Pokorny","Proto-Indo-European_language","Genitive_case","American_Heritage_Dictionary","Stockholm","Copenhagen_Fire_of_1728","National_and_University_Library_of_Iceland","Johan_Peringskiöld","Charles_XI_of_Sweden","Frederick_VI_of_Denmark","Samuel_Laing_(travel_writer)","Romantic_nationalism","Stortinget","Nynorsk","Bokmål","Odin","Asaland","Asgard","Scandinavia","Halfdan_the_Black","Magnus_V_of_Norway","Norway","Viking","Palestine","Sigurd_I_of_Norway","Olav_II_of_Norway","Harald_III_of_Norway","Constantinople","Syria","Sicily","England","Harold_Godwinson","Godwin,_Earl_of_Wessex","Battle_of_Stamford_Bridge","Battle_of_Hastings","England","Norse_mythology","Curt_Weibull","Lauritz_Weibull","Edvard_Bull,_Sr.","History_of_Stockholm","List_of_Norwegian_monarchs","Ynglinga_saga","Halfdan_the_Black","Harald_I_of_Norway","Haakon_I_of_Norway","Harald_II_of_Norway","Olaf_Tryggvason","Olav_II_of_Norway","Conversion_of_Dale-Gudbrand","Magnus_the_Good_","Harald_III_of_Norway","Olaf_III_of_Norway","Magnus_III_of_Norway","Sigurd_Jorsalfar","Magnus_IV_of_Norway","Harald_IV_of_Norway","Sigurd_Haraldson","Eystein_Haraldson","Inge_Haraldson","Hakon_II_of_Norway","Magnus_V_of_Norway"]}
