It was first described in 1980 by Andrew Wyllie at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh Medical School. {{cite journal\n| author = Wyllie AH date = 1980-04-10 title = Glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte\n| apoptosis is associated with endogenous endonuclease activation journal =\n| Nature volume = 284 issue = 5756 pages = 555â556 issn = 0028-0836 doi =\n| 10.1038/284555a0 pmid = 6245367 url =\n| http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v284/n5756/abs/284555a0.html\n}}\n\nDNA laddering is a distinctive feature of DNA degraded by caspase-activated\nDNase (CAD), which is a key event during apoptosis. CAD cleaves genomic DNA at\ninternucleosomal linker regions, resulting in DNA fragments that are multiples\nof 180â185 base-pairs in length. Separation of the fragments by agarose gel\nelectrophoresis and subsequent visualisation, for example by ethidium bromide\nstaining, results in a characteristic \"ladder\" pattern.\n\nWhile most of the morphological features of apoptotic cells are short-lived, DNA\nladdering can be used as final state read-out method and has therefore become a\nreliable method to distinguish apoptosis from necrosis.\n{{cite journal\n| author = Iwata M, Myerson D, Torok-Storb B, Zager RA. year = 1994 month =\n| December title = An evaluation of renal tubular DNA laddering in response to\n| oxygen deprivation and oxidant injury journal = Journal of the American\n| Society of Nephrology volume = 5 issue = 6 pages = 1307â1313 issn = 1046-6673\n| doi = pmid = 7893995 url =\n| http://jasn.asnjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/5/6/1307\n}}\n","linknr":133,"url":"DNA_laddering","recorded":1362481369,"links":15,"instances":["biology","journal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Apoptosis","Biological techniques and tools","Cell biology","Electrophoresis","Laboratory techniques","Programmed cell death"],"headings":["References","Further reading","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Apoptotic_DNA_Laddering.png/170px-Apoptotic_DNA_Laddering.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["nature","journal"],["morphology","biology"]],"members":["morphology","nature"],"related":["Ethidium_bromide","DNA_ladder","Scientific_control","DNA","Apoptotic_DNA_fragmentation","Gel_electrophoresis","Andrew_Wyllie","University_of_Edinburgh_Medical_School","Nature_(journal)","Caspase-activated_DNase","Apoptosis","Internucleosomal_linker","Base-pair","Agarose_gel_electrophoresis","Ethidium_bromide","Morphology_(biology)","Apoptosis","Necrosis","Journal_of_the_American_Society_of_Nephrology","Apoptotic_DNA_fragmentation","Caspase-activated_DNase","Nicoletti_assay","TUNEL_assay"]}
