The parse trees capture, and the prettyprinters regenerate, complete\ndetail about the original source program, including source position, comments,\nradix and format of numbers, etc., to ensure that regenerated source text is as\nrecognizable to a programmer as the original text modulo any applied\ntransformations.\n\nMany program analysis and transformation tools are limited to ASCII or Western\nEuropean character sets such as ISO-8859; DMS can handle these as well as UTF-8,\nUTF-16, EBCDIC, Shift-JIS and a variety of Microsoft character encodings.\n\nDMS uses GLR parsing technology, enabling it to handle all practical context-\nfree grammars. Semantic predicates extend this capability to interesting non-context-\nfree grammars (Fortran requires matching of multiple DO loops with shared\nCONTINUE statements by label; GLR with semantic predicates enables the DMS\nFortran parser to produce ASTs for correctly nested loops as it parses).\n\nDMS provides attribute grammar evaluators for computing custom analyses over\nASTs, such as metrics, and including special support for symbol table\nconstruction. Other program facts can be extracted by built-in control- and data-\nflow analysis engines, local and global pointer analysis, whole-program call\ngraph extraction, and symbolic range analysis by abstract interpretation.\n\nChanges to ASTs can be accomplished by both procedural methods coded in PARLANSE\nand source-to-source tree transformations coded as rewrite rules using surface-\nsyntax conditioned by any extracted program facts. The rewrite rule engine\nhandles associative and commutative rules. A rewrite rule for C to replace a\ncomplex condition by the '?:' operator be written as:\n\n   rule simplify_conditional_assignment(v:left_hand_side,e1:expression,e2:expre-\n   ssion,e3:expression) :statement->statement\n   =  \" if (\\e1) \\v=\\e2; else \\v=e3; \"\n   -> \" \\v=\\e1:?\\e2:\\e3; \" if no_side_effects(v);\n\nRewrite 'rule's have names, e.g. 'simplify_conditional_assignment'. Each rule\nhas a \"match this\" and \"replace by that\" pattern pair separated by '->', in our\nexample, on separate lines for readability. The patterns must correspond to\nlanguage syntax categories; in this case, both patterns must be of syntax\ncategory 'statement' also separated in sympathy with the patterns by '->'.\nTarget language (e.g., C) surface syntax is coded inside meta-quotes '\"', to\nseparate rewrite-rule syntax from that of the target language. Backslashes\ninside meta-quotes represent domain escapes, to indicate pattern meta variables\n(e.g., '\\v', '\\e1', '\\e2') that match any language construct corresponding to\nthe metavariable declaration in the signature line, e.g., 'e1' must be of\nsyntactic category: (any) expression. If a metavariable is mentioned multiple\ntimes in the match pattern, it must match to identical subtrees; the same\nidentically shaped 'v' must occur in both assignments in the match pattern in\nthis example. Metavariables in the replace pattern are replaced by the\ncorresponding matches from the left side. A conditional clause 'if' provides an\nadditional condition that must be met for the rule to apply, e.g., that the\nmatched metavariable 'v', being an arbitrary left-hand side, must not have a\nside effect (e.g., cannot be of the form of 'a[i++]'; the 'no_side_effects'\npredicate is defined by an analyzer built with other DMS mechanisms).\n\nAchieving a complex transformation on code is accomplished by providing a number\nof rules that cooperate to achieve the desired effect. The ruleset is focused on\nportions of the program by metaprograms coded in PARLANSE.\n\nA [http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/DMS/SimpleDMSDomainExample.html\ncomplete example] of a language definition and source-to-source transformation\nrules defined and applied is shown using high school algebra and a bit of\ncalculus as a domain-specific language.\n\nDMS has a variety of predefined language front ends, covering most real dialects\nof C and C++ including C++0x, C#, Java, Python, PHP, EGL, Fortran, COBOL, Visual\nBasic, Verilog, VHDL and some 20 or more other languages. Predefined languages\nenable customizers to immediately focus on their reengineering task rather than\non the details of the languages to be processed.\n\nDMS is additionally unusual in being implemented in a parallel programming\nlanguage, PARLANSE, that uses symmetric multiprocessors available on commodity\nworkstations. This enables DMS to provide faster answers for large system\nanalyses and conversions.\n\nDMS was originally motivated by a theory for maintaining designs of software\ncalled Design Maintenance\nSystems.
