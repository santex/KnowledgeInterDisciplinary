Frequent use of this chord is one of the defining\ncharacteristics of blues and barbershop harmony; barbershoppers refer to it as\n\"the barbershop seventh\". Since barbershop music tends to be sung in just\nintonation, the barbershop seventh chord may be accurately termed a harmonic\nseventh chord. The harmonic seventh chord is also widely used in \"blues\nflavored\" music. As guitars, pianos, and other equal-temperament instruments\ncannot play this chord, it is frequently approximated by a dominant seventh. As\na result it is often called a dominant seventh chord and written with the same\nsymbols (such as the blues progression I7 - V7 - IV7).\n\nAn often heard example of the harmonic seventh chord is the last word of the\nmodern addition to the song \"Happy Birthday to You\", with the lyrics, \"and\nmany more!\" The harmony on the word \"more\" is typically sung as a harmonic\nseventh chord.
