{"cursor":"5348","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Proportional division' or 'simple fair division' is the original and simplest\nproblem in fair division. Fair division problems are also called cake-cutting\nproblems. A proportional division of a cake between N people would\nensure each of them got at least 1/N of the cake by their own\nvaluation. The cake can have an irregular structure, for instance a fruit-cake\nwith icing, and the recipients may value the different parts differently. There\nis no requirement for a division to be envy-free.\n\nThere are two main types of solution studied: discrete procedures require one\nperson at a time to divide the resource, moving knife ones have one or more\nknives move over the resource and people can choose when to stop them.\n\nThe problem generalizes directly to other resources that can be split easily\nwithout losing value. The methods adapt easily to similar problems in chore\ndivision (dividing up an undesirable resource). Proportional division problems\nalso include dividing a resource where each recipient is entitled to a different\nproportion. Fair division of indivisible good is however a much harder problem.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Proportional_(fair_division)","recorded":1362556016,"links":10,"instances":["fair_division"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fair division","Game theory"],"headings":["Two players","Many players","Comparison with Envy-free division","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/9/8d9c307cb7f3c4a32822a51922d1ceaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/2/452ceee64d94ae0613dca3bcf3eb3322.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/8/878bd532f1718635c637124be801e4d9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/8/878bd532f1718635c637124be801e4d9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/8/8/388f554901ba5d77339eec8b26beebea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/d/0/dd0ad4a1d6ee82e0c27b352bafff7436.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/4/3/a438673491daae8148eae77373b6a467.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/5/5/455ab758683ee727a7169c95a80a7a31.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/3/8/938b9a2b494671180ae3e85714e9b745.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/8/878bd532f1718635c637124be801e4d9.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["entitlement","fair_division"]],"members":["entitlement"],"related":["Fair_division","Envy-free","Chore_division","Divide_and_choose","Entitlement_(fair_division)","Envy-free","Allocative_efficiency","Envy-free"]}
