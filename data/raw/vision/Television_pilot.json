{"cursor":"21896","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA \"'television pilot'\" (also known as a \"'pilot'\", \"'pilot episode'\", and\n\"'series premiere'\") is a standalone episode of a television series that is used\nto sell the show to a television network. At the time of its creation, the pilot\nis meant to be the \"testing ground\" to gauge if a series will be successful, and\nis therefore a test episode of an intended television series. It is an early\nstep in the development of a television series, much like pilot lights or pilot\nstudies serve as precursors to the start of larger activity, or pilot holes\nprepare the way for larger holes. Television networks use pilots to discover\nwhether an entertaining concept can be successfully realized. After seeing this\nsample of the proposed product, networks will then determine whether the expense\nof additional episodes is justified. They are best thought of as prototypes of\nthe show that is to follow, because elements often change from pilot to series.\n[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] estimates that only a little over a quarter of\nall pilots made for American television proceed to the series stage, [http:-\n//www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=slanguage_result&slang=busted+pilot&x=0&y=0\nVariety defines \"busted pilot\"] although the figure may be even lower. [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/P/htmlP/pilotprogram/pilotprogram.h-\ntm Plot programs at The Museum of Broadcast Communications]\n\nMost pilots are never publicly screened if they fail to sell a series. If a\nseries eventuates, pilots are usually - but not always - broadcast as the\nintroductory episode of the series.\n","linknr":310,"url":"Television_pilot","recorded":1362576261,"links":39,"instances":["short_film","actor","the_bionic_woman","experiment","journalist","media"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Television terminology","Television pilots|"],"headings":["Pilot season","Types of pilot","As distinguished from \"first episode\"","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pilot","experiment"],["mike_wallace","journalist"],["craig_stevens","actor"],["spin-off","media"],["the_spirit_of_christmas","short_film"],["jaime_sommers","the_bionic_woman"]],"members":["the_spirit_of_christmas","craig_stevens","jaime_sommers","pilot","mike_wallace"],"related":["Episode","Television_series","Pilot_light","Pilot_(experiment)","Pilot_hole","Television_network","Prototype","American_television","List_of_United_States_over-the-air_television_networks","American_Broadcasting_Company","CBS","The_CW_Television_Network","Fox_Broadcasting_Company","NBC","Elevator_pitch","Ellie_Kanner","Warner_Bros._Television","Upfront","Television_program","Television_commercial","Mike_Wallace_(journalist)","Bud_Collyer","CBS","Jackie_Cooper","Craig_Stevens_(actor)","Post-production","Spin-off_(media)","Lisa_Bonet","Pat_Harrington,_Jr.","Lifetime_Network","Brigid_Brannagh","Valley_Girls","Prequel","Brittany_Snow","Lily_van_der_Woodsen","Anthology_series","Television_movie","TV_miniseries","The_Spirit_of_Christmas_(short_film)","University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder","Fox_Broadcasting_Company","Seth_MacFarlane","Rhode_Island_School_of_Design","Jaime_Sommers_(The_Bionic_Woman)","Sarah_Jane_Smith","Cartoon_Network","Invasion_of_the_Bane","BBC","Erin_Moran","Garry_Marshall","Channel_101","Channel_101_NY"]}
