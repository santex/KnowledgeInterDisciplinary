It first broadcast on 29 September 1986 on RTÃ1, before\nmoving to Network 2 in September 1988. The strand began to diversify throughout\nthe late 1990s and the 2000s. It was also known as 'Dempsey's Den', 'Den TV' and\n'Den2' at different times during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.\n\nIn mid-2010, RTÃ Television announced an overhaul of all young people's\nprogramming, especially as Ireland moves towards digital terrestrial television\nin autumn 2010. This overhaul took place on September 20, 2010\neffectively replacing The Den branding and to incorporate two new strands,\n[[RTÃjr]] and [[TRTÃ]].\n","linknr":635,"url":"The_Den_(television)","recorded":1362904182,"links":19,"instances":["irish_politician","tv_series","broadcaster","tv_series","tv_series","region","presenter","presenter","puppets","tv_series"],"pdf":["http://www.rte.ie/tv/newseason/newseason2010.pdf","http://www.rte.ie/tv/newseason/newseason2010.pdf","http://www.rte.ie/tv/newseason/newseason2010.pdf"],"categories":["1986
