A\ntotal of such planets (in planetary systems, including multiple planetary\nsystems) have been identified as of . The Kepler\nmission has detected over 18,000 additional candidates, including potentially\n262 habitable ones.

Middour, Anima Sabale, Akm Kamal Uddin,\nBill Wohler, Thomas Barclay, Martin Still In the Milky Way galaxy, it is expected that there are many billions of\nplanets (at least one planet, on average, orbiting around each star, resulting\nin 100â400 billion exoplanets), with\nmany more free-floating planetary-mass bodies orbiting the galaxy\ndirectly.

Blandford; estimates 700\nobjects >10 â6 Solar masses (âa Mars mass) per main sequence star\nbetween 0.08 and 1 Solar mass, of which there are billions in the Milky\nWay. The nearest known exoplanet is Alpha Centauri Bb. Almost all of the\nplanets detected so far are within our home galaxy the Milky Way; however, there\nhave been a small number of possible detections of extragalactic planets.\nAstronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) reported in\nJanuary 2013, that \"at least 17 billion\" Earth-sized exoplanets are estimated to\nreside in the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nFor centuries, many philosophers and scientists supposed that extrasolar planets\nexisted, but there was no way of knowing how common they were or how similar\nthey might be to the planets of the Solar System. Various detection claims,\nstarting in the nineteenth century, were all eventually rejected by astronomers.\nThe first confirmed detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-\nmass planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first\nconfirmed detection of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star was made in\n1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star\n51 Pegasi. Due to improved observational techniques, the rate of detections has\nincreased rapidly since then. Some exoplanets have\nbeen directly imaged by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected\nthrough indirect methods such as radial velocity measurements. Besides exoplanets, \"exocomets\", comets beyond our solar\nsystem, have also been detected and may be common in the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nMost known exoplanets are giant planets believed to resemble Jupiter or\nNeptune, but this reflects a sampling bias, as massive planets are more easily\nobserved. http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0603/0603200.pdf Some\nrelatively lightweight exoplanets, only a few times more massive than Earth\n(now known by the term Super-Earth), are known as well; statistical studies\nnow indicate that they actually outnumber giant planets while recent discoveries have included Earth-sized\nand smaller planets and a handful that appear to exhibit other Earth-like\nproperties. There also exist planetary-\nmass objects that orbit brown dwarfs and other bodies that \"float free\" in\nspace not bound to any star; however, the term \"planet\" is not always applied\nto these objects.\n\nThe discovery of extrasolar planets, particularly those that orbit in the\nhabitable zone where it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface\n(and therefore also life), has intensified interest in the search for\nextraterrestrial life. {{cite web |title=Terrestrial Planet Finder science\ngoals: Detecting signs of life |work=Terrestrial Planet Finder\n|publisher=JPL/NASA |url=http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_signsOfLife.cfm\n|accessdate=2006-07-21 }} Thus, the search for extrasolar planets also\nincludes the study of planetary habitability, which considers a wide range of\nfactors in determining an extrasolar planet's suitability for hosting life.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, astronomers from the Kepler Mission space observatory\nannounced the discovery of KOI-172.02, an Earth-like exoplanet candidate\norbiting a star similar to our Sun in the habitable zone and possibly a \"prime\ncandidate to host alien life\".\n","linknr":1522,"url":"Exoplanet","recorded":1362371891,"links":118,"instances":["moon","spacecraft","spacecraft","esa","spacecraft","journal","planet","spacecraft","spacecraft","astronomy","astronomer","star","amateur_extrasolar_planet_search_project"],"pdf":["http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0603/0603200.pdf","http://www.shpltd.co.uk/jha.pdf","http://www.shpltd.co.uk/jha.pdf","http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA/GAIA/docs/DPAC/web/DPAC_NL_015.pdf","http://www.rssd.esa.int/SA/GAIA/docs/DPAC/web/DPAC_NL_015.pdf","http://www.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwa/memo/lwa0013.pdf","http://www.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwa/memo/lwa0013.pdf"],"categories":["Search
