Usually they must be\nlarger than 1 micrometer. Chemistry: Matter and Its Changes, 4th Ed. by\nBrady, Senese, ISBN 0-471-21517-1 The internal phase (solid) is dispersed\nthroughout the external phase (fluid) through mechanical agitation, with the use\nof certain excipients or suspending agents. Unlike colloids, suspensions will\neventually settle. An example of a suspension would be sand in water. The\nsuspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if\nleft undisturbed. This distinguishes a suspension from a colloid, in which the\nsuspended particles are smaller and do not settle. The Columbia Electronic\nEncyclopedia, 6th ed. Colloids and suspensions are different from\nsolutions, in which the dissolved substance (solute) does not exist as a solid,\nand solvent and solute are homogeneously mixed.\n\nA suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called\nan aerosol or particulate. In the atmosphere these consist of fine dust and\nsoot particles, sea salt, biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates, nitrates, and\ncloud droplets.\n\nSuspensions are classified on the basis of the dispersed phase and the\ndispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid while the latter may\neither be a solid, a liquid, or a gas.\n\nIn modern chemical process industries, high shear mixing technology has been\nused to create many novel suspensions.\n\nSuspensions are unstable from the thermodynamic point of view; however, they can\nbe kinetically stable over a large period of time, which determines their shelf\nlife. This time span needs to be measured to ensure the best product quality to\nthe final consumer. âDispersion stability refers to the ability of a dispersion\nto resist change in its properties over time.â D.J.
