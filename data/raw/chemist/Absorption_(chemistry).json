For the\nabsorption of light, see [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)]].\n\n\n\nIn chemistry, 'absorption' is a physical or chemical phenomenon or a process in\nwhich atoms, molecules, or ions enter some bulk phase â gas, liquid, or solid\nmaterial. This is a different process from adsorption, since molecules\nundergoing absorption are taken up by the volume, not by the surface (as in the\ncase for adsorption). A more general term is [[sorption]], which covers\nabsorption, adsorption, and ion exchange. Absorption is a condition in which\nsomething takes in another substance.\n\nIf absorption is a physical process not accompanied by any other physical or\nchemical process, it usually follows the 'Nernst partition law':\n:\"the ratio of concentrations of some solute species in two bulk phases in\n:contact is constant for a given solute and bulk phases\":\n:: \\frac{[x]_{1}}{[x]_{2}} = \\text{constant} = K_{N(x,12)}\n\nThe value of constant K N depends on temperature and is called\n'partition coefficient'. This equation is valid if concentrations are not too\nlarge and if the species \"x\" does not change its form in any of the two phases\n\"1\" or \"2\". If such molecule undergoes association or dissociation then this\nequation still describes the equilibrium between \"x\" in both phases, but only\nfor the same form â concentrations of all remaining forms must be calculated by\ntaking into account all the other equilibria.\n\nIn the case of gas absorption, one may calculate its concentration by using,\ne.g., the Ideal gas law, c = p/RT. In alternative fashion, one may use partial\npressures instead of concentrations.\n\nIn many processes important in technology, the chemical absorption is used in\nplace of the physical process, e.g., absorption of carbon dioxide by sodium\nhydroxide â such acid-base processes do not follow the Nernst partition law.\n\nFor some examples of this effect, see liquid-liquid extraction. It is possible\nto extract from one liquid phase to another a solute without a chemical\nreaction. Examples of such solutes are noble gases and osmium tetroxide. {{cite book|last = McMurry|first = John|title = Fundamentals of\nOrganic Chemistry |edition = Fifth|publisher = Agnus McDonald|year = 2003 |pages\n= 409|isbn = 0-534-39573-2}}\n\nThe process of absorption means that a substance captures and transforms\nenergy. The absorbent distributes the material it captures throughout while and\nadsorbent only distributes it through the surface. The reddish color of copper\nis an example of this process because it is caused due to its absorption of\nblue light. Senese, F. (1997-2010) General Chemistry Online.
