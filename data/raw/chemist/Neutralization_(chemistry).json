{"cursor":"12132","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" and hydrochloric acid. Indicator agent bromothymol blue.]] In chemistry,\n 'neutralization' (or 'neutralisation', see spelling differences) is a chemical\n reaction in which an acid and a base react to form a salt. Water is frequently,\n but not necessarily, produced as well. Neutralizations with Arrhenius acids and\n bases always produce water where acidâalkali reactions produce water and a\n metal salt.\n\nOften, neutralization reactions are exothermic (the enthalpy of neutralization).\nFor example, the reaction of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. However,\nthere is also [[endothermic]] neutralization, an example is the reaction between\nsodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and acetic acid (vinegar).\n\nNeutralization reactions do not necessarily imply a resultant pH of 7. The resultant pH will vary based on the strength of the acid\nand base reactants.\n","linknr":196,"url":"Neutralization_(chemistry)","recorded":1362485648,"links":41,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","unit","chemistry","molecule"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Acid-base chemistry","Chemical reactions","Water treatment"],"headings":["Arrhenius acids and bases","Acid-alkali","Non-aqueous reactions","Resultant pH","Calculations","Applications","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Neutralization_reaction_between_sodium_hydroxide_and_hydrochloric_acid.jpg/220px-Neutralization_reaction_between_sodium_hydroxide_and_hydrochloric_acid.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["american_and_british_english_spelling_differences#-ise,_-ize","-isation,_-ization"],["base","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"],["water","molecule"],["hydron","chemistry"],["mole","unit"]],"members":["salt","base","mole","hydron","water"],"related":["Hydrochloric_acid","Chemical_reaction","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Salt_(chemistry)","Water","Salt_(chemistry)","Exothermic","Sodium_hydroxide","Hydrochloric_acid","Sodium_Bicarbonate","Acetic_acid","Cation","Anion","Sodium_hydroxide","Hydrochloric_acid","Sodium","Chlorine","Table_salt","Net_ionic_equation","Hydronium_ion","Alkali","Salt_(chemistry)","Hydroxide","Water_(molecule)","Spectator_ion","Hydron_(chemistry)","Alkali_metal","Alkaline_earth_metal","Sodium_hydroxide","Potassium_hydroxide","Magnesium_hydroxide","Calcium_hydroxide","Brønsted-Lowry_acid-base_theory","Mole_(unit)","Titration","Concentration","PH_meter","PH_indicator","Stoichiometric","Molarity","Water_treatment","Calcium_carbonate","Calcium_oxide","Magnesium_hydroxide","Sodium_bicarbonate","Gastric_acid","Hydrochloric_acid","Sodium_bicarbonate","Ammonium_sulfate","Ammonium_nitrate","Sulfur_dioxide","Calcium_sulfite"]}
