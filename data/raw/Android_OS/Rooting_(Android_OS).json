On Android, rooting can also\nfacilitate the complete removal and replacement of the device's operating\nsystem, usually with a more recent release of its current operating system.\n\nAs Android was derived from the Linux kernel, rooting an Android device is\nsimilar in practice to accessing administrative permissions on Linux or any\nother Unix-like operating system such as FreeBSD or OS X.\n","linknr":753,"url":"Rooting_(Android_OS)","recorded":1362551616,"links":30,"instances":["unix","operating_system","computer_security","variable","operating_system"],"pdf":["http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/2012-26308_PI.pdf","http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2012/2012-26308_PI.pdf"],"categories":["Android (operating system)","Hardware restrictions"],"headings":["Reasons for rooting","\"Rooting\" vis-Ã -vis \"jailbreaking\"","Description","Process","Industry reaction","Legality","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Nexus_4.png/180px-Nexus_4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Android_robot.svg/60px-Android_robot.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/XO_Motherboard.png/100px-XO_Motherboard.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["android","operating_system"],["exploit","computer_security"],["su","unix"],["path","variable"],["android","operating_system"],["replicant","operating_system"]],"members":["su","replicant","exploit","path","android"],"related":["Google_Nexus","Smartphone","Tablet_computer","Android_(operating_system)","Mobile_operating_system","Privilege_escalation","Superuser","Mobile_network_operator","Application_software","Linux_kernel","Linux","Unix-like","FreeBSD","OS_X","Mobile_network_operator","Application_software","IOS_jailbreaking","IOS","Sideloading","Bootloader","IOS_jailbreaking","Sideloading","Android_Debug_Bridge","Telephone_company","AT&T_Mobility","Firmware","Samsung_Infuse_4G","Kindle_Fire","Google_Play","Exploit_(computer_security)","Su_(Unix)","Executable","PATH_(variable)","Chmod","HTC_Dream","Digital_signature","Google_Nexus","Nexus_One","Nexus_S","Galaxy_Nexus","Nexus_4","Nexus_7","Nexus_10","Fastboot","Motorola","LG_Electronics","HTC","Droid_X","Samsung_Galaxy_S_II","CyanogenMod","Tethering","Bootloader","Barnes_&_Noble","Amazon.com","Over-the-air_programming","Nook_Tablet","Kindle_Fire","Sideloading","Modding","CyanogenMod","HTC","Samsung","Motorola","Sony_Ericsson","Bootloader","Google_Nexus","HTC","Free_Software_Foundation_Europe","United_States_Copyright_Office","SIM_lock","Android_(operating_system)","Android_Dev_Phone","CyanogenMod","Fastboot","Google_Nexus","Hacking_of_consumer_electronics","IOS_jailbreaking","Replicant_(operating_system)","RootzWiki","SIM_lock","Superuser","Ubuntu_for_Android"]}
