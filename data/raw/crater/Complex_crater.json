The collapse of the\ntransient cavity is driven by gravity, and involves both the uplift of the\ncentral region and the inward collapse of the rim. The central uplift is not the\nresult of elastic rebound which is a process in which a material with elastic\nstrength attempts to return to its original geometry; rather the uplift is a\nprocess in which a material with little or no strength attempts to return to a\nstate of gravitational equilibrium. {{cite book\n  | last = French first = Bevan M title = Traces of Catastrophe: A Handbook of\n  | Shock-Metamorphic Effects in Terrestrial Meteorite Impact Structures\n  | publisher = Lunar and Planetary Institute year = 1998 location = Houston,\n  | Texas pages = 120 url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/CB-\n  | 954.intro.html id = LPI Contribution No. 954\n}}\n\nComplex craters have uplifted centers, and they have typically broad flat\nshallow crater floors, and terraced walls. At the largest sizes, one or more\nexterior or interior rings may appear, and the structure may be labeled an\nimpact basin rather than an impact crater. Complex-crater morphology on rocky\nplanets appears to follow a regular sequence with increasing size: small complex\ncraters with a central topographic peak are called central peak craters, for\nexample Tycho; intermediate-sized craters, in which the central peak is replaced\nby a ring of peaks, are called peak-ring craters, for example SchrÃ¶dinger; and\nthe largest craters contain multiple concentric topographic rings, and are\ncalled multi-ringed basins, for example Orientale. On icy as opposed to rocky\nbodies, other morphological forms appear which may have central pits rather than\ncentral peaks, and at the largest sizes may contain very many concentric rings â\nValhalla on Callisto is the type example of the latter.\n","linknr":223,"url":"Complex_crater","recorded":1362372535,"links":17,"instances":["crater","crater","crater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Impact craters","Impact geology"],"headings":["References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Craterstructure.gif/250px-Craterstructure.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/LRO_WAC_Tycho_crater_mosaic.jpg/250px-LRO_WAC_Tycho_crater_mosaic.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Craterstructure.gif/120px-Craterstructure.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Collision_d%27une_com%C3%A8te.jpg/120px-Collision_d%27une_com%C3%A8te.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tycho","crater"],["schrodinger","crater"],["valhalla","crater"]],"members":["schrodinger","tycho","valhalla"],"related":["Impact_crater","Lunar_and_Planetary_Institute","Houston","Texas","Tycho_(crater)","Schrodinger_(crater)","Mare_orientale","Valhalla_(crater)","Impact_structure","Traces_of_Catastrophe","Lunar_and_Planetary_Institute"]}
