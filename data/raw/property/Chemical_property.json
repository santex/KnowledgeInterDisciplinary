William L. Masterton, Cecile N.\nHurley, \"Chemistry: Principles and Reactions\", 6th edition. Brooks/Cole Cengage\nLearning, 2009, p.13 [http://books.google.com/books?id=teubNK-\nb2bsC&pg=PT39&dq=properties+of+matter+%22chemical+property%22&hl=en&ei=u8FdTd-\nwGYT48AaWs_DuCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepag-\ne&q=properties%20of%20matter%20%22chemical%20property%22&f=false (Google\nbooks)] Simply speaking, chemical properties cannot be determined just by\nviewing or touching the substance; the substance's internal structure must be\naffected for its chemical properties to be investigated. However a catalytic\nproperty would also be a chemical property.\n\nChemical properties can be contrasted with physical properties, which can be\ndiscerned without changing the substance's structure. However, for many\nproperties within the scope of physical chemistry, and other disciplines at the\nboundary between chemistry and physics, the distinction may be a matter of\nresearcher's perspective. Material properties, both physical and chemical, can\nbe viewed as supervenient; i.e., secondary to the underlying reality. Several\nlayers of superveniency are possible.\n\nChemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications. They can\nalso be useful to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from\nother substances. Materials science will normally consider the chemical\nproperties of a substance to guide its applications.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Chemical_property","recorded":1362507986,"links":32,"instances":["cognitive"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties|*"],"headings":["Examples of chemical properties","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["perspective","cognitive"]],"members":["perspective"],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Chemical_substance","Chemical_structure","Catalysis","Physical_properties","Physical_chemistry","Chemistry","Physics","Perspective_(cognitive)","Material_properties","Supervenient","Chemical_classification","Materials_science","Heat_of_combustion","Enthalpy_of_formation","Toxicity","Chemical_stability","Flammability","Oxidation_state","Coordination_number","Physical_property","Chemical_structure","Material_properties","Biological_activity","Quantitative_structureâ€“activity_relationship","Lipinski's_Rule_of_Five","Chemicalize.org"]}
