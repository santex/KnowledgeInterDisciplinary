Unit operations involve bringing a\nphysical change such as separation, crystallization, evaporation, filtration\netc. For example, in milk processing, homogenization, pasteurization, chilling,\nand packaging are each unit operations which are connected to create the overall\nprocess. A process may have many unit operations to obtain the desired product.\n\nHistorically, the different chemical industries were regarded as different\nindustrial processes and with different principles. Arthur Dehon Little\npropounded the concept of \"unit operations\" to explain industrial chemistry\nprocesses in 1916. \"The MIT Connection\"http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/adlittle/mit-\nconnection.html Retrieved March 6, 2010. In 1923, William H.Walker, Warren\nK. Lewis and William H. McAdams wrote the book The Principles of Chemical\nEngineering The Encyclopedia of Earth. \"Walker, William H.\nhttp://www.eoearth.org/article/Walker,_William_H.

They summed-up these similar processes into unit operations.\nEach unit operation follows the same physical laws and may be used in all\nchemical industries. The unit operations form the fundamental principles of\nchemical engineering.\n\nChemical engineering unit operations consist of five classes: #Fluid flow\nprocesses, including fluids transportation, filtration, solids fluidization\n#Heat transfer processes, including evaporation, condensation #Mass transfer\nprocesses, including gas absorption, distillation, extraction, adsorption,\ndrying #Thermodynamic processes, including gas liquefaction, refrigeration\n#Mechanical processes, including solids transportation, crushing and\npulverization, screening and sieving\n\nChemical engineering unit operations also fall in the following categories:\n* Combination (mixing)\n* Separation (distillation)\n* Reaction (chemical reaction)\n\nChemical engineering unit operations and chemical engineering unit processing\nform the main principles of all kinds of chemical industries and are the\nfoundation of designs of chemical plants, factories, and equipment used.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Unit_operation","recorded":1362570500,"links":30,"instances":["chemistry","process_engineering","engineering"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical engineering","Unit operations|*"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/LOC_MI0086_QuincyMine_TIF_00027aS.png/400px-LOC_MI0086_QuincyMine_TIF_00027aS.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/PlatformHolly.jpg/170px-PlatformHolly.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["process","engineering"],["homogenization","chemistry"],["mixing","process_engineering"]],"members":["homogenization","mixing","process"],"related":["Hancock,_MI","Chemical_engineering","Process_(engineering)","Homogenization_(chemistry)","Pasteurization","Packaging","Arthur_Dehon_Little","William_Hultz_Walker","Warren_K._Lewis","William_H._McAdams","Fluids_transportation","Filtration","Solids_fluidization","Heat_transfer","Evaporation","Condensation","Mass_transfer","Gas_absorption","Distillation","Resource_extraction","Adsorption","Drying","Gas_liquefaction","Refrigeration","Solids_transportation","Crusher","Screening_and_sieving","Mixing_(process_engineering)","Distillation","Chemical_reaction","Unit_processing","Distillation_Design","Separation_process","Transport_phenomena","Process_simulation"]}
