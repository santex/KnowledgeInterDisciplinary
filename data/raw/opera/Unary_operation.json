{"cursor":"3563","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'unary operation' is an operation with only one operand, i.e.\na single input. Specifically, it is a function\n: f:\\ A\\to A\nwhere A is a set. In this case f is called a unary operation on A.\n\nCommon notations are prefix notation (e.g. +, â, not), postfix notation (e.g.\nfactorial n!), functional notation (e.g. sin x or sin (x)), and superscripts\n(e.g. transpose A T). Other notations exist as well. For example, in\nthe case of the square root, a horizontal bar extending the square root sign\nover the argument can indicate the extent of the argument.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Unary_operation","recorded":1362374531,"links":35,"instances":["programming","programming_language","computer_science","computing","mathematics","programming","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary algebra","Operators (programming)"],"headings":["Unary negative and positive","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/1/5/b15c18104ff9f540eeae0fb865bfa925.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["operation","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["c","programming_language"],["reference","computer_science"],["execution","computing"],["scope","programming"],["operation","mathematics"],["operator","programming"]],"members":["operator","c","reference","execution","operation","scope","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Operation_(mathematics)","Operand","Set_(mathematics)","Prefix_notation","Postfix_notation","Factorial","Superscript","Transpose","Square_root","C_(programming_language)","Reference_(computer_science)","Indirection","Signed_number_representations","Negation","Type_conversion","Execution_(computing)","Scope_(programming)","Binary_operation","Ternary_operation","Arity","Operation_(mathematics)","Operator_(programming)"]}
