There is still disagreement on the subject of the\nclassification, ancestry, and progeny of H. ergaster, but it is now widely\naccepted to be the direct ancestor of later hominids such as [[Homo\nheidelbergensis]], [[Homo sapiens]], and [[Homo neanderthalensis]] and Asian\n[[Homo erectus]].\n\nIt is one of the earliest members of the genus [[Homo]], possibly ancestral to,\nor sharing a common ancestor with, [[Homo erectus]]. Some\npaleoanthropologists consider H. ergaster to be simply the African variety of H.\nerectus; this leads to the use of the term \"Homo erectus [[sensu stricto]]\" for\nthe Asian H. Erectus, and \"Homo erectus [[sensu lato]]\" for the larger species\ncomprising both the early African populations (H. ergaster) and the Asian\npopulations. AntÃ³n, S. C. (2003), Natural history of Homo erectus. Am. J.\nPhys. Anthropol., 122: 126â170. doi: 10.1002/ajpa.10399 \"By the 1980s, the\ngrowing numbers of H. erectus specimens, particularly in Africa, led to the\nrealization that Asian H. erectus (H. erectus sensu stricto), once thought so\nprimitive, was in fact more derived than its African counterparts. These\nmorphological differences were interpreted by some as evidence that more than\none species might be included in H. erectus sensu lato (e.g., Stringer, 1984;\nAndrews, 1984; Tattersall, 1986; Wood, 1984, 1991a, b; Schwartz and Tattersall,\n2000).\" ... \"Unlike the European lineage, in my opinion, the taxonomic issues\nsurrounding Asian vs. African H. erectus are more intractable. The issue was\nmost pointedly addressed with the naming of H. ergaster on the basis of the type\nmandible KNM-ER 992, but also including the partial skeleton and isolated teeth\nof KNM-ER 803 among other Koobi Fora remains (Groves and Mazak, 1975). Recently,\nthis specific name was applied to most early African and Georgian H. erectus in\nrecognition of the less-derived nature of these remains vis Ã  vis conditions in\nAsian H. erectus (see Wood, 1991a, p. 268; Gabunia et al., 2000a). It should be\nnoted, however, that at least portions of the paratype of H. ergaster (e.g., KNM-\nER 1805) are not included in most current conceptions of that taxon. The H.\nergaster question remains famously unresolved (e.g., Stringer, 1984; Tattersall,\n1986; Wood, 1991a, 1994; Rightmire, 1998b; Gabunia et al., 2000a; Schwartz and\nTattersall, 2000), in no small part because the original diagnosis provided no\ncomparison with the Asian fossil record.\"\n\nThe binomial name was published in 1975 by Groves and MazÃ¡k. The second part,\n\"ergaster\", is derived from the Ancient Greek \"workman\", in reference to the\ncomparatively advanced lithic technology developed by the species, introducing\nthe Acheulean industry.\n","linknr":519,"url":"Homo_ergaster","recorded":1362373292,"links":56,"instances":["country","anthropologist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Early species of Homo","Lower Paleolithic","Pliocene primates","Pleistocene primates","Pleistocene extinctions","Fossil taxa described in 1975","Prehistoric mammals of Africa","Prehistoric Kenya"],"headings":["Discovery and representative fossils","Classification and special distinction","Divergence","Use of tools","Sociality","See also","Footnotes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Homo_ergaster.jpg/230px-Homo_ergaster.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Homo_ergaster2.jpg/250px-Homo_ergaster2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["alan_walker","anthropologist"],["georgia","country"],["georgia","country"]],"members":["georgia","alan_walker"],"related":["Pleistocene","Animalia","Chordata","Mammal","Primates","Hominid","Colin_Groves","Vratislav_Mazák","Chronospecies","Pleistocene_epoch","Colin_Groves","Vratislav_Mazák","Lithic_technology","Acheulean","South_Africa","Paleontologist","John_T._Robinson","Colin_Groves","Vratislav_Mazák","KNM_ER_992","Kenya","Type_specimen","Turkana_Boy","Paleoanthropologist","Kamoya_Kimeu","Alan_Walker_(anthropologist)","Paleoanthropologist","Asia","Turkana_Boy","Peking_Man","Asia","Supraorbital_foramen","Sexual_dimorphism","Cranial_capacity","Biological_specimen","Tanzania","Ethiopia","Kenya","South_Africa","San_Diego,_California","Taxon","Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans","Homo_georgicus","Georgia_(country)","Punctuated_equilibrium","Africa","Stone_tool","Oldowan","Acheulean","Hunter-gatherer","Hominid","Cervical_vertebrae","Dmanisi","Georgia_(country)","Paleolithic_art","List_of_fossil_sites","List_of_human_evolution_fossils"]}
