{"cursor":"9175","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Syngas', or 'synthesis gas', is a fuel gas mixture consisting primarily of\nhydrogen, carbon monoxide, and very often some carbon dioxide. The name comes\nfrom its use as intermediates in creating synthetic natural gas\n(SNG) Beychok, M.R., Process and environmental technology for producing SNG\nand liquid fuels, U.S. EPA report EPA-660/2-75-011, May 1975 and for\nproducing ammonia or methanol. Syngas is also used as an intermediate in\nproducing synthetic petroleum for use as a fuel or lubricant via the\nFischerâTropsch process and previously the Mobil methanol to gasoline process.\nSyngas is combustible and often used as a fuel of internal combustion engines [http://www.clarke-energy.com/gas-type/synthesis-gas-\nsyngas/ Syngas in Gas Engines], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 15.11.11 [http://www.dailytech.com/Why+Let+it+go+to+Waste++Enerkem+Leaps+Ahead+With+-\nTrashtoGas+Plans/article17817.htm Syngas used in IC engines] [http://-\nwww.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00102200801963417 Syngas used in IC engines\n2] . It has less than half the energy density of natural gas.\n\nProduction methods include steam reforming of natural gas or liquid hydrocarbons\nto produce hydrogen, the gasification of coal, Beychok, M.R., Coal\ngasification and the Phenosolvan process, American Chemical Society 168th\nNational Meeting, Atlantic City, September 1974 biomass, and in some types\nof waste-to-energy gasification facilities.\n","linknr":308,"url":"Syngas","recorded":1362509560,"links":40,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.sandia.gov/mission/ste/stories/2008/August/Millerfinal.pdf","http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/S2P_SAND2009-5796P.pdf","http://www.swri.org/utsr/summaries/FellowOluyedeSUM.pdf","http://www.swri.org/utsr/summaries/FellowOluyedeSUM.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical engineering","Coal technology","Fuel gas","Waste treatment technology","Synthetic fuels"],"headings":["Production chemistry","Alternative technologies","Post-treatment","Energy capacity","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Gas_flame.jpg/90px-Gas_flame.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Fuel_gas","Hydrogen","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_dioxide","Synthetic_natural_gas","Ammonia","Methanol","Synfuel","Fuel","Lubricant","Fischer–Tropsch_process","Mobil","Methanol_to_gasoline","Internal_combustion_engine","Natural_gas","Steam_reforming","Natural_gas","Hydrogen","Gasification","Biomass","Waste-to-energy","Steam_reforming","Water_gas","Exothermic_reaction","Ammonia","Natural_gas","Steam_reforming","Methane","Water","Carbon_monoxide","Hydrogen","Water_gas_shift","Carbon_monoxide","Water","Carbon_dioxide","Hydrogen","Pressure_swing_adsorption","Amine_scrubbing","Membrane_reactor","Dutch_Institute_For_Fundamental_Energy_Research","Sunshine-to-Petrol_project","Counter-Rotating_Ring_Receiver_Reactor_Recuperator","Illuminating_gas","Gas_lighting","Electric_light","Natural_gas","Fischer–Tropsch_process","Methane","Methanol","Dimethyl_ether","Catalytic","Carbon_monoxide","Nitrogen","Carbon_monoxide","Nitrogen","Carbon_monoxide","Complexation","Decomplexation","Carbon_monoxide","Toluene","Carbon_monoxide","Carbon_dioxide","Nitrogen","Methane","Ethane","Hydrogen","Pressure_swing_adsorption","Hydrogen","Carbon_monoxide","Net_energy_gain","Ammonia","Biochar","Biobased_economy","Boudouard_reaction","Carbon_monoxide","Dimethyl_ether","Integrated_gasification_combined_cycle","Methanol","Partial_oxidation","Reformer_sponge_iron_cycle","Syngas_fermentation","Underground_coal_gasification"]}
