[http://www.eia.gov/energy_in_brief/about_shale_gas.cfm U.S.\nEnergy Information Administration] Shale gas has become an increasingly\nimportant source of natural gas in the United States since the start of this\ncentury, and interest has spread to potential gas shales in the rest of the\nworld. In 2000 shale gas provided only 1% of U.S. natural gas production; by\n2010 it was over 20% and the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration\npredicts that by 2035, 46% of the United States' natural gas supply will come\nfrom shale gas.\n\nSome analysts expect that shale gas will greatly expand worldwide energy\nsupply.
