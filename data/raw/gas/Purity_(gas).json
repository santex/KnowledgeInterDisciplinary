A\nhigh purity refers to a low amount of other gases. Gases of higher purity are\nconsidered to be of better quality and are usually more expensive.\n\nThe purity of gas can be expressed as a percentage value or as a decimal\nfraction. The decimal fraction is an abbreviation of the percentage value, where\nthe first digit represents the number of nines in the percentage value and the\nlast digit represents the last digit of the percentage value. For example, a\npurity of 99.97% can be abbreviated as purity 3.7 and a purity of 99.9999% is\nthe same as purity 6.0.\n","linknr":90,"url":"Purity_(gas)","recorded":1362672228,"links":17,"instances":["mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Gases"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Science.jpg/30px-Science.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fraction","mathematics"]],"members":["fraction"],"related":["Percentage","Fraction_(mathematics)","Numerical_digit"]}
