{"cursor":"13251","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn the United States, a 'group purchasing organization (GPO)' is an entity that\nis created to leverage the purchasing power of a group of businesses to obtain\ndiscounts from vendors based on the collective buying power of the GPO members.\n\nMany GPOs are funded by administrative fees that are paid by the vendors that\nGPOs oversee. Some GPOs are funded by fees paid by the buying members. Some GPOs\nare funded by a combination of both of these methods. These fees can be set as a\npercentage of the purchase or set as an annual flat rate. Some GPOs set\nmandatory participation levels for their members, while others are completely\nvoluntary. Members participate based on their purchasing needs and their level\nof confidence in what should be competitive pricing negotiated by their GPOs.\n\nGroup purchasing is used in many industries to purchase raw materials and\nsupplies, but it is common practice in the grocery industry, health care,\nelectronics, industrial manufacturing and agricultural industries. In recent\nyears, group purchasing has begun to take root in the nonprofit community. Group\npurchasing amongst nonprofits is still relatively new, but is quickly becoming\ncommon place as nonprofits aim to find ways to reduce overhead expenses. In the\nhealthcare field, GPOs have most commonly been accessed by acute-care\norganizations, but non-profit Community Clinics and Health Centers throughout\nthe U.S. have also been engaging in group purchasing.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Group_purchasing_organization","recorded":1362482978,"links":16,"instances":["business","marketing","united_states"],"pdf":["http://www.chca.com/mm/pdf/higpa_code_of_conduct.pdf","http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/healthcarehearings/docs/030926bloch.pdf"],"categories":["Health economics","Purchasing consortia"],"headings":["History","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["distributor","business"],["medicare","united_states"],["rebate","marketing"]],"members":["distributor","rebate","medicare"],"related":["Purchasing_power","Distributor_(business)","Industries","Raw_material","Grocery","Health_care","Electronics","Manufacturing","Agriculture","Medicare_(United_States)","Medicaid","Diagnosis","United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services","Benchmarking","Supply_chain","Foodservice","Grocery","Supply_chain","Poultry","Produce","Candy","Snacks","Dairy","Bakery","Dry_goods","Beverages","Procurement","Sourcing","Production_line","Raw_materials","Rebate_(marketing)","Discounts","Group_buy","Tuangou","Collective_buying_power","Vertical_market","Horizontal_market"]}
