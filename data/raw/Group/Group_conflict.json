Sigmund Freud, Civilization, Society and\nReligion (PFL 12) p. 353 Although group conflict is one of the most\ncomplex phenomena studied by social scientists, the history of the human race\nevidences a series of group-level conflicts that have gained notoriety over the\nyears. For example, from 1820 to 1945, it has been estimated that at least 59\nmillion persons were killed during conflicts between groups of one type or\nanother. Desmond Morris, The Naked Ape Trilogy (1994) p. 251\nLiterature suggests that the number of fatalities nearly doubled between the\nyears 1914 to 1964 as a result of further group conflict. R. D. Laing, [[The\nPolitics of Experience]] (1984) p. 64\n\nGroup conflict can be separated into two sub-categories of conflict: inter-group\nconflict (in which distinct groups of individuals are at odds with one another),\nand intra-group conflict (in which select individuals a part of the same group\nclash with one another). Although both forms of conflict have the ability to\nspiral upward in severity, it has been noted that conflict present at the group\nlevel (i.e., inter-group rivalries) is generally considered to be more powerful\nthan conflict present at an individual level â a phenomenon known as the\ndiscontinuity effect.
