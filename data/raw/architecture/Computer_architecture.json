{"cursor":"20202","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer science and engineering, 'computer architecture' is the art that\nspecifies the relations and parts of a computer system. In the\narchitecture of buildings, this art is normally visual, but computer\narchitecture is logical, defining systems to serve particular purposes. In both\ninstances (building and computer), a complete design has many details, and some\ndetails are implied by common practice.\n\nFor example, at a high level, computer architecture is concerned with how the\ncentral processing unit (CPU) acts and how it uses computer memory. Some\nfashionable (2011) computer architectures include cluster computing and Non-\nUniform Memory Access.\n\nComputer architects use computers to design new computers. Emulation software\ncan run programs written in a proposed instruction set. While the design is very\neasy to change at this stage, compiler designers often collaborate with the\narchitects, suggesting improvements in the instruction set. Modern emulators may\nmeasure time in clock cycles: estimate energy consumption in joules, and give\nrealistic estimates of code size in bytes. These affect the convenience of the\nuser, the life of a battery, and the size and expense of the computer's largest\nphysical part: its memory. That is, they help to estimate the value of a\ncomputer design.\n","linknr":310,"url":"Computer_architecture","recorded":1362675475,"links":57,"instances":["microelectronics","computer_language","programming_language","computing","computing","computer_programming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer architecture|","Central processing unit"],"headings":["History","Subcategories","Role","Design goals","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Internet_map_1024.jpg/28px-Internet_map_1024.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["c","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["c","computer_language"],["assembler","computer_programming"],["floorplan","microelectronics"],["pipeline","computing"],["benchmark","computing"]],"members":["floorplan","c","java","benchmark","pipeline","assembler"],"related":["Computer_science","Computer_engineering","Architecture","Central_processing_unit","Computer_memory","Cluster_computing","Non-Uniform_Memory_Access","Emulation","Compiler","Charles_Babbage","Ada_Lovelace","Analytical_engine","John_Von_Neumann","IBM","Stored_program_computer","IBM_7030_Stretch","Supercomputer","IBM_System/360","IBM_zSeries","Machine_code","Computer_processor","Machine_language","Assembly_language","Instruction_set","Word_size","Addressing_mode","Processor_register","CPU_cache","Computer_bus","Memory_controller","Memory_hierarchy","Direct_memory_access","Virtualization","Multiprocessing","Software","Architectural_layer","Machine_language","Compiler","C_(programming_language)","C++","Java_(programming_language)","Microprocessor","X86","Caches","High_level_language","Opcode","Binary_numeral_system","Compiler","C_(computer_language)","Data_type","Processor_register","Addressing_mode","Assembler_(computer_programming)","Disassembler","Debugger","Manchester_Small-Scale_Experimental_Machine","Virtual_memory","Engineering_design_process","Register-transfer_level","Logic_gate","Transistor","Arithmetic_logic_unit","Floorplan_(microelectronics)","FPGA","Central_processing_unit","CPU_design","Personal_computer","Clock_rate","Instructions_per_second","Superscalar","VAX","Functional_unit","Computer_bus","Interrupt_latency","Pipeline_(computing)","Real-time_computing","CPU_bound","I/O_bound","Memory_bound","Benchmark_(computing)","Intel_Core_2","Computer_hardware","CPU_design","Orthogonal_instruction_set","Software_architecture","Von_Neumann_architecture","Influence_of_the_IBM_PC_on_the_personal_computer_market","Comparison_of_CPU_architectures","Floating_point","Robert_S._Barton","Burroughs_large_systems","Gordon_Bell","Allen_Newell","Gerrit_Blaauw","Fred_Brooks"]}
