{"cursor":"98702","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 'history of India' begins with evidence of human activity of [[Anatomically\nmodern humans|Homo sapiens]] as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier\nhominids including [[Homo erectus]] from about 500,000 years ago. G. Bongard-\nLevin, A History of India (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1979) p. 11. The\nIndus Valley Civilization, which spread and flourished in the northwestern part\nof the Indian subcontinent from c. 3300 to 1300 BCE in present-day Pakistan and\nnorthwest India, was the first major civilization in South Asia. Romila\nThapar, A History of India (Penguin Books: New York, 1966) p. 23. A\nsophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature\nHarappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE. Romila Thapar, A History of India,\np. 24. This Bronze Age civilization collapsed before the end of the second\nmillennium BCE and was followed by the Iron Age Vedic Civilization, which\nextended over much of the Indo-Gangetic plain and which witnessed the rise of\nmajor polities known as the Mahajanapadas. In one of these kingdoms, Magadha,\nMahavira and Gautama Buddha were born in the 6th or 5th century BCE and\npropagated their [[Shramana|Åramanic]] philosophies.\n\nMost of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and\n3rd centuries BCE. It became fragmented, with various parts ruled by numerous\nMiddle kingdoms for the next 1,500 years. This is known as the classical period\nof Indian history, during which time India has sometimes been estimated to have\nhad the largest economy of the ancient and medieval world, with its huge\npopulation generating between one fourth and one third of the world's income up\nto the 18th century. Much of northern and central India was united in the 4th\ncentury CE, and remained so for two centuries, under the Gupta Empire. This\nperiod, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence, is known as\nthe \"Golden Age of India\". From this time, and for several centuries afterwards,\nsouthern India, under the rule of the Chalukyas, Cholas, Pallavas, and Pandyas,\nexperienced its own golden age. During this period, aspects of Indian\ncivilization, administration, culture, and religion (Hinduism and Buddhism)\nspread to much of Asia.\n\nKingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire\nfrom around 77 CE. Muslim rule in the subcontinent began in 8th century CE when\nthe Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Multan in southern\nPunjab in modern day Pakistan, setting the stage for\nseveral successive invasions from Central Asia between the 10th and 15th\ncenturies CE, leading to the formation of Muslim empires in the Indian\nsubcontinent such as the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. Mughal rule came\nfrom Central Asia to cover most of the northern parts of the subcontinent.\nMughal rulers introduced Central Asian art and architecture to India. In\naddition to the Mughals and various Rajput kingdoms, several independent Hindu\nstates, such as the Vijayanagara Empire, the Maratha Empire, Eastern Ganga\nEmpire and the Ahom Kingdom, flourished contemporaneously in southern, western,\neastern and northeastern India respectively. The Mughal Empire suffered a\ngradual decline in the early 18th century, which provided opportunities for the\nAfghans, Balochis, Sikhs, and Marathas to exercise control over large areas in\nthe northwest of the subcontinent until the British East India Company gained\nascendancy over South Asia.\n\nBeginning in the mid-18th century and over the next century, large areas of\nIndia were annexed by the British East India Company. Dissatisfaction with\nCompany rule led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, after which the British\nprovinces of India were directly administered by the British Crown and witnessed\na period of both rapid development of infrastructure and economic decline.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, a nationwide struggle for\nindependence was launched by the Indian National Congress and later joined by\nthe Muslim League. The subcontinent gained independence from the United Kingdom\nin 1947, after the British provinces were partitioned into the dominions of\nIndia and Pakistan and the princely states all acceded to one of the new states.\n","linknr":1840,"url":"History_of_India","recorded":1362373351,"links":121,"instances":["1905","delhi","1556","british_india","1760","1748","kingdom","roman_province","india","disambiguation","ancient_city","region","general","india","jain","india"],"pdf":["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf","http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf","http://www.indianscience.org/essays/22-%20E--Gems%20&%20Minerals%20F.pdf","http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHN%20PDF/Transformation%20from%20a%20Pre-Colonial%20-%20Om%20Prakash.pdf","http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHN%20PDF/Transformation%20from%20a%20Pre-Colonial%20-%20Om%20Prakash.pdf","http://www.petersoninstitute.org/publications/chapters_preview/98/1iie2806.pdf"],"categories":["History
