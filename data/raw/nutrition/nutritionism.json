{"cursor":"5445","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Nutritionism' is an alleged paradigm that assumes that it is the scientifically\nidentified nutrients in foods that determine the value of individual food stuffs\nin the diet. In other words, it is the idea that the\nnutritional value of a food is the sum of all its individual nutrients,\nvitamins, and other components. Another aspect of the term is the implication\nthat the only point of eating is to promote bodily health. The term is largely\npejorative, implying that this way of viewing food is simplistic and harmful,\nand the term is usually used to label others' views. The term's most prominent\nproponent, journalist Michael Pollan, argues that a food's nutritional value is\n\"more than the sum of its parts.\"\n\nOriginally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis, {{cite web\n | url = http://www.gyorgyscrinis.com title = Gyorgy Scrinis' Web Page |\n | accessdate = 2009-01-14\n}} the notion was popularized by Michael Pollan. {{cite news\n | last = Pollan | first = Michael url =\n | http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html title =\n | Unhappy Meals | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2007-01-28\n}} The key to Pollan's understanding of nutritionism is \"the widely shared\nbut unexamined assumption ... that the key to understanding food is indeed the\nnutrient.\" Since nutrients are invisible, it is now necessary to rely on\nnutrition experts to make food choices. Because science has an incomplete\nunderstanding of how food affects the human body, Pollan argues, relying solely\non information regarding individual nutrients has led people and policy makers\nto repeatedly make poor decisions relating to nutrition. {{cite book\n | last = Pollan | first = Michael title = In Defense of Food: An Eater's\n | Manifesto isbn = 978-1-59420-145-5 |publisher = Penguin Press location = New\n | York, USA | year = 2008\n}} Pollan blames nutritionism for many of the health problems relating to\ndiet in the Western World today. He compares Nutritionism to a religion, relying\non \"priests\" (nutritional scientists and journalists) to interpret the latest\northodoxy for the masses. Like many religions, nutritionism has divided the\nworld into good and evil components, although what is good or evil can change\ndramatically with time. Pollan believes that nutritionism is inherently flawed\ndue to a reductive bias within science to isolate and study individual factors\ndisconnected from their usual contexts such as diet and culture, factors which\nhave repeatedly been shown to have a fundamental impact on nutritional outcomes.\nEven when scientists have attempted to study factors such as culture, diet, and\nlong term consumption patterns, the enormous difficulties in making accurate\nmeasurements relating to individual nutritional components, and producing\nmeaningful conclusions has resulted in incomplete results at best, and\nmisleading or harmful results at worst.\n\nBen Goldacre wrote that nutritionism, or its attribution to scientists, is the\n\"bollocks du jour\", and that it is \"driven by a set of first year undergraduate\nerrors in interpreting scientific data.\" {{cite web\n | first = Ben | last = Goldacre | date = 2007-01-22 | publisher=New Statesman\n | title=Science and Fiction | pages=16â17 |accessdate=May 19, 2013\n | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/pdf/ethicalfood07.pdf\n}} In his opinion, professional researchers and medical experts bear some\nblame for nutritionism because they at times created unrealistic expectations\nabout the potential benefits of their research, but that the primary promoters\nof nutritionism are health food manufacturers, self proclaimed \"gurus\" and\njournalists who have an incomplete understanding of science, along with a\ncredulous public that is willing to believe whatever simplistic theories they\nare told in the mass media.\n\nAt least one observer, Daniel Engber has argued that Pollan's anti-nutritionism,\nor anti-food science stance has taken on a dogmatic tint itself. He says,\n\"Modern nutrition may be more of an ideology than a science, but so is Pollan's\nnutritional Darwinism. The two ideologies stand in direct opposition to one\nanother, with the science-minded progressives on one side and the culinary\nconservatives on the other.\" {{cite web\n | first = Daniel | last = Engber title = Survival of the Yummiest: Should we\n | buy Michael Pollan's nutritional Darwinism? publisher = Slate | date = 2008-01-\n | 02 |accessdate= 2010-06-01 url=http://www.slate.com/id/2181149/\n}} One criticism is that while many scientific studies of nutrition, or\nthe conclusions extrapolated from them by both scientists and journalists have\nbeen bad, we should not reject a scientific approach to food altogether. One\nreviewer notes that the study of vitamins and nutrients led to vast improvement\nin treatment of diseases such as beriberi or scurvy and that with further\nrefinement food science may well help combat other diseases and health\nconditions. The complexity of food science should not be taken as a reason to\nabandon systematic investigation of it. Daniel Engber also argues that Pollan\nover idealizes the diet of our ancestors, and believes that it may not be well\nsuited to our modern needs.\n","linknr":109,"url":"nutritionism","recorded":1371246980,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Paradigm","/wiki/Nutrients","/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)","#cite_note-unhappy-1","/wiki/Journalist","/wiki/Michael_Pollan","#cite_note-2","#cite_note-unhappy-1","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Western_World","/wiki/Orthodoxy","/wiki/Reduction_(philosophy)","/wiki/Ben_Goldacre","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Food_science","#cite_note-Enber-5","/wiki/Vitamin","/wiki/Beriberi","/wiki/Scurvy","#cite_note-Enber-5","/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-unhappy_1-0","#cite_ref-unhappy_1-1","http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","#cite_ref-2","http://www.gyorgyscrinis.com","#cite_ref-3","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1-59420-145-5","#cite_ref-4","http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/pdf/ethicalfood07.pdf","#cite_ref-Enber_5-0","#cite_ref-Enber_5-1","http://www.slate.com/id/2181149/","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&oldid=555798386","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Nutrition","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nutritionism&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nutritionism","/wiki/Nutritionism","/wiki/Talk:Nutritionism","#","/wiki/Nutritionism","/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nutritionism","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nutritionism","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&oldid=555798386","/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nutritionism&id=555798386","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nutritionism","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nutritionism&oldid=555798386&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nutritionism&printable=yes","//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA%D8%AA%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%A1","//ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutricionisme","//es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutricionismo","//eo.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutradismo","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrizionismo","//simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionism","//fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionismi","//zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%90%A5%E5%85%BB%E4%B8%BB%E4%B9%89","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2529411#sitelinks","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionism","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":["nutrition","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/pdf/ethicalfood07.pdf"],"categories":["Nutrition"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf6/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","/
