{"cursor":"6419","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nOverview A 'positive displacement meter' is a type of flow meter that requires\nfluid to mechanically displace components in the meter in order for flow\nmeasurement. Positive displacement (PD) flow meters measure the volumetric flow\nrate of a moving fluid or gas by dividing the media into fixed, metered volumes\n(finite increments or volumes of the fluid). A basic analogy would be holding a\nbucket below a tap, filling it to a set level, then quickly replacing it with\nanother bucket and timing the rate at which the buckets are filled (or the total\nnumber of buckets for the âtotalizedâ flow). With appropriate pressure and\ntemperature compensation, the mass flow rate can be accurately determined.\n\nThese devices consist of a chamber(s) that obstructs the media flow and a\nrotating or reciprocating mechanism that allows the passage of fixed-volume\namounts. The number of parcels that pass through the chamber determines the\nmedia volume. The rate of revolution or reciprocation determines the flow rate.\nThere are two basic types of positive displacement flow meters. Sensor-only\nsystems or transducers are switch-like devices that provide electronic outputs\nfor processors, controllers, or data acquisition systems.\n\nComplete sensor systems provide additional capabilities such as an integral\ndisplay and/or user interface. For both types of positive displacement flow\nmeters, performance specifications include the minimum and maximum measurable\nflow rate, operating pressure, temperature range, maximum allowable material\nviscosity, connection size, and percent accuracy (typically as a percentage of\nactual reading, not full scale). Suppliers indicate whether devices are designed\nto measure fluid or gas.\n\nTypes of Positive Displacement Flow Meters The meters come in several forms,\nincluding:\n\nReciprocating piston / Oscillating piston Each piston is mechanically or\nmagnetically operated to fill a cylinder with the fluid and then discharge the\nfluid. Each stroke represents a finite measurement of the fluid.\n\nGear Gear flow meters rely on internal gears rotating as fluid passes through\nthem. There are various types of gear meters named mostly for the shape of the\ninternal components\n* 'Oval Gear' Two rotating oval gears with synchronized teeth âsqueezeâ a finite\n  amount of fluid through the meter for each revolution. With oval gear flow\n  meters, two oval gears or rotors are mounted inside a cylinder. As the fluid\n  flows through the cylinder, the pressure of the fluid causes the rotors to\n  rotate. As flow rate increases, so does the rotational speed of the rotors.\n\n* 'Helical Gear' Helical gear flow meters get their name from the shape of their\n  gears or rotors. These rotors resemble the shape of a helix, which is a spiral-\n  shaped structure. As the fluid flows through the meter, it enters the\n  compartments in the rotors, causing the rotors to rotate. Flowrate is\n  calculated from the speed of rotation.\n\nNutating disk A disk mounted on a sphere is âwobbledâ about an axis by the fluid\nflow and each rotation represents a finite amount of fluid transferred. Nutating\ndisc flow meters get their name from the idea of nutation, which means nodding\nor rocking. A nutating disc meter has a round disc mounted on a spindle in a\ncylindrical chamber. By tracking the movements of the spindle, the flow meter\ndetermines the number of times the chamber traps and empties fluid. This\ninformation is used to determine flow rate.\n\nRotary vane A rotating impeller containing two or more vanes divides the\nspaces between the vanes into discrete volumes and each rotation (or vane\npassing) is counted.\n\nDiaphragm Fluid is drawn into the inlet side of an oscillating diaphragm and\nthen dispelled to the outlet. The diaphragm oscillating cycles are counted to\ndetermine the flow rate.\n\nAdvantages and Considerations Positive displacement flowmeters are very\naccurate and have high turndown. They can be used in very viscous, dirty and\ncorrosive fluids and essentially require no straight runs of pipe for fluid\nflow stream conditioning though pressure drop can be an issue. They are widely\nused in custody transfer of oils and liquid fluids (gasoline) and are applied\non residential home natural gas and water metering. A diaphragm meter, with\nwhich most homes are equipped, is an example of a positive displacement meter.\nThis type of meter is appealing in certain custody transfer flow applications\nwhere it is critical that the metering be functional in order for any flow to\ntake place.\n\nPD flowmeters, with internal wiping seals, produce the highest differential\npressure (and subsequently greatest pressure drop head loss) of all the\nflowmeter types. Meters that rely on a liquid seal create a relatively low\npressure drop.\n\nPositive-displacement (PD) meters can measure both liquids and gases. Like\nturbine meters, PD flow meters work best with clean, non-corrosive, and non-\nerosive liquids and gases, although some models will tolerate some impurities.\nBecause of their high accuracy, PD meters are widely used at residences to\nmeasure the amount of gas or water used. Commercial/Industrial applications\ninclude: chemical injection, fuel measurement, precision test stands, high\npressure, hydraulic testing and many other precision applications. http://www.maxmachinery.com/flow-measurement-\nindustries\n\nSome designs require that only lubricating fluid be measured, because the rotors\nare exposed to the fluid. PD meters differ from turbine meters in that they\nhandle medium and high-viscosity liquids well. For this reason, they are often\nused to measure the flow of hydraulic fluids. PD meters above 10 in. tend to be\nheavy, large, because of the materials of use and internal parts. PD meters\nrequire very little upstream piping, and can easily handle low flows.\n\nSee also *Water meter *Oil meter *Gas meter *Flow measurement *Displacement\nVolumetric
