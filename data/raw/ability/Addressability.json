{"cursor":"8002","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Addressability' is the ability of a digital device to individually respond to a\nmessage sent to many similar devices. Examples include pagers, mobile phones,\nand set-top boxes for pay TV. Computer networks are also addressable, such as\nvia the MAC address on Ethernet network cards, and similar networking protocols\nlike Bluetooth. This allows data to be sent in cases where it is impractical (or\nimpossible, such as with wireless devices) to control exactly where or to which\ndevices the message is physically sent.\n\nIn the case of simple hardware devices like the pager, the address is simply the\nelectronic serial number (and later IMEI/MEID) in its firmware, or physically\nmanufactured into its circuitry. In the case of GSM mobile phones, it also\nincludes the subscriber identity module, which is also present as a smart card\non satellite TV receivers, or a different PCMCIA CableCARD for cable TV.\nAddressing and encryption are used together for conditional access to different\nTV channel bundles which a pay-TV customer has or has not paid for.\n\nAddressing is also done in software at higher levels such as IP addresses, which\ncan be dynamically allocated. Even physically separate devices are now\naddressable, such as to enforce revocation lists for digital restrictions, or to\nuse the former DIVX DVD video rentals (although the latter only used its\nidentity to \"phone home\" for billing purposes).\n","linknr":183,"url":"Addressability","recorded":1362566034,"links":14,"instances":["computing","electronics"],"pdf":["http://www.scatmag.com/technical/feb_03.pdf","http://www.sciatl.com/products/customers/white-papers/AddTapPaper8.pdf"],"categories":["Cable television technology","Television terminology"],"headings":["Cable TV","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["controller","control_theory"],["signal","electronics"],["controller","computing"]],"members":["controller","signal"],"related":["Digital","Pager","Mobile_phone","Set-top_box","Pay_TV","Computer_network","MAC_address","Ethernet","Network_card","Networking_protocol","Bluetooth","Data","Wireless","Data_switching","Computer_hardware","Electronic_serial_number","IMEI","MEID","Firmware","Manufacture","Circuitry","GSM","Subscriber_identity_module","Smart_card","Satellite_TV","Integrated_receiver/decoder","PCMCIA_card","CableCARD","Cable_TV","Encryption","Conditional_access","TV_channel","Product_bundling","Paid","Software","IP_address","DHCP","Revocation_list","Digital_restrictions_management","DIVX","DVD","Video_rental","Phone_home","Invoice","Cable_Television","Provisioning","Parlance","Authorization","CATV","Conditional_access_system","Service_provider","Cable_television_headend","Business_Support_Systems","Operations_Support_System","Controller_(control_theory)","Set-top_box","Cable_Converter_Box","Integrated_receiver/decoder","Signal_(electronics)","Uplink","Downlink","Satellite","Encrypted","Scrambler","General_Instrument","Motorola","Controller_(computing)","Business_support_system","Operations_support_system","Cable_television_headend","Set-top_box","Cable_converter","Scrambler","Encryption","Provisioning","Conditional_access_system","One-time_pad","Voice_inversion","ATSC_tuner","Sound_reproduction","Cable_modem","RS-232","USB","Bluetooth","Wi-Fi","Digital_television_adapter","DOCSIS","Digital_Video_Broadcasting","Free-to-air","Interactive_television","IPTV","QAM_tuner","QPSK","Symbol_rate"]}
