Last Revised: 20 October\n2006 is the in measurements taken by a single person or instrument on the\nsame item and under the same conditions. A less-than-perfect test-retest\nreliability causes 'test-retest variability'. Such variability can be caused by,\nfor example, intra-individual variability and intra-observer variability. A\nmeasurement may be said to be repeatable when this variation is smaller than\nsome agreed limit.\n\nTest-retest variability is practically used, for example, in medical monitoring\nof conditions. In these situations, there is often a predetermined \"critical\ndifference\", and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this\ncritical difference, the possibility of pre-test variability as a sole cause of\nthe difference may be considered in addition to, for examples, changes in\ndiseases or treatments.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Repeatability","recorded":1362480293,"links":20,"instances":["medicine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Psychometrics","Metrology","Statistical terminology"],"headings":["Establishment","Desirability of repeatability","Attribute Agreement Analysis for Defect Databases","Psychological testing","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["monitoring","medicine"]],"members":["monitoring"],"related":["Measurement","Measuring_instrument","Intra-individual_variability","Intra-observer_variability","Medical_monitoring","Correlation","Internal_consistency","Absolute_difference","Standard_deviation","Accuracy_and_precision","Accuracy","Personality_type","Carryover_effect","Monitoring_(medicine)","Accuracy","Accuracy_and_precision","Reproducibility"]}
