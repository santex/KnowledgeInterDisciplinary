In this sense, falsify is synonym to nullify,\nmeaning not \"to commit fraud\" but \"show to be false\".\n\nBy the problem of induction, no number of confirming observations can verify a\nuniversal generalization, such as All swans are white, yet it is logically\npossible to falsify it, as by observing a black swan. Thus, the term\nfalsifiability is sometimes synonym to testability. Some statements, such as It\nwill be raining here in one million years, are falsifiable in principle, but not\nin practice.

In this,\nPopper stresses the problem of demarcationâsorting the scientific from the\nunscientificâand lays the demarcation criterion falsifibility, such that the\nunfalsifiable are unscientific, and the practice of declaring an unfalsifiable\ntheory proved true by scientific method is pseudoscience.\n\nIn falsificationism, an unfalsifiable and thus unscientific theory is not\nintrinsically false or inappropriate, however, as metaphysical theories might be\ntrue or contain truth, and are required to help inform science or structure\nscientific theories. Simply, to be scientific, a theory must predict at least\nsome observation potentially refutable by observation. (Falsificationism is not\na general epistemology, then, which for Popper is critical rationalism, aimed to\nbe the first epistemology fully based on criticism and discarding quest for\njustification.)\n","linknr":778,"url":"Falsifiability","recorded":1362484639,"links":62,"instances":["logic","judge","government_funded","science","philosophy","philosopher","logic"],"pdf":["http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf","http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/staff/miller/miller_pli_9.pdf"],"categories":["Analytic
