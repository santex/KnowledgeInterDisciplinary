{"cursor":"5884","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn numerous fields of study, the component of 'instability' within a system is\ngenerally characterized by some of the outputs or internal states growing\nwithout bounds. Not all systems that are not stable are unstable; systems can\nalso be marginally stable or exhibit limit cycle behavior.\n\nIn control theory, a system is unstable if any of the roots of its\ncharacteristic equation has real part greater than zero (or if zero is a\nrepeated root). This is equivalent to any of the eigenvalues of the state matrix\nhaving either real part greater than zero, or, for the eigenvalues on the\nimaginary axis, the algebraic multiplicity being larger than the geometric\nmultiplicity.\n\nIn structural engineering, a structure can become unstable when excessive load\nis applied. Beyond a certain threshold, structural deflections magnify stresses,\nwhich in turn increases deflections. This can take the form of buckling or\ncrippling. The general field of study is called structural stability.\n\nAtmospheric instability is a major component of all weather systems on Earth.\n","linknr":201,"url":"Instability","recorded":1362539073,"links":23,"instances":["physics","physics","controls","engineering","controls"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Systems theory","Concepts in physics","Plasma physics","Stability theory"],"headings":["Fluid instabilities","Plasma instabilities","Instabilities of stellar systems","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Unstable3.svg/220px-Unstable3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif/220px-HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Fluid_Instability.jpg/220px-Fluid_Instability.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["state","controls"],["state_space","controls"],["deflection","engineering"],["stress","physics"],["plasma","physics"]],"members":["plasma","stress","state_space","deflection","state"],"related":["System","Outputs","State_(controls)","Bounds","Stability_theory","Marginal_stability","Limit_cycle","Control_theory","Root_of_a_function","Characteristic_equation","Real_part","Eigenvalues","State_space_(controls)","Structural_engineering","Deflection_(engineering)","Stress_(physics)","Buckling","Structural_stability","Atmospheric_instability","Weather_system","Rayleigh–Taylor_instability","Fluid","Liquids","Gases","Plasma_physics","Fluid_dynamics","Magnetohydrodynamics","Magnetosphere","Atmospheric_instability","Hydrodynamic_instability","Dynamic_instability","Atmospheric_dynamics","Inertial_instability","Baroclinic_instability","Symmetric_instability","Conditional_symmetric_instability","Conditional_symmetric_instability","Barotropic_instability","Helmholtz_instability","Helmholtz_instability","Rotational_instability","Hydrostatic_instability","Static_instability","Static_instability","Static_instability","Thermodynamic_instability","Atmospheric_thermodynamics","Conditional_instability","Static_instability","Buoyant_instability","Latent_instability","Nonlocal_static_instability","Conditional-symmetric_instability","Convective_instability","Convective_instability","Convective_instability","Convective_instability_of_the_first_kind","Convective_instability_of_the_second_kind","Absolute_instability","Absolute_instability","Bénard_cells","Kelvin–Helmholtz_instability","Diocotron_instability","Rayleigh–Taylor_instability","Plateau-Rayleigh_instability","Richtmyer-Meshkov_instability","Shock_wave","Plasma_(physics)","Galaxies","Star_cluster","Gravitational_potential","Bar_instability","Jeans_instability","Firehose_instability","Gravothermal_instability","Radial-orbit_instability","Plasma_stability"]}
