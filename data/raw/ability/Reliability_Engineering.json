Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (1990) IEEE\nStandard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer\nGlossaries. New York, NY ISBN 1-55937-079-3 Reliability engineering is a\nsub-discipline within systems engineering. Reliability is theoretically defined\nas the probability of failure, the frequency of failures, or in terms of\navailability, a probability derived from reliability and maintainability.\nMaintainability and maintenance may be defined as a part of reliability\nengineering. Reliability plays a key role in cost-effectiveness of systems.\n\nReliability engineering for complex systems requires a different, more elaborate\nsystems approach than for non-complex systems. Reliability analysis has\nimportant links with functional analysis, requirements specification, hardware &\nsoftware design, manufacturing, testing, maintenance, transport, storage, spare\nparts, operations research, human factors, technical documentation and work\nskill training. Effective reliability engineering requires experience, broad\nengineering skills and knowledge from many different fields of engineering.\n\nReliability engineering is closely related to safety engineering and system\nsafety, in that they use common methods for their analysis and may require input\nfrom each other. Reliability engineering focuses on costs of failure caused by\nsystem downtime, cost of spares, repair equipment, personnel and cost of\nwarranty claims. The focus of safety engineering is normally not on cost, but on\npreserving life and nature, and therefore deals only with particular dangerous\nsystem failure modes. High reliability (safety) levels are also here the result\nof good engineering, attention to detail and almost never the result of re-\nactive failure management (Reliability Accounting / Statistics). http://lambdaconsulting.co.za/rwa%20barnard%20incose%202008-\n.pdf\n\n\"Reliability is, after all, engineering in its most practical form\" as\nonce stated by James R. Schlesinger, Former US Secretary of State for\nDefense. O'Connor, Patrick D. T. (2002),\nPractical Reliability Engineering (Fourth Ed.), John Wiley & Sons, New\nYork.
