Tomas and Andreas had decided to start a band when they met during their\nmilitary service, serving together in the same platoon. Originally called\nValkyrian they decided to change their name to Hollow which they felt was more\nin tune with their musical style \"The name Hollow reflects the constant void\nwithin, which we all feel from time to time\".\n\nInfluenced by acts such as QueensrÃ¿che, Crimson Glory and Elegy in 1995 they\nreleased a six track demo called \"Speak To Me\". In 1997 they released a self-\ntitled Ep with four tracks which caught the attention of MM Records, a small\nindependent label. They then went on to create two albums both released through\nNuclear Blast Records, Modern Cathedral (1997) and Architect Of The Mind (1999).\n\nHollow chose to split up not long after the release of Architect Of The Mind.\n\nHollow is now a solo project of Andreas Stoltz, who in 2009 released the song\n\"Descending\" which was written in memory of Midnight, Crimson Glory's vocalist,\nwho died in 2009.\n\nIn 2010 Polish record label Metal Mind Productions remastered and rereleased\nArchitect Of The Mind and Modern Cathedral as a double pack.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Hollow_(band)","recorded":1362568540,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Swedish heavy metal musical groups","Swedish progressive metal musical groups","Swedish power metal musical groups","Musical quintets","Nuclear Blast Records artists"],"headings":["Members","Discography","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Umeå","Sweden","Power_metal","Progressive_metal","Nuclear_Blast","Metal_Mind_Productions","Power_metal","Umeå","Sweden","Umeå","Queensrÿche","Crimson_Glory","Elegy","Nuclear_Blast_Records","Poland","Metal_Mind_Productions","Concept_album","Artificial_intelligence"]}
