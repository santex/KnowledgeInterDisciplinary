{"cursor":"4152","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Hand pollination' (also called \"mechanical pollination\") is a technique used\nwhen natural, or open pollination is insufficient or undesirable. The most\ncommon techniques are for crops such as cucurbits, which may exhibit poor\npollination by fruit abortion, fruit deformity or poor maturation. Hand-\npollination is an option only on a small scale, but is a common technique by\ngardeners that transfer pollen with an artist brush or cotton swab. Sometimes\nthe corolla is removed from male flowers and the flower itself is brushed\nagainst the stigmas of female flowers.\n\nThe principal reasons for hand pollination include a paucity of natural\npollinators, avoiding cross-pollination between varieties grown together\nor, conversely, in the controlled production of hybrids.\n\nHand-pollination can be the simple act of shaking, with tomatoes and other self-\nfertile flowers. In general, tomatoes grown in greenhouses need aid in\npollination, which has been done by hand or with an electric vibrator for a long\ntime. Recently, it has been mostly supplanted by cultured bumblebees.\n\nWhen pollination is needed on a large scale, such as for field crops, orchards,\nor commercial seed production, honeybees or other pollinators are cultured and\nprovided for pollination management.\n\nThe primary reason for hand-pollination is lack of pollinators, which may be due\nto the act of moving crops from home areas (as in vanilla beans) without also\ntaking the natural pollinator. Pollinator decline or the concentrated\npollination needs of monoculture may also be other factors in pollination\nshortage. That's why we cannot be sure.\n\nAnother reason for hand-pollination is in order to control the parents of the\nseed to be produced. For example, all F1 hybrids are the result of pollinating\none specific variety with another specific variety, in order to produce a\nuniform crop.\n\nFor pest prevention with some high-value crops, row covers of mesh are used to\nprevent pest insects from access to the plants. However, this may necessitate\nhand-pollination when bloom starts.\n\nHand-pollination is used with date palms to avoid wasting a lot of space and\nenergy growing sufficient male plants for adequate natural pollination.\n\nVariable techniques for hand-pollination have arisen for many specialty crops.\n\nPears grown in Hanyuan County, of China have been hand-pollinated since regional\nbees were wiped out by pesticides in the 1980s (though the pears were pollinated\nby hand, in order to produce better fruit, even before the bees were destroyed\nhttp://www.beewatchers.com/2010/02/why-not-just-bring-in-more-bees.html\nbeewatchers ). If human were to replace bees as pollinators in the United\nStates, the annual cost is estimated at $90,000,000,000.
