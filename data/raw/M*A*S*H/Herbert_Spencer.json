He was \"an enthusiastic exponent of evolution\" and\neven \"wrote about evolution before Darwin did.\" Riggenbach,\nJeff (2011-04-24) [http://mises.org/daily/5206/The-Real-William-Graham-Sumner\nThe Real William Graham Sumner], Mises Institute As a polymath, he\ncontributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion,\nanthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, biology, sociology, and\npsychology. During his lifetime he achieved tremendous authority, mainly in English-\nspeaking academia. \"The only other English philosopher to have achieved anything\nlike such widespread popularity was Bertrand Russell, and that was in the 20th\ncentury.\" Richards, Peter (2010-11-04) [http://mises.org/daily/4779/Herbert-Spencer-Social-Darwinist-or-Libertarian-\nProphet Herbert Spencer: Social Darwinist or Libertarian Prophet?], Mises\nInstitute Spencer was \"the single most famous European intellectual in the\nclosing decades of the nineteenth century\" Thomas Eriksen and FinnNielsen, A\nhistory of anthropology (2001) p. 37 \"Spencer became the most famous\nphilosopher of his time,\" says Henry L. Tischler, Introduction to Sociology\n(2010) p. 12 but his influence declined sharply after 1900; \"Who now reads\nSpencer?\" asked Talcott Parsons in 1937. Talcott Parsons, The Structure of\nSocial Action (1937; New York: Free Press, 1968), p. 3; quoting from C. Crane\nBrinton, English Political Thought in the Nineteenth Century (London: Benn,\n1933).\n\nSpencer is best known for coining the concept \"survival of the fittest\", which\nhe did in Principles of Biology (1864), after reading Charles Darwin's [[On the\nOrigin of Species]].   This term strongly suggests\nnatural selection, yet as Spencer extended evolution into realms of sociology\nand ethics, he also made use of Lamarckism.\n","linknr":829,"url":"Herbert_Spencer","recorded":1362480776,"links":77,"instances":["journalist","journalist","language","literature","philosophy","publisher","philosopher"],"pdf":["http://www.shpltd.co.uk/elwick-spencer.pdf","http://www.historians.org/annual/2006/06program/precirculated/Session145_Rafferty.pdf","http://praxeology.net/herbertspencerlibertarianprophet.pdf","http://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/2_2/2_2_9.pdf"],"categories":["Herbert
