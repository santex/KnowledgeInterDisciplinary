The\npopulation was 299 at the 2010 census. It was named for Henry Church and his\nwife, the first settlers who lived to be 109 and 106. Hundred is the only place\nin the United States with this name.\n\nHundred is so named because Henry Church would sit on a rocking chair on his\nporch near the train station. As the train came into the station, people would\nsay \"There's old Hundred,\" referring to his age. Eventually the name stuck and\nthe station- and the town- became known as Hundred.\n","linknr":234,"url":"Hundred,_West_Virginia","recorded":1362576358,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Towns in West Virginia","Populated places in Wetzel County, West Virginia"],"headings":["Geography","Demographics","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/HundredWVASign.jpg/220px-HundredWVASign.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Hundred_High_School_%28Hundred%2C_West_Virginia%2C_2006-10-05%29.jpg/300px-Hundred_High_School_%28Hundred%2C_West_Virginia%2C_2006-10-05%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Map_of_West_Virginia_highlighting_Wetzel_County.svg/180px-Map_of_West_Virginia_highlighting_Wetzel_County.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["white","u.s._census"],["hispanic","u.s._census"],["latino","u.s._census"],["white","u.s._census"],["african_american","u.s._census"]],"members":["hispanic","african_american","latino","white"],"related":["Town","List_of_countries","United_States","Political_divisions_of_the_United_States","West_Virginia","List_of_counties_in_West_Virginia","Wetzel_County,_West_Virginia","2010_United_States_Census","North_American_Eastern_Time_Zone","ZIP_code","Area_code_304","Federal_Information_Processing_Standard","Geographic_Names_Information_System","Wetzel_County,_West_Virginia","West_Virginia","United_States","2010_United_States_Census","Henry_Church","United_States","Porch_sitting","United_States_Census_Bureau","Census","Population_density","White_(U.S._Census)","Hispanic_(U.S._Census)","Latino_(U.S._Census)","Marriage","Census","Population_density","White_(U.S._Census)","African_American_(U.S._Census)","Marriage","Per_capita_income","Poverty_line"]}
