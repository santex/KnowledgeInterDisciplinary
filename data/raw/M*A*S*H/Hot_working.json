{"cursor":"5325","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Hot working' refers to processes where metals are plastically deformed above\ntheir recrystallization temperature. Being above the recrystallization\ntemperature allows the material to recrystallize during deformation. This is\nimportant because recrystallization keeps the materials from strain\nhardening, which ultimately keeps the yield strength and hardness low and\nductility high. Degarmo, p. 373. This contrasts\nwith cold working.\n","linknr":125,"url":"Hot_working","recorded":1362538174,"links":14,"instances":["metalworking","metalworking","metallurgy","iron"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Metalworking","Metallurgical processes"],"headings":["Temperature","Advantages & disadvantages","Processes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Schmiedefeuer_2.jpg/220px-Schmiedefeuer_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["recrystallization","metallurgy"],["ferrite","iron"],["rolling","metalworking"],["drawing","metalworking"]],"members":["drawing","rolling","recrystallization","ferrite"],"related":["Metal","Recrystallization_(metallurgy)","Strain_hardening","Yield_strength","Hardness","Ductility","Cold_working","Melting_temperature","Absolute_temperature_scale","Austenite","Ferrite_(iron)","Casting","Crystallite","Anisotropic","Fracturing","Rolling_(metalworking)","Hot_rolling","Extrusion","Forging","Drawing_(metalworking)","Rotary_piercing"]}
