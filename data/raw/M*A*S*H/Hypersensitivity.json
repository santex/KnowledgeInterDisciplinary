These reactions may be damaging,\nuncomfortable, or occasionally fatal. Hypersensitivity reactions require a pre-\nsensitized (immune) state of the host. The four-group classification was\nexpounded by P. H. G. Gell and Robin Coombs in 1963. Gell PGH, Coombs RRA,\neds. Clinical Aspects of Immunology. 1st ed.
