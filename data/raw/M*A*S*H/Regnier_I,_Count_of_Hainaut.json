(c. 850 –\n915) He died at Meerssen between 25 August 915 and 19 January 916. Some\nsources push the latest possible death date back to 15 November 915. was\nthe Duke of Lorraine from 910 until his death. He stands at the head of the clan\nof Reginarids, an important Lotharingian noble family.\n\nHe was the son of Gilbert, Count of the Maasgau, and a daughter of Lothair I of\nwhom the name is not known (Hiltrude, Bertha, Irmgard, and Gisela are good\ncandidates).\n\nHe succeeded his father in the Maasgau and was the lay abbot of Echternach\nbetween 897 and 915, of Maastricht from before May 898, and of Stablo and\nMalmedy between 900 and 902.\n\nHe was the Count of Mons when in 870 he and Franco, Bishop of LiÃ¨ge, led an army\nagainst the Vikings in Walacria. He, as Duke of Hesbaye and Hainault, and\nRadbold led a Frisian army with against the forces of Rollo a little later, but\nwere forced back to his fortresses.\n\nIn an 877 capitulary from Quierzy, he appears alongside his father as one of the\nregents of the kingdom during Charles the Bald's absence on campaign in Italy. A\nReginar appears at the Siege of Paris in 886, but this may be an uncle or\nnephew. The name \"Reginar\" or \"Reginhar\" ( or ) was commonplace in his family.\n\nReginar was originally a supporter of Zwentibold in 895, but he broke with the\nking in 898. He and some other magnates who had been key to Zwentibold's\nelection three years earlier then took the opportunity provided by the death of\nOdo of West Francia to invite Charles the Simple to become king in Lotharingia.\nHis lands were confiscated, but he refused to give them up and entrenched\nhimself at Durfost, downstream from Maastricht. Representatives of Charles,\nZwentibold, and the Emperor Arnulf met at Sankt Goar and determined that the\nsuccession should go to Louis the Child. Zwentibold was killed by the rebels in\nbattle in August 900.\n\nAt first, Louis appeared to be opposed to Reginar when he appointed Gebhard as\nhis deputy in Lotharingia, but the two were never at war. In 908, Reginar\nrecuperated the Hainault after the death of Sigard. Then, after the death of\nGebhard in 910, in battle with the Magyars, Reginar appears as his successor. He\nled the magnates in opposing Conrad I of Germany and electing Charles the Simple\ntheir king. He was given the title ''marchio'' by Charles in 915. He never\nappears as the Duke of Lorraine, but he was definitely the military commander of\nthe region under Charles. He himself was succeeded by his son Gilbert; however,\nthe Reginarids did not succeed in establishing their supremacy in Lotharingia\nlike the Liudolfings or Liutpoldings did in the duchies of Saxony and Bavaria.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Regnier_I,_Count_of_Hainaut","recorded":1364234568,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Regnier_I,_Count_of_Hainaut&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Count_of_Hainaut","/wiki/Gilbert,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Reginar_II,_Count_of_Hainaut","/w/index.php?title=Balderic,_Bishop_of_Utrecht&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frederick,_Archbishop_of_Mainz","#Titles_and_styles","/wiki/Nobility","/wiki/House_of_Reginar","/wiki/Gilbert,_Count_of_the_Maasgau","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Reginarids","/wiki/Gilbert,_Count_of_the_Maasgau","/wiki/Meuse_(river)","/wiki/Gau_(country_subdivision)","/wiki/Lothair_I","/wiki/Lay_abbot","/wiki/Echternach","/wiki/Maastricht","/wiki/Stablo","/wiki/Malmedy","/wiki/Count_of_Mons","/w/index.php?title=Franco,_Bishop_of_Li%C3%A8ge&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Bishop_of_Li%C3%A8ge","/wiki/Vikings","/wiki/Walcheren","/wiki/Hesbaye","/wiki/Count_of_Hainaut","/w/index.php?title=Radbold&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frisians","/wiki/Rollo_of_Normandy","/wiki/Capitulary","/wiki/Quierzy","/wiki/Charles_the_Bald","/wiki/Siege_of_Paris_(885-886)","/wiki/French_language","/wiki/Zwentibold","/wiki/Odo_of_France","/wiki/Charles_the_Simple","/w/index.php?title=Durfost&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Emperor_Arnulf","/wiki/Sankt_Goar","/wiki/Louis_the_Child","/wiki/Gebhard,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/w/index.php?title=Sigard,_Count_of_Hainaut&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Magyars","/wiki/Conrad_I_of_Germany","/wiki/Margrave","/wiki/Gilbert,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Liudolfings","/wiki/Liutpoldings","/wiki/Duchy_of_Saxony","/wiki/Duchy_of_Bavaria","/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Gilbert,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Reginar_II,_Count_of_Hainaut","/w/index.php?title=Balderic,_Bishop_of_Utrecht&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Frederick,_Archbishop_of_Mainz","/wiki/Berengar_of_Namur","/wiki/Count_of_Namur","/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Timothy_Reuter","http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/fulda.htm","/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&action=edit&section=3","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Reginar_III_of_Hainaut","/w/index.php?title=Reginar_II_of_Louvain&action=edit&redlink=1","#cite_ref-2","/wiki/Meerssen","/wiki/Counts_of_Hainaut","/w/index.php?title=Sigard,_Count_of_Hainaut&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Hagano,_Count_of_Hainaut&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Counts_of_Hainaut","/wiki/Regnier_II,_Count_of_Hainaut","/wiki/Gebhard,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Gilbert,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&oldid=544840917","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:House_of_Reginar","/wiki/Category:Counts_of_Hainaut","/wiki/Category:Dukes_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Category:850s_births","/wiki/Category:915_deaths","/wiki/Category:10th-century_rulers_in_Europe","/wiki/Category:Articles_containing_French_language_text","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reginar%2C+Duke+of+Lorraine&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Reginar%2C+Duke+of+Lorraine","/wiki/Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/wiki/Talk:Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine","#","/wiki/Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine","/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Reginar,_Duke_of_Lorraine&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:Wh
