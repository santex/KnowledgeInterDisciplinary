Their stability, comfort and ease of use makes them popular with\nbeginning bicyclists, casual riders and urban commuters.\n\nHybrids may integrate the flat handlebars, upright posture and brake system of a\nmountain bike. They may also have numerous accommodations for accessories (front\nand rear racks, water bottles, and fenders) typically found on a touring bike.\nMany also have the larger wheel diameter (e.g. 700c) and lighter componentry of\na road bike — and a rim/tire configuration that falls between the\nroad/touring bikes and mountain bikes.\n\nHybrid bikes have spawned numerous sub-categories satisfying diverse ridership.\nThey are classified by their design priorities, such as those optimized for\ncomfort or fitness — and those offered as city, cross or commuter\nbikes. {{cite book |last=Ballantine |first=Richard\n|authorlink = Richard Ballantine |title=Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book\n|year=2001 |publisher=Overlook Press |location=New York |isbn=1-58567-112-6\n|pages=32â39 }}\n","linknr":257,"url":"Hybrid_bicycle","recorded":1362543213,"links":18,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cycle types","Road cycles"],"headings":["Trekking bike","Cross bike","Commuter bike","City bike","Comfort bike","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/AERO-RS1-Trekking.jpg/220px-AERO-RS1-Trekking.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Hybrid-bicycle-1.jpg/220px-Hybrid-bicycle-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Racing_bicycle","Touring_bike","Mountain_bike","Bicycle_handlebar","Bicycle_brake_systems","Bicycle_tire","Bicycle_touring","Bicycle_frame","Racing_bicycle","Touring_bicycle","Cyclo-cross_bicycle","Cyclo-cross","Bicycle_wheel","Bicycle","European_city_bike","Derailleur_gears","Hub_gear","Bicycle_fork","Bicycle_suspension","Bicycle_handlebar"]}
