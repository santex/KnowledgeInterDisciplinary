Many salts are halides. All Group 1 metals form\nhalides which are white solids at room temperature.\n\nA 'halide ion' is a halogen atom bearing a negative charge. The halide anions\nare fluoride (F â ), chloride (Cl â ), bromide\n(Br â ), iodide (I â ) and astatide (At â ). Such\nions are present in all ionic halide salts.\n\nSee chloride, bromide, fluoride, and iodide\n","linknr":177,"url":"Halide","recorded":1362512809,"links":42,"instances":["chemistry","colour","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.indium.com/halogen-free/assets/PDF/Indium8_9HF_Overview.pdf"],"categories":["Salts","Halides|*"],"headings":["Tests","Uses","Compounds","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radical","chemistry"],["salt","chemistry"],["silver(i_fluoride"],["orange","colour"],["copper(ii_chloride"]],"members":["salt","orange","radical"],"related":["Binary_compound","Halogen","Atom","Chemical_element","Radical_(chemistry)","Electronegative","Fluoride","Chloride","Bromide","Iodide","Astatide","Salt_(chemistry)","Group_1_element","Anion","Fluoride","Chloride","Bromide","Iodide","Astatide","Ionic_bonding","Chloride","Bromide","Fluoride","Iodide","Potassium_chloride","Potassium_bromide","Potassium_iodide","Silver_nitrate","Precipitate","Silver(I)_fluoride","Silver_chloride","Silver_bromide","Silver_iodide","Beilstein_test","High-intensity_discharge_lamp","Metal_halide_lamp","Street_light","Energy_conversion_efficiency","Mercury-vapor_lamp","Colour_rendition","Orange_(colour)","Sodium-vapor_lamp","Greenhouse","Sunlight","Silver_halide","Photographic_film","Photographic_paper","Photographic_processing","Sodium_chloride","Potassium_chloride","Potassium_iodide","Lithium_chloride","Copper(II)_chloride","Silver_chloride","Calcium_chloride","Chlorine_fluoride","Organohalide","Bromomethane","Ioomfa","Salinity","Organohalide","Hydrogen_halide","Silver_halide"]}
