According to the\n[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), symptoms\nemerge before seven years of age. There are three subtypes\nof the disorder which consist of it being predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or\nADHD-I), predominantely hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-HI or ADHD-H), or the two\ncombined (ADHD-C). Oftentimes people refer to ADHD-PI as \"attention deficit\ndisorder\" (ADD), however, the latter has not been officially accepted since the\n1994 revision of the DSM. ADHD impacts school-aged children and results in\nrestlessness, acting impulsively, and lack of focus which impairs their ability\nto learn properly.\n\n It is the most commonly studied and diagnosed\npsychiatric disorder in children, affecting about 3 to 5 percent of children\nglobally and is diagnosed in about 2 to 16 percent of school-\naged children. It is a chronic disorder with 30 to 50\npercent of those individuals diagnosed in childhood continuing to have symptoms\ninto adulthood. Adolescents and adults with ADHD tend\nto develop coping mechanisms to compensate for some or all of their\nimpairments. It is estimated that 4.7\npercent of American adults live with ADHD.\nADHD is diagnosed two to four times more frequently in boys than in girls. Its symptoms\ncan be difficult to differentiate from other disorders, increasing the\nlikelihood that the diagnosis of ADHD will be missed.\nIn addition, most clinicians have not received formal training in the assessment\nand treatment of ADHD, in particular in adult patients.\nStandardized rating scales can be used for ADHD screening and assessment of the\ndisorder's symptoms' severity.\n\n ADHD management usually involves some combination of\nmedications, behavior therapy, lifestyle changes, and counseling. Only children\nwith severe ADHD symptoms should be considered for medication as a first-line\ntreatment option. Medication therapy can also be considered for those with\nmoderate ADHD symptoms who either refuse psychotherapeutic options or else fail\nto respond to psychotherapeutic input.\n\nADHD and its diagnosis and treatment have been considered controversial since\nthe 1970s. The controversies have involved\nclinicians, teachers, policymakers, parents and the media. Topics include ADHD's\ncauses, and the use of stimulant medications in its treatment. Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder with\ndebate in the scientific community centering mainly around how it is diagnosed\nand treated. The\nNational Institute for Clinical Excellence, while acknowledging the controversy,\nstates that the current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on the\ndominant view of the academic literature.\n","linknr":1847,"url":"ADHD","recorded":1362511118,"links":124,"instances":["medicine","drug","biology","tv_series","sense","medical","physiology","medicine","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf","http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200408/20040803sim.pdf","http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200408/20040803sim.pdf","http://psych.colorado.edu/~willcutt/pdfs/Willcutt_2005_BP.pdf","http://psych.colorado.edu/~willcutt/pdfs/Willcutt_2005_BP.pdf","http://pingpong.ki.se/public/pp/public_courses/course07292/published/0/resourceId/0/content/Nigg_etal_2005%20%28Thorell%29.pdf","http://pingpong.ki.se/public/pp/public_courses/course07292/published/0/resourceId/0/content/Nigg_etal_2005%20%28Thorell%29.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20091024102724/http://www.euro.who.int/document/MNH/ebrief14.pdf","http://www.euro.who.int/document/MNH/ebrief14.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20091024102724/http://www.euro.who.int/document/MNH/ebrief14.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080306234634/http://www.vera.org/publication_pdf/169_280.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080306234634/http://www.vera.org/publication_pdf/169_280.pdf","http://psychrights.org/research/Digest/NLPs/neruoimagingupdate.pdf","http://psychrights.org/research/Digest/NLPs/neruoimagingupdate.pdf","http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar11sep-13.pdf","http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar11sep-13.pdf","http://www.caddra.ca/cms4/pdfs/caddraGuidelines2011Chapter07.pdf","http://www.caddra.ca/cms4/pdfs/caddraGuidelines2011Chapter07.pdf","http://www.caddra.ca/cms4/pdfs/caddraGuidelines2011Introduction.pdf","http://www.caddra.ca/cms4/pdfs/caddraGuidelines2011Introduction.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20070621111922/http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2/content_storage_01/0000000b/80/22/94/d6.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_221.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_221.pdf","http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/ADHDFullGuideline.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/ADHDFullGuideline.pdf","http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110PDF.pdf","http://consensus.nih.gov/1998/1998AttentionDeficitHyperactivityDisorder110PDF.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/ADHDFullGuideline.pdf","http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/ADHDFullGuideline.pdf","http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/c7ad5e032528c34c4c2566690076db9b/4e1c3cddf420bcaecc256a8e007f12d9/$FILE/ADHDGuidelines.pdf"],"categories":["Attention","Attention
