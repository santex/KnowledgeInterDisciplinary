{"cursor":"13824","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n suit currently in development by Tsukuba University of Japan.]]\n\n'Human enhancement' refers to any attempt to temporarily or permanently overcome\nthe current limitations of the human body through natural or artificial means.\nThe term is sometimes applied to the use of technological means to select or\nalter human characteristics and capacities, whether or not the alteration\nresults in characteristics and capacities that lie beyond the existing human\nrange. Here, the test is whether the technology is used for non-therapeutic\npurposes. Some bioethicists restrict the term to the non-therapeutic application\nof specific technologies — neuro-, cyber-, gene-, and nano-technologies\n— to human biology.
