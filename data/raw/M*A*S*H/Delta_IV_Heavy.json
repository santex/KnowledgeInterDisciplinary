It was first launched in\n2004. [http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2004/q4/nr_041222m.html \"Boeing\nDelta IV Heavy Achieves Major Test Objectives in First Flight\"], Boeing, 2004,\naccessed March 22, 2012\n\nIt is similar to the Medium+ (5,2), except that it uses two additional CBCs\ninstead of using GEMs. These are strap-on boosters which are separated earlier\nin the flight than the center CBC. The Delta IV Heavy also features a stretched\n5-meter composite payload fairing.

[http://-\nwww.afspc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=3643 US Air Force - EELV\nFact Sheets] The first launch in 2004 was a test launch only. Its first\npayload was the DSP-23 satellite.\n\nCapacity (separated spacecraft mass) of the Delta IV Heavy: *Low Earth orbit\n(LEO) 22,950 kg  *geosynchronous transfer orbit\n(GTO) 13,130 kg (28,950 lb).\n*geosynchronous orbit (GEO) 6,275 kg *escape orbit 9,306 kg\n*C 3 performance of 30 km 2s â2 :\n5,228 kg *C 3 performance of\n60 km 2s â2 : 2,521 kg\n\nThe Heavy's total mass at launch is approximately 733,000 kg, much less\nthan that of the Space Shuttle (2,040,000 kg), but is not reused.\n\nThe Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle is planned for an unmanned test flight\nlaunch, known as EFT-1, aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket in 2014. If\nlaunched, it would be its first launch into orbit.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Delta_IV_Heavy","recorded":1362267970,"links":20,"instances":["rocket","rocket_family"],"pdf":["http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/delta/kits/d310_d4heavy_demo.pdf","http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/delta/kits/d310_d4heavy_demo.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/DeltaIVPayloadPlannersGuide2007.pdf","http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/product_cards/guides/DeltaIVPayloadPlannersGuide2007.pdf"],"categories":["Delta (rocket family)"],"headings":["Comparable Vehicles","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Delta_IV_Heavy_rocket_on_launch_pad.jpg/220px-Delta_IV_Heavy_rocket_on_launch_pad.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["angara","rocket_family"],["proton","rocket"]],"members":["proton","angara"],"related":["Delta_IV","Common_Booster_Core","Graphite-Epoxy_Motor","Titan_IV","Low_Earth_orbit","Geosynchronous_transfer_orbit","Geosynchronous_orbit","Escape_orbit","Characteristic_energy","Space_Shuttle","Orion_Multi-Purpose_Crew_Vehicle","Exploration_Flight_Test_1","Angara_(rocket_family)","Atlas_rocket","Falcon_Heavy","Proton_(rocket)","Titan_IV"]}
