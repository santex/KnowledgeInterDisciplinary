Members\nof the tribe are called 'hominins' (cf. Hominidae, \"hominids\"). The subtribe\nHominina is the \"human\" branch, including genus Homo. Researchers proposed the\ntaxon Hominini on the basis of the idea that the least similar species of a\ntrichotomy should be separated from the other two. Some earlier classification\nschemes include the genus [[Pan (genus)|Pan]] (chimpanzees) within the Hominini,\nbut this classification is now rarely followed. Sahelanthropus tchadensis is an\nextinct hominid species that lived 7 million years ago, very close to the time\nof the chimpanzee/human divergence; it is thus unclear whether it can be\nconsidered a member of the Hominini tribe.\n\nThrough DNA comparison, scientists believe the Pan/Homo divergence occurred\nbetween 5.4 and 6.3 million years ago, after an unusual process of speciation\nthat ranged over 4 million years. Few fossil specimens on\nthe Pan side of the split have been found, the first fossil chimpanzee discovery\nbeing published in 2005, dating to between 545 Â± 3 kyr\n(thousand years) and 284 Â± 12 kyr via Argon-argon dating, from Kenya's East\nAfrican Rift Valley. All of the extinct genera listed in the table to the right\nare ancestral to Homo, or are offshoots of such. However, both [[Orrorin]] and\n[[Sahelanthropus]] existed around the time of the split, and so may be ancestral\nto all three extant species.\n\nIn the proposal of Mann and Weiss (1996), the tribe\nHominini includes Pan as well as Homo, but within separate subtribes. Homo (and,\nby inference, all bipedal apes) is in the subtribe Hominina, while Pan is in the\nsubtribe Panina. Wood (2010) discusses the different views of this taxonomy.\n","linknr":298,"url":"Hominini","recorded":1362373300,"links":46,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Homininae","Human evolution"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Sahelanthropus_tchadensis_-_TM_266-01-060-1.jpg/230px-Sahelanthropus_tchadensis_-_TM_266-01-060-1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg/34px-Wikispecies-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tree_of_life.svg/16px-Tree_of_life.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Primatenskelett-drawing.jpg/100px-Primatenskelett-drawing.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tribe","biology"]],"members":["tribe"],"related":["Animal","Chordata","Mammal","Primate","Hominidae","Homininae","John_Edward_Gray","Genus","Hominina","Tribe_(biology)","Homininae","Chimpanzee","Hominidae","Subtribe","Hominina","Taxon","Trichotomy","Sahelanthropus_tchadensis","Hominid","Species","DNA","Speciation","Argon-argon_dating","Hominina","History_of_hominoid_taxonomy"]}
