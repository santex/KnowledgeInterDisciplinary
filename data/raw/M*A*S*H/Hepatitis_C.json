The infection is often\nasymptomatic, but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and\nultimately to cirrhosis, which is generally apparent after many years. In some\ncases, those with cirrhosis will go on to develop liver failure, liver cancer or\nlife-threatening esophageal and gastric varices.\n\nHCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous\ndrug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment and transfusions. An estimated\n130â200 million people worldwide are infected with . The existence of (originally \"non-A non-B hepatitis\")\nwas postulated in the 1970s and proven in 1989.\nonly infects humans and chimpanzees.\n\nThe virus persists in the liver in about 85% of those infected. This persistent\ninfection can be treated with medication: the standard therapy is a combination\nof peginterferon and ribavirin, with either boceprevir or telaprevir added in\nsome cases. Overall, 50â80% of people treated are cured. Those who develop\ncirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. is the leading cause\nof liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after\ntransplantation.
