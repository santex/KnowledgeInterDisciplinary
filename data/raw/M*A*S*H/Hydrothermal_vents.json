Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically\nactive places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and\nhotspots. Hydrothermal vents exist because the earth is both geologically active\nand has very large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common\nland types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. Under the sea,\nhydrothermal vents may form features called 'black smokers'. Relative to the\nmajority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are\nbiologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the\nchemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic archaea form the base of\nthe food chain, supporting diverse organisms, including giant tube worms, clams,\nlimpets and shrimp. Active hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's\nmoon Europa, and ancient hydrothermal vents have been speculated to exist on\nMars. {{cite web |last=Paine |first=M. |date=15 May 2001
