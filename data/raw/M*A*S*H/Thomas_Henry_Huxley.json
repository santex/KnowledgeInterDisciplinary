Huxley had been planning\nto leave Oxford on the previous day, but, after an encounter with Robert\nChambers, the author of [[Vestiges of the Natural History of\nCreation|Vestiges]], he changed his mind and decided to join the debate.\nWilberforce was coached by Richard Owen, against whom Huxley also debated\nwhether humans were closely related to apes.\n\nHuxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, such as gradualism, and was\nundecided about natural selection, but despite this he was wholehearted in his\npublic support of Darwin. He was instrumental in developing scientific education\nin Britain, and fought against the more extreme versions of religious tradition.\n\nIn 1869 Huxley coined the term 'agnostic' to describe his own views on theology,\na term whose use has continued to the present day (see Thomas Henry Huxley and\nagnosticism). Huxley T.H. 1889. Agnosticism: a rejoinder. In Collected\nEssays vol 5 Science and Christian tradition. Macmillan, London.\n\nHuxley had little formal schooling and taught himself almost everything he knew.\nHe became perhaps the finest comparative anatomist of the latter 19th\ncentury. Poulton E.B. 1909. Charles Darwin and the origin of species.\nLondon. He worked on invertebrates, clarifying relationships between\ngroups previously little understood. Later, he worked on vertebrates, especially\non the relationship between apes and humans. After comparing [[Archaeopteryx]]\nwith [[Compsognathus]], he concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous\ndinosaurs, a theory widely accepted today.\n\nThe tendency has been for this fine anatomical work to be overshadowed by his\nenergetic and controversial activity in favour of evolution, and by his\nextensive public work on scientific education, both of which had significant\neffects on society in Britain and elsewhere.
