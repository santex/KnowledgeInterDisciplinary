The center's mission is to advance knowledge and\nunderstanding of the universe through research and education in astronomy and\nastrophysics.\n\nThe center was founded in 1973 as a joint venture between the Smithsonian\nInstitution and Harvard University. It consists of the Harvard College\nObservatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. The center's main\nfacility is located between Concord Avenue and Garden Street, with its mailing\naddress and main entrance at 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Beyond\nthis location there are also additional satellite facilities elsewhere around\nthe globe. The current director of the CfA, Charles R. Alcock, was named in\n2004.  The director from 1982 to 2004 was Irwin I.\nShapiro.\n","linknr":226,"url":"Harvard-Smithsonian_Center_for_Astrophysics","recorded":1362371869,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Harvard University","Cambridge, Massachusetts","Astronomical observatories in Massachusetts","Astronomy institutes and departments","Research institutes in the United States","Astrophysics institutes","Telescopes","1973 establishments","Smithsonian Institution Archives related","Buildings and structures in Cambridge, Massachusetts","Smithsonian Institution research programs"],"headings":["Ground-based observatories","Space-based observatories","Plans","Directors","Funding sources","Trivia","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Center_for_Astrophysics.jpg/220px-Center_for_Astrophysics.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Charles_R._Alcock","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Massachusetts","United_States","Astronomy","Astrophysics","Earth_science","Space_science","Science_education","Universe","Smithsonian_Institution","Harvard_University","Harvard_College_Observatory","Smithsonian_Astrophysical_Observatory","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Charles_R._Alcock","Irwin_I._Shapiro","Fred_Lawrence_Whipple_Observatory","Magellan_telescopes","MMT_Observatory","South_Pole_Telescope","Submillimeter_Array","CfA_1.2_m_Millimeter-Wave_Telescope","VERITAS","Chandra_X-ray_Observatory","Hinode","Kepler_mission","Solar_Dynamics_Observatory","SOHO_spacecraft","Spitzer_Space_Telescope","Giant_Magellan_Telescope","Murchison_Widefield_Array","Square_Kilometer_Array","Pan-STARRS","Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope","Constellation-X_Observatory","George_B._Field","Irwin_I._Shapiro","Charles_R._Alcock","NASA","Smithsonian_Institution","National_Science_Foundation","United_States_Department_of_Energy","Annenberg_Foundation","Asteroid","10234_Sixtygarden"]}
