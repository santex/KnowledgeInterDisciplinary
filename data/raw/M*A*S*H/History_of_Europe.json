The\narrival of agriculture around 7000 BC ushered in the neolithic age. Neolithic\nEurope lasted for 4000 years, overlapping with metal-using cultures that\ngradually spread throughout the continent. Technological advances during the\nprehistoric age tended to arrive from the Middle East, spreading gradually to\nthe northwest. Some of the best-known civilizations of prehistoric Europe were\nMinoan and Mycenaean, which flourished during the Bronze Age until they\ncollapsed in a short period of time around 1200 BC.\n\nThe period known as classical antiquity began with the rise of the city-states\nof Ancient Greece. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire\nof Alexander the Great, spreading throughout Asia. Northern and western Europe\nwere dominated by the La TÃ¨ne culture, a precursor to the Celts. Rome, a small\ncity-state traditionally founded in 753 BC, would grow to become the Roman\nRepublic in 509 BC and would succeed Greek culture as the dominant Mediterranean\ncivilization. The events of the rule of Julius Caesar led to reorganization of\nthe Republic into the Roman Empire. The empire was later divided by the emperor\nDiocletian into the Western and Eastern empires. During the later years of the\nRoman Empire, the Germanic peoples of northern Europe grew in strength and\nrepeated attacks led to the Fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476, a date\nwhich traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the\nMiddle Ages.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern\nhistorians refer to this state as the Byzantine Empire. In Western Europe,\nGermanic peoples moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former\nWestern Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all\nof the Germanic peoples, the Franks would rise to a position of Hegemony over\nwestern Europe, the Frankish Empire reaching its peak under Charlemagne around\nAD 800. Francia was divided into several parts; West Francia would evolve into\nthe Kingdom of France, while East Francia would evolve into the Holy Roman\nEmpire, a precursor to modern Germany. The British Isles were the site of\nseveral large-scale migrations. Native Celtic peoples had been marginalized\nduring the period of Roman Britain, and when the Romans abandoned the British\nIsles during the 400s, waves of Germanic Anglo-Saxons migrated to southern\nBritain and established a series of petty kingdoms in what would eventually\ndevelop into the Kingdom of England by AD 927. During this period, the Kingdom\nof Poland and Kingdom of Hungary (1000â1945) were organized as well.\n\nThe Viking Age, a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, dominated the\nperiod from the late 700s to the middle 1000s. Chief among the Viking states was\nthe Empire of Cnut the Great, a Danish leader who would become king of England,\nDenmark, and Norway. The Normans, a Viking people who settled in Northern France\nand founded the Duchy of Normandy, would have a significant impact on many parts\nof Europe, from the Norman conquest of England to Southern Italy and Sicily.\nAnother Scandinavian people, the Rus' people, would go on to found Kievan Rus',\nan early state which was a precursor for the modern country of Russia. As the\nViking Age drew to a close, the period known as the Crusades, a series of religiously-\nmotivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the Levant back into\nChristian rule, began. Several Crusader states were founded in the eastern\nMediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound\nimpact on many parts of Europe. Their Sack of Constantinople in 1204 brought an\nabrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it\nwould never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes\nthat would develop into the Silk Road and open the way for the merchant\nrepublics of Genoa and Venice to become major economic powers. Crusader missions\nto the Baltic lands would establish the State of the Teutonic Order. The\nReconquista, a related movement, worked to reconquer Iberia for Christendom.\n\nEastern Europe in the High Middle Ages was dominated by the rise, and later\nfall, of the Mongol Empire. Led by Genghis Khan, the Mongols were a group of\nsteppe nomads that established a decentralized empire that, at its height,\nextended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic seas in Europe. The\nKievan Rus' state had broken up, replaced by several small warring states. In\nthe face of the Mongol conquests, many of these states paid tribute to the\nMongols, becoming effective vassals. As Mongol power waned towards the Late\nMiddle Ages, the Grand Duchy of Moscow rose to become the strongest of the\nnumerous Russian principalities and republics and would itself grow into the\nTsardom of Russia in 1547. The Late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval\nin Europe. The epidemic known as the Black Death and an associated famine caused\ndemographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic\nstruggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much\nof the period. In Scandinavia, the Kalmar Union dominated the political\nlandscape, while England fought with Scotland in the Wars of Scottish\nIndependence and with France in the Hundred Years' War. In Central Europe, the\nPolishâLithuanian union became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman\nEmpire, which was an elective monarchy, came to be dominated by the House of\nHabsburg, who would turn it into a hereditary position in all but name. Russia\ncontinued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands as well. In\nthe Balkans, the Ottoman Empire, a Turkish state originating in Anatolia,\nencroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the Fall of\nConstantinople in 1453.\n\nBeginning roughly in the 14th century in Florence, and later spreading through\nEurope with the development of the printing press, a Renaissance of knowledge\nchallenged traditional doctrines in science and theology, with the rediscovery\nof classical Greek and Roman knowledge. Simultaneously, the Protestant\nReformation under German Martin Luther questioned Papal authority. Henry VIII\nsundered the English Church, allying in ensuing religious wars between German\nand Spanish rulers. The Reconquista of Portugal and Spain led to a series of\noceanic explorations resulting in the Age of Discovery that established direct\nlinks with Africa, the Americas, and Asia, while religious wars continued to be\nfought in Europe, which ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia.\nThe Spanish crown maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on\nthe continent until the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, which ended a\nconflict between Spain and France that had begun during the Thirty Years' War.\nAn unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place\naround Europe and indeed the world in the 1610 to 1700 period. Observers at the\ntime, and many historians since, have argued that wars caused the\nrevolutions. Geoffrey Parker, \"States Make War But Wars Also Break\nStates,\"Journal of Military History (2010) 74#1 pp 11â34\n. The steam engine, fueled primarily by coal, propelled the Industrial\n  Revolution in Great Britain and the world.]] European overseas expansion led\n  to the rise of colonial empires, producing the Columbian Exchange.\n  The combination of resource inflows from the New World and the Industrial\n  Revolution of Great Britain, allowed a new economy based on manufacturing\n  instead of subsistence agriculture. Starting in 1775, British\n  Empire colonies in America revolted to establish a representative government.\n  Political change in continental Europe was spurred by the French Revolution\n  under the motto libertÃ©, egalitÃ©, fraternitÃ©. The ensuing French leader,\n  Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered and enforced reforms through war up to 1815.\n\nThe period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts\nand independence wars. In France and the United Kingdom, socialism and trade\nunions activity developed. The last vestiges of serfdom were abolished in Russia\nin 1861, and Balkan nations began to regain independence from the\nOttoman Empire. After the Franco-Prussian War, Germany and Italy unified into\nnation states, and most European states had become constitutional monarchies by\n1871. Rivalry in a scramble for empires spread. The outbreak of the First World\nWar was precipitated by a series of struggles among the Great Powers. War and\npoverty triggered the Russian Revolution which led to the formation of the\ncommunist Soviet Union. Hard conditions imposed on Germany by the Treaty of\nVersailles and the Great Depression led to the rise of fascism in Germany as\nwell as in Italy, Spain, and other countries. The rise of the irredentist\ntotalitarian regime Nazi Germany led to a Second World War.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War, Europe was divided by the Iron\nCurtain between American dominated non-socialist countries of Europe and Soviet\ndominated socialist countries of Europe. Most non-socialist European countries\ncame under US protection via NATO and formed the European Economic Community\namongst themselves. The Central-East was dominated by communist countries under\nthe Soviet Union's economic and military leadership, while the rest was\ndominated by capitalist countries under economic and military leadership of the\nUnited States. Both of the leading countries were superpowers. Portugal,\nbelonging to the part of Europe led by the US, remained linked to the idea of\nthe socialist state. There was, also a number of neutral, or Third World,\ncountries in between, including Finland, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Ireland, Austria\nand Switzerland. In late 1989, the Fall of Communism began in countries allied\nwith USSR: Poland, Hungary and Romania. The Soviet Union itself fell a little\nlater, in 1990â1991, and countries which had been Soviet republics became\nindependent. As a consequence Europe's economic integration deepened, the\ncontinent became depolarised and the European Union expanded to include many of\nthe formerly communist European countries, in 2004 and 2007.\n","linknr":2200,"url":"History_of_Europe","recorded":1371244071,"links":["/w/index.php?title=History_of_Europe&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=History_of_Europe&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/File:Abraham_Ortelius_Map_of_Europe.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Abraham_Ortelius_Map_of_Europe.jpg/300px-Abraham_Ortelius_Map_of_Europe.jpg","/wiki/File:Abraham_Ortelius_Map_of_Europe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Antwerp","/wiki/Abraham_Ortelius","/wiki/European_continent","/wiki/Prehistoric","/wiki/Homo_sapiens","/wiki/Prehistoric_Europe","/wiki/Paleolithic","/wiki/Neolithic_age","/wiki/Neolithic_Europe","/wiki/Minoan_civilization","/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece","/wiki/Bronze_Age","/wiki/Bronze_Age_collapse","/wiki/Classical_antiquity","/wiki/Ancient_Greece","/wiki/Alexander_the_Great","/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture","/wiki/Celts","/wiki/Founding_of_Rome","/wiki/Roman_Republic","/wiki/Julius_Caesar","/wiki/Roman_Empire","/wiki/Diocletian","/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Germanic_peoples","/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Middle_Ages","/wiki/Byzantine_Empire","/wiki/Franks","/wiki/Frankish_Empire","/wiki/Charlemagne","/wiki/West_Francia","/wiki/Kingdom_of_France","/wiki/East_Francia","/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire","/wiki/Roman_Britain","/wiki/Anglo-Saxons","/wiki/Kingdom_of_England","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Poland_(1025%E2%80%931385)","/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary","/wiki/Viking_Age","/wiki/Cnut_the_Great","/wiki/Normans","/wiki/Duchy_of_Normandy","/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England","/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_southern_Italy","/wiki/Rus%27_people","/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27","/wiki/Crusades","/wiki/Levant","/wiki/Crusader_states","/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(1204)","/wiki/Silk_Road","/wiki/Republic_of_Genoa","/wiki/Republic_of_Venice","/wiki/State_of_the_Teutonic_Order","/wiki/Reconquista","/wiki/Iberia","/wiki/High_Middle_Ages","/wiki/Mongol_Empire","/wiki/Genghis_Khan","/wiki/Steppe_nomad","/wiki/Mongol_conquests","/wiki/Tribute","/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages","/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow","/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia","/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages","/wiki/Black_Death","/wiki/Kalmar_Union","/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence","/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War","/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_union","/wiki/Elective_monarchy","/wiki/House_of_Habsburg","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Anatolia","/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople","/wiki/Florence","/wiki/Printing_press","/wiki/Renaissance","/wiki/Protestant_Reformation","/wiki/Martin_Luther","/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England","/wiki/Reconquista","/wiki/Age_of_Discovery","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia","/wiki/Spanish_crown","/wiki/Hegemony","/wiki/Treaty_of_the_Pyrenees","#cite_note-2","/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg/220px-Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg","/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf5/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Watt_steam_engine","/wiki/Steam_engine","/wiki/Colonial_empire","/wiki/Columbian_Exchange","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Industrial_Revolution","#cite_note-4","/wiki/British_Empire","/wiki/American_Revolution","/wiki/French_Revolution","/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte","/wiki/Serfdom","/wiki/Serfdom_in_Russia","#cite_note-5","/wiki/Balkan","/wiki/Ottoman_Empire","/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War","/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy","/wiki/First_World_War","/wiki/Great_Powers","/wiki/Russian_Revolution","/wiki/Soviet_Union","/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles","/wiki/Great_Depression","/wiki/Irredentist","/wiki/Totalitarian_regime","/wiki/Nazi_Germany","/wiki/Second_World_War","/wiki/Iron_Curtain","/wiki/NATO","/wiki/European_Economic_Community","/wiki/Socialist_state","/wiki/Third_World","/wiki/European_Union","#Prehistory","#Lepenski_Vir_.E2.80.93_Vin.C4.8Da_.E2.80.93_Cucuteni_cultures_7000.E2.80.932750_BC","#Minoans_and_Mycenae_2700.E2.80.931100_BCE","#Classical_antiquity","#Ancient_Greece","#The_rise_of_Rome","#Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire","#Late_Antiquity_and_Migration_Period","#Middle_Ages","#Byzantium","#Early_Middle_Ages","#Feudal_Christendom","#High_Middle_Ages","#A_divided_chur
