The state was named after the southern English county\n of Hampshire. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the\n west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of\n Quebec to the north. New Hampshire is the 5th smallest and the 9th least\n populous of the 50 United States.\n\nIt became the first of the British North American colonies to break away from\nGreat Britain in January 1776, and six months later was one of the original\nthirteen states that founded the United States of America. In June 1788, it\nbecame the ninth state to ratify the United States Constitution, bringing that\ndocument into effect. New Hampshire was the first U.S. state to have its own\nstate constitution.\n\nIt is known internationally for the New Hampshire primary, the first primary in\nthe U.S. presidential election cycle. Concord is the state capital, while\nManchester is the largest city in the state. It has no general sales tax, nor is\npersonal income (other than interest and dividends) taxed at either the state or\nlocal level. NH has a room and meals sales tax and a business profits income\ntax. Alaska does not have a statewide sales or income tax, but many Alaska towns\nhave a sales tax.\n\nIts license plates carry the state motto: \"Live Free or Die\". The state's\nnickname, \"The Granite State\", refers to its extensive granite formations and\nquarries.\n\nAmong prominent individuals from New Hampshire are founding father Nicholas\nGilman, Senator Daniel Webster, Revolutionary War hero John Stark, editor Horace\nGreeley, founder of the Christian Science religion Mary Baker Eddy, poet Robert\nFrost, astronaut Alan Shepard, and author Dan Brown. New Hampshire has produced\none president: Franklin Pierce.\n\nWith some of the largest ski mountains on the East Coast, New Hampshire's major\nrecreational attractions include skiing, snowmobiling and other winter sports,\nhiking and mountaineering, observing the fall foliage, summer cottages along\nmany lakes and the seacoast, motor sports at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway,\nand Motorcycle Week, a popular motorcycle rally held in Weirs Beach near Laconia\nin June. The White Mountain National Forest links the Vermont and Maine portions\nof the Appalachian Trail, and boasts the Mount Washington Auto Road, where\nvisitors may drive to the top of Mount Washington.\n","linknr":2126,"url":"New_Hampshire","recorded":1362372075,"links":210,"instances":["united_states","new_hampshire","united_states","new_hampshire","new_hampshire","united_states","writer","united_states","baseball","north_america","new_hampshire","common_law","new_hampshire","new_hampshire","new_hampshire","new_hampshire"],"pdf":["http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/dwgb/wrpp/documents/primer_chapter6.pdf","http://des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/dwgb/wrpp/documents/primer_chapter6.pdf","http://www.nh.gov/oep/programs/DataCenter/Geography/documents/popcenter.pdf","http://www.nh.gov/oep/programs/DataCenter/Geography/documents/popcenter.pdf","http://admin.state.nh.us/accounting/FY%2005/Monthly%20Rev%20June-05%20Cash%20Basis%20Unaud.pdf","http://admin.state.nh.us/accounting/FY%2005/Monthly%20Rev%20June-05%20Cash%20Basis%20Unaud.pdf","http://www.nh.gov/dot/programs/nhrta/documents/NHRTAGoals40-April18Reformat.pdf","http://www.nh.gov/dot/programs/nhrta/documents/NHRTAGoals40-April18Reformat.pdf","http://www.nhhistory.org/edu/support/nhlearnmore/nhedtimeline.pdf","http://www.nhhistory.org/edu/support/nhlearnmore/nhedtimeline.pdf"],"categories":["New
