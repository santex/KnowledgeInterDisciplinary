The term applies to\n electromagnetic radiation with frequencies between the high-frequency edge of\n the millimeter wave band, 300 gigahertz (3Ã10 11 Hz), and the\n low frequency edge of the far-infrared light band, 3000 GHz\n (3Ã10 12 Hz). Corresponding wavelengths of radiation in this band\n range from 1 mm to 0.1 mm (or 100 Î¼m)\n\nBecause terahertz radiation begins at a wavelength of one millimeter and\nproceeds into shorter wavelengths, it is sometimes known as the submillimeter\nband, and its radiation as submillimeter waves, especially in astronomy.\n\nTerahertz radiation occupies a middle ground between microwaves and infrared\nlight waves, and technology for generating and manipulating it is in its\ninfancy, and is a subject of active research. It represents the region in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum that the frequency of electromagnetic radiation becomes\ntoo high to be measured by directly counting cycles using electronic counters,\nand must be measured by the proxy properties of wavelength and energy. Similarly, in this frequency\nrange the generation and modulation of coherent electromagnetic signals ceases\nto be possible by the conventional electronic devices used to generate radio\nwaves and microwaves, and requires new devices and techniques.\n","linknr":415,"url":"THz","recorded":1362570829,"links":39,"instances":["electricity","physics","biology","telecommunications","unit","telescope"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electromagnetic spectrum","Terahertz technology"],"headings":["Introduction","Sources","Research","Wireless data transmission record","Terahertz versus submillimeter waves","Safety","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Spectre_Terahertz.svg/220px-Spectre_Terahertz.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Atmospheric_Microwave_Transmittance_at_Mauna_Kea_%28simulated%29.svg/350px-Atmospheric_Microwave_Transmittance_at_Mauna_Kea_%28simulated%29.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Atmospheric_terahertz_transmittance_at_Mauna_Kea_%28simulated%29.png/350px-Atmospheric_terahertz_transmittance_at_Mauna_Kea_%28simulated%29.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["line_of_sight","telecommunications"],["insulator","electricity"],["coherence","physics"],["blast","telescope"],["tissue","biology"],["tesla","unit"]],"members":["insulator","coherence","tissue","line_of_sight","tesla","blast"],"related":["Physics","Electromagnetic_wave","Frequency","Millimeter_wave","Gigahertz","Hertz","Far-infrared","Micro-","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Electromagnetic_radiation","Frequency_counter","Wavelength","Energy","Modulation","Infrared_radiation","Microwave_radiation","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Line_of_sight_(telecommunications)","Non-ionizing_radiation","Insulator_(electricity)","Paperboard","Masonry","Ceramic","Fog","Cloud","Earth's_atmosphere","Wireless_network","Coherence_(physics)","Gyrotron","Backward_wave_oscillator","Resonant-tunneling_diode","Black-body_radiation","Kelvin","Submillimetre_astronomy","Interstellar_medium","Starburst_galaxy","James_Clerk_Maxwell_Telescope","Caltech_Submillimeter_Observatory","Submillimeter_Array","Mauna_Kea_Observatory","BLAST_(telescope)","Herschel_Space_Observatory","Heinrich_Hertz_Submillimeter_Telescope","Mount_Graham_International_Observatory","Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array","Gyrotron","Backward_wave_oscillator","Far_infrared_laser","Quantum_cascade_laser","Free_electron_laser","Synchrotron_light","Photomixing","Terahertz_time_domain_spectroscopy","Photo-Dember","Resonant_tunneling_diode","Voltage","Electric_current","Terahertz_time-domain_spectroscopy","Tom_Clancy","Josephson_junction","Josephson_effect","Triboelectric_effect","X-ray","Tissue_(biology)","DNA","Density","Epithelial","3D_imaging","Tooth","Dentistry","Surveillance","Airport_security","Concealment_device","Weapon","Spectroscopy","Chemistry","Biochemistry","Terahertz_time_domain_spectroscopy","Tomography","Infrared","Absorbance","Laser","Tesla_(unit)","Larmor_frequency","Electron_paramagnetic_resonance","National_High_Magnetic_Field_Laboratory","Submillimetre_astronomy","Satellite","Manufacturing","Quality_control","Manufacturing_process_management","Paperboard","Packaging_and_labelling","Tokyo_Institute_of_Technology","Wireless","Proof_of_concept","Resonant_tunneling_diode","Voltage","Electric_current","Wi-Fi","Terahertz_time_domain_spectroscopy","DNA","Nonlinear_resonance","Gene_expression","Full_body_scanner","Heterojunction_bipolar_transistor","High_electron_mobility_transistor","Picarin","Xi-Cheng_Zhang","Derek_Abbott"]}
