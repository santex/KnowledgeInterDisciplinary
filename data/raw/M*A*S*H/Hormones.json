{"cursor":"13987","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n (adrenaline), a catecholamine-type hormone]] A 'hormone' (from Greek ,\n \"impetus\") is a chemical released by a cell, a gland, or an organ in one part\n of the body that sends out messages that affect cells in other parts of the\n organism. Only a little amount of hormone is required to alter cell metabolism.\n In essence, it is a chemical messenger that transports a signal from one cell\n to another. All multicellular organisms produce hormones; plant\n hormones are also called phytohormones. Hormones in animals are often\n transported in the blood. Cells respond to a hormone when they express a\n specific receptor for that hormone. The hormone binds to the receptor protein,\n resulting in the activation of a signal transduction mechanism that ultimately\n leads to cell type-specific responses.\n\nEndocrine hormone molecules are secreted (released) directly into the\nbloodstream, typically into fenestrated capillaries. Hormones with paracrine\nfunction diffuse through the interstitial spaces to nearby target tissues.\n\nA variety of exogenous chemical compounds, both natural and synthetic, have hormone-\nlike effects on both humans and wildlife. Their interference with the synthesis,\nsecretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the\nbody can change the homeostasis, reproduction, development, and/or behavior,\njust as endogenously produced hormones do.\n","linknr":532,"url":"Hormones","recorded":1362504321,"links":96,"instances":["biochemistry","menopause","biology","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hormones|*","Physiology","Endocrinology","Cell signaling","Signal transduction"],"headings":["Hormones as signals","Interactions with receptors","Physiology of hormones","Effects of hormones","Chemical classes of hormones","Pharmacology","Important human hormones","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Epinephrine_structure.svg/180px-Epinephrine_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["receptor","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["receptor","biochemistry"],["homology","biology"],["analog","chemistry"],["hormone_replacement_therapy","menopause"]],"members":["receptor","hormone_replacement_therapy","homology","analog"],"related":["Catecholamine","Greek_language","Metabolism","Multicellular_organism","Plant_hormone","Phytohormone","Animal","Gene_expression","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Protein","Signal_transduction","Endocrine_system","Molecule","Bloodstream","Paracrine","Interstitial","Exogenous","Chemical_compound","Endocrine_disruptor","Homeostasis","Endogenous","Membrane_protein","Intracellular","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Signal_transduction","Down-regulation","Homeostasis","Negative_feedback_loop","Endocrine_system","Thyroid_gland","Ovary","Testes","Exocytosis","Cell_membrane","Insulin","Intracellular","Membrane_protein","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Signal_transduction","Protein_hormone","Plasma_membrane","Cytoplasm","Phosphorylation","Ion_channel","Second_messenger","Cyclic_AMP","Protein_hormone","Intracellular","Cytoplasm","Cell_nucleus","Intracrine","Steroid_hormone","Thyroid_hormone","Intracellular","Cytoplasm","Protein_complex","DNA_sequences","Genes","Protein_synthesis","Intracellular","Plasma_membrane","Signal_transduction","Concentration","Signal_transduction","Endocrine_gland","Homeostasis","Negative_feedback","Metabolism","Excretion","Globulin","Neuron","Tropic_hormone","Endocrine_system","Thyroid-stimulating_hormone","Thyroid","Thyroid_hormone","Ghrelin","Orexin","PYY_3-36","Cholecystokinin","Leptin","Nesfatin-1","Obestatin","Circulatory_system","Prehormone","Prohormone","Mood_swings","Apoptosis","Immune_system","Metabolism","Mating","Fighting","Fleeing","Puberty","Parenting","Menopause","Reproductive_cycle","Sexual_arousal","Homeostasis","Vertebrate","Peptide_hormone","Thyrotropin-releasing_hormone","Vasopressin","Protein","Insulin","Growth_hormone","Carbohydrate","Glycoprotein","Luteinizing_hormone","Follicle-stimulating_hormone","Thyroid-stimulating_hormone","Lipid","Phospholipid","Linoleic_acid","Arachidonic_acid","Steroid_hormones","Cholesterol","Eicosanoid","Steroid_hormones","Testosterone","Cortisol","Sterol","Calcitriol","Homology_(biology)","Adrenal_cortex","Gonad","Eicosanoid","Prostaglandin","Monoamine","Amino_acid","Phenylalanine","Tyrosine","Tryptophan","Aromatic_amino_acid_decarboxylase","Enzyme","Analog_(chemistry)","Medication","Estrogen","Progestagen","Hormonal_contraception","Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)","Thyroxine","Levothyroxine","Hypothyroidism","Steroid","Autoimmune_disease","Pulmonology","Insulin","Diabetes_mellitus","Otolaryngology","Pharmacology","Adrenaline","Steroid","Vitamin_D","Dermatology","Glucocorticoid","Inflammation","Autocrine_signaling","Cytokine","Endocrinology","Endocrine_system","Growth_factor","Hormone_disruptor","Intracrine","Neuroendocrinology","Paracrine_signaling","Plant_hormones","Plant_growth_regulators","Sexual_motivation_and_hormones"]}
