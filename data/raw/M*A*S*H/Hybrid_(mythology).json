They can be classified as partly human hybrids (such as mermaids or\ncentaurs), and non-human hybrids combining two or more animal species (such as\nthe griffin). Hybrids are often zoomorphic deities in origin who acquire an\nanthropomorphic aspect over time.\n\nPartly human hybrids appear in petroglyphs or cave paintings from the Upper\nPaleolithic, in shamanistic or totemistic contexts. Ethnologist Ivar Lissner\ntheorized that cave paintings of beings combining human and animal features were\nnot physical representations of mythical hybrids, but were instead attempts to\ndepict shamans in the process of acquiring the mental and spiritual attributes\nof various beasts or \"power animals\". Religious\nhistorian Mircea Eliade has observed that beliefs regarding animal identity and\ntransformation into animals are widespread. The\niconography of the Vinca culture of Neolithic Europe in particular is noted for\nits frequent depiction of an owl-beaked \"bird goddess\". a term of Marija\nGimbutas', see e.g. The language of the goddess: unearthing the hidden symbols\nof western civilization San Francisco: Harper & Row; London: Thames and Hudson\n(1989).\n\nExamples of theriocephaly in the Ancient Egyptian pantheon include jackal-headed\nAnubis, cobra-headed Amunet, lion-headed Sekhmet (see also Sphinx), falcon-\nheaded Horus etc. Most of these deities also have a purely zoomorphic and a\npurely anthropomorphic aspect, both of which the hybrid representation seeks to\ncapture at once. The hybrid iconography then develops as an attempt to represent\nboth aspects. Similarly, the Gaulish [[Artio]] sculpture found in Berne shows a\njuxtaposition of a bear and a woman figure, interpreted as representations of\nthe theriomorphic and the anthropomorphic aspect of the same goddess.\n\nNon-human hybrids also appear in Ancient Egyptian iconography, as in Ammit\n(combining the crocodile, the lion and the hippopotamus). Mythological\nhybrids become very popular in Luwian and Assyrian art of the Late Bronze Age\nto Early Iron Age. The \"angel\" (human with birds' wings, see winged genie)\nthe \"mermaid\" (part human part fish, see Enki, Atargatis, Apkallu) and the\n(Shedu) all trace their origins to Assyro-Babylonian art. In Mesopotamian\nmythology the urmahlullu, or lion-man served as a guardian spirit, especially\nof bathrooms. The Old Babylonian Lilitu demon,\nparticularly as shown in the Burney Relief (part woman part owl) prefigures\nthe harpy/siren motive.\n\nLuwian and Assyrian motives are imitated in Archaic Greece, during the\nOrientalizing Period (9th to 8th centuries BC), inspiring the monsters of\nclassical Greek mythology such as the Chimera, the Harpy, the Centaur, the\nGriffin, the Hippocamp, Talos etc.\n\nThe motive of the \"winged man\" appears in the Assyrian winged genie, and is\ntaken up in the Biblical Seraphim and Chayot, the Etruscan Vanth, Hellenistic\nEros-Amor, and ultimately the Christian iconography of angels. Assyrian hybrids\nalso entered Persian art, as in the Faravahar or the Buraq.\n\nThe motive of otherwise human figures sporting horns may derive from partly goat\nhybrids (as in Pan and the Devil in Christian iconography) or as partly bull\nhybrids (Minotaur). The Gundestrup cauldron and the Pashupati figure have stag's\nantlers (see also Horned God, horned helmet). The Christian representation of\nMoses with horns, however, is due to a mistranslation of the Hebrew text of\nExodus 34:29-35 by Jerome.\n\nThe most prominent hybrid in Hindu iconography is elephant-headed Ganesha. Both\nNÄga and Garuda are non-hybrid mythical animals (snake and bird, respectively)\nin their early attestations, but become partly human hybrids in later\niconography.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Hybrid_(mythology)","recorded":1362543216,"links":18,"instances":["mythology","mythology","anatomy","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mythological hybrids|","Ancient Near East art and architecture","Animal worship"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Human_headed_winged_bull_profile.jpg/220px-Human_headed_winged_bull_profile.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Urmahlullu.jpg/220px-Urmahlullu.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Zeus_Typhon_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_596.jpg/220px-Zeus_Typhon_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_596.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chimera","mythology"],["horn","anatomy"],["pan","mythology"],["bull","mythology"]],"members":["bull","pan","horn","chimera"],"related":["Sargon_II","Dur-Sharrukin","Louvre","Ninevah","Typhon","Hydria","Staatliche_Antikensammlungen","Mythology","Mermaid","Centaur","Griffin","Zoomorphic","Petroglyph","Cave_painting","Upper_Paleolithic","Shamanism","Totemism","Power_animal","Mircea_Eliade","Shapeshifting","Vinca_culture","Neolithic_Europe","Bird_goddess","Marija_Gimbutas","Theriocephaly","Ancient_Egyptian_pantheon","Anubis","Amunet","Sekhmet","Sphinx","Horus","Gaul","Berne","Ammit","Luwian","Neo-Assyrian","Late_Bronze_Age","Early_Iron_Age","Winged_genie","Enki","Atargatis","Apkallu","Shedu","Mesopotamian_mythology","Lilitu","Burney_Relief","Harpy","Siren","Archaic_Greece","Orientalizing_Period","Greek_mythology","Chimera_(mythology)","Harpy","Centaur","Griffin","Hippocamp","Talos","Winged_genie","Seraphim","Chayot","Vanth","Eros","Amor","Angel","Persian_art","Faravahar","Buraq","Horn_(anatomy)","Goat","Pan_(mythology)","Devil","Bull_(mythology)","Minotaur","Gundestrup_cauldron","Pashupati","Stag","Antlers","Horned_God","Horned_helmet","Moses","Book_of_Exodus","Jerome","Hinduism","Ganesha","Nāga","Garuda","Animal_worship","Bestiary","Liminal_being","List_of_hybrid_creatures_in_mythology","Monster","Power_animal","Shapeshifting","Therianthropy","Theriocephaly","University_of_Zurich"]}
