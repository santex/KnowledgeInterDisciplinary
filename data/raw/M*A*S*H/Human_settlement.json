A settlement can therefore range in size from a small number of\n dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized\n areas. The term may include hamlets, villages, towns and cities.\n\nThe term is used internationally in the field of geospatial modeling, and in\nthat context is defined as \"a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of\nbuildings where people live and work\".\n\nA settlement conventionally includes its constructed facilities such as roads,\nenclosures, field systems, boundary banks and ditches, ponds, parks and woods,\nwind and water mills, manor houses, moats and\nchurches.
