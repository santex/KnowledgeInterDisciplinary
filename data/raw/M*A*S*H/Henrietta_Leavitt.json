A graduate of Radcliffe College, in 1893 Leavitt started\nworking at the Harvard College Observatory as a \"computer\", tasked with\nexamining photographic plates in order to measure and catalog the brightness of\nstars. Leavitt discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of\nCepheid variable stars. Though she received little recognition in her lifetime,\nit was her discovery that first allowed astronomers to measure the distance\nbetween the Earth and faraway galaxies. After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble used\nthe luminosity-period relation for Cepheids to determine that the Universe is\nexpanding (see Hubble's law).\n","recorded":1362124408,"portal":[],"list":[],"links":"185","instances":["writer","astronomy","astronomer","crater","astronomy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["American astronomers","19th-century astronomers","20th-century astronomers","Women astronomers","Harvard Computers","Harvard University staff","Astrometry","Cepheid variables|*","Deaf people","History of women in the United States","Radcliffe College alumni","People from Lancaster, Massachusetts","Leavitt family","American people of English descent","American Congregationalists","1921 deaths","1868 births","American women scientists","Human computers"],"headings":["Early years and education","Career","Influence","Illness and death","Awards and honors","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"tags":[["great_debate","astronomy"],["photometry","astronomy"],["leavitt","crater"],["tim_hunter","astronomer"],["great_debate","astronomy"],["photometry","astronomy"],["leavitt","crater"],["george_johnson","writer"],["tim_hunter","astronomer"]],"image":["http://en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leavitt_aavso.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Leavitt_aavso.jpg/185px-Leavitt_aavso.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering%27s_Harvard_computers.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering%27s_Harvard_computers.jpg/250px-Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering%27s_Harvard_computers.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Astronomer_Edward_Charles_Pickering%27s_Harvard_computers.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1777_Variables_in_the_Magellanic_Clouds_Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/1777_Variables_in_the_Magellanic_Clouds_Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt.png/200px-1777_Variables_in_the_Magellanic_Clouds_Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1777_Variables_in_the_Magellanic_Clouds_Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leavitt_henrietta_b1.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Leavitt_henrietta_b1.jpg/220px-Leavitt_henrietta_b1.jpg","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leavitt_henrietta_b1.jpg","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"related":["Lancaster,_Massachusetts","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","United_States","Astronomy","Harvard_University","Radcliffe_College","Oberlin_College","Cepheid","Astronomer","Radcliffe_College","Harvard_College_Observatory","Human_computer","Photographic_plate","Luminosity","Cepheid_variable","Galaxy","Edwin_Hubble","Hubble's_law","Congregational_church","Lancaster,_Massachusetts","Deacon","John_Leavitt","Puritan","Massachusetts_Bay_Colony","Oberlin_College","Radcliffe_College","Edward_Charles_Pickering","Annie_Jump_Cannon","Williamina_Fleming","Antonia_Maury","Harvard_College_Observatory","Harvard_Computers","Edward_Charles_Pickering","Photographic_plate","Variable_stars","Magellanic_Clouds","Cepheid_variable","Luminosity","Logarithm","Visible_spectrum","Cosmic_distance_ladder","Stellar_parallax","Ejnar_Hertzsprung","Milky_Way","Andromeda_Galaxy","Milky_Way","Great_Debate_(astronomy)","Edwin_Hubble","Gösta_Mittag-Leffler","Harlow_Shapley","Photometry_(astronomy)","Cambridge,_Massachusetts","Erasmus_Darwin_Leavitt,_Jr.","Henry_James","William_James","Phi_Beta_Kappa_Society","Solon_I._Bailey","Asteroid","5383_Leavitt","Leavitt_(crater)","Moon","Gösta_Mittag-Leffler","Nobel_Prize_in_Physics","Sofia_Kovalevskaya","Women_in_science","Astronomical_Society_of_the_Pacific","Tim_Hunter_(astronomer)","Lancaster,_Massachusetts","Cambridge,_Massachusetts"],"members":["george_johnson","great_debate","tim_hunter","leavitt","photometry"],"book":[]}
