This drawing shows\nboth the female (XX) and male (XY) versions of the 23rd chromosome pair.\nChromosomes are shown aligned at their centromeres. The mitochondrial DNA is\nnot shown.]]\n\nThe 'human' ([[Homo sapiens]]) '[[genome]]' is the complete set of human\ngenetic information, stored as DNA sequences within the 23 chromosome pairs of\nthe cell nucleus and in a small DNA molecule within the mitochondrion. The\nhaploid human genome (contained in egg and sperm cells) consists of three\nbillion DNA base pairs, while the diploid genome (found in somatic cells) has\ntwice the DNA content.\n\nAlthough the human genome has been completely read by DNA sequencing, it is not\nyet fully understood. Many (though probably not all) genes have been identified,\nyet much work still needs to be done to completely elucidate the biological\nfunctions of their protein and RNA products. Recent results indicate that most\nof the vast quantities of noncoding DNA within the genome have associated\nbiochemical activities, including regulation of gene expression, organization of\nchromosome architecture, and signals controlling epigenetic inheritance.\n\nThe Human Genome Project produced the first complete sequences of individual\nhuman genomes. As of 2012, thousands of human genomes have been completely\nsequenced, and many more have been mapped at lower levels of resolution. The\nresulting data are used worldwide in biomedical science, anthropology, forensics\nand other branches of science. There is a widely-held expectation that genomic\nstudies will lead to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and to\nnew insights in many fields of biology, including human evolution.\n\nThe haploid human genome contains approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes,\nsignificantly fewer than had been anticipated. [http://ww-\nw.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7011/full/nature03001.html] Protein-coding sequences account for only a very\nsmall fraction of the genome (approximately 1.5%), and the rest is associated\nwith non-coding RNA molecules, regulatory DNA sequences, introns, and sequences\nto which no function has yet been assigned.\n[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409860a0.html]\n","linknr":882,"url":"Human_genome","recorded":1362581392,"links":50,"instances":["human","human","human","human","human","human","human","classification_of_human_beings","human","biology","human","human","chimpanzee","human","human","human","genetics","human","human","human","human","human","human","human","dna","chimpanzee"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetic
