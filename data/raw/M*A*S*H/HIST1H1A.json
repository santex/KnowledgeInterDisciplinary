Two molecules\n| of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) form an octamer,\n| around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units, called\n| nucleosomes. The linker histone, H1, interacts with linker DNA between\n| nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order\n| structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H1\n| family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a\n| palindromic termination element. This gene is found in the large histone gene\n| cluster on chromosome 6.\n}}\n","linknr":217,"url":"HIST1H1A","recorded":1362481017,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":[],"headings":["References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/PBB_GE_HIST1H1A_208484_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_HIST1H1A_208484_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/DNA_stub.png/40px-DNA_stub.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Protein","Gene"]}
