Their eponymous television show ran from 1988 to\n1994 on CBC in Canada, and 1989 to 1995 on CBS and HBO in the United States. The\ntheme song for the show was the instrumental \"Having an Average Weekend\" by the\nCanadian band Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet. The troupe made one movie,\n[[Brain Candy]], which was released in 1996.\n\nThe name of the group came from Sid Caesar, who, if a joke didn't go over, or\nplayed worse than expected, would attribute it to \"the kids in the hall\",\nreferring to a group of young writers hanging around the\nstudio. For years this was erroneously attributed to Jack Benny,\nthough the Kids themselves offer a corrected version of the origin of the\ntroupe's name on the DVD release of the show's pilot episode.\n","linknr":685,"url":"The_Kids_In_The_Hall","recorded":1362566187,"links":24,"instances":["comedian","fiction","singer","sport","song","clothing","stereotype","director","tv_channel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["The
