Handbook of Mineralogy\n}}\n\n'Hydroxylapatite', also called 'hydroxyapatite' (HA), is a naturally occurring\nmineral form of calcium apatite with the formula\nCa 5(PO 4) 3(OH), but is usually written\nCa 10 (PO 4) 6(OH) 2 to denote that the\ncrystal unit cell comprises two entities. Hydroxylapatite is the hydroxyl\nendmember of the complex apatite group. The OH - ion can be replaced\nby fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite. It\ncrystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system. Pure hydroxylapatite powder is\nwhite. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or\ngreen colorations, comparable to the discolorations of dental fluorosis.\n\nUp to 50% of bone by weight is a modified form of hydroxylapatite (known as bone\nmineral). {{cite book |last= Junqueira |first= Luiz Carlos |coauthors= JosÃ©\nCarneiro |title= Basic Histology, Text & Atlas |edition= 10th |year= 2003\n|publisher= McGraw-Hill Companies |isbn=0-07-137829-4 |page= 144 |quote=\nInorganic matter represents about 50% of the dry weight of bone ... crystals\nshow imperfections and are not identical to the hydroxylapatite found in the\nrock minerals |editor1-last= Foltin |editor1-first= Janet |editor2-last=\nLebowitz |editor2-first= Harriet |editor3-last= Boyle |editor3-first= Peter J.\n|unused_data= editor1-last Foltin }}  Carbonated calcium-deficient\nhydroxylapatite is the main mineral of which dental enamel and dentin are\ncomposed. Hydroxylapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications\n(within the pineal gland and other structures) known as corpora arenacea or\n'brain sand'.\n","linknr":270,"url":"Hydroxylapatite","recorded":1362506215,"links":32,"instances":["matter","nutrition","crystal_system","mineralogy"],"pdf":["http://www.handbookofmineralogy.org/pdfs/hydroxylapatite.pdf"],"categories":["Calcium minerals","Phosphate minerals","Ceramic materials","Biomaterials"],"headings":["Medical uses","Chromatography","Use in archaeology","Animal structures","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Mineraly.sk_-_hydroxylapatit.jpg/240px-Mineraly.sk_-_hydroxylapatit.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Hydrogel-HA.jpg/120px-Hydrogel-HA.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["endmember","mineralogy"],["hexagonal","crystal_system"],["phase","matter"],["diet","nutrition"]],"members":["phase","diet","hexagonal","endmember"],"related":["Phosphate_mineral","Crystal","Hexagonal_crystal_system","Mineral","Apatite","Hydroxyl","Endmember_(mineralogy)","Apatite","Ion","Fluorine","Chlorine","Carbonate","Fluorapatite","Chlorapatite","Hexagonal_(crystal_system)","Crystal_system","Dental_fluorosis","Osseous_tissue","Bone_mineral","Dental_enamel","Dentin","Pineal_gland","Corpora_arenacea","Prosthesis","Phase_(matter)","Coral","Protein","Hip_replacement","Dental_implants","Osseointegration","Calcific_tendinitis","Calcium_carbonate","Noel_Fitzpatrick","Chromatography","Archaeology","Faunal_assemblage","Diet_(nutrition)","Micronutrients","Strontium","Carnivore","Herbivore","Omnivore","Groundwater","Collagen","Palaeolithic","Peacock_mantis_shrimp","Archaeological_science"]}
