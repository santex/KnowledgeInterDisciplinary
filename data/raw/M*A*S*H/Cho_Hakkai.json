He is called \"'Pigsy'\" or \"Pig\"\nin many English versions of the story.\n\nZhu Bajie is a complex and developed character in the novel. He looks like a\nterrible monster, part human and part pig, who often gets himself and his\ncompanions into trouble through his laziness, gluttony, and propensity for\nlusting after pretty women. He is jealous of Sun Wukong and always tries to\nbring him down.\n\nHis Buddhist name \"Zhu Wuneng\", given by Bodhisattva Guanyin, means \"pig\n(reincarnated) who is aware of ability,\" or \"pig who rises to power\", a\nreference to the fact that he values himself so much as to forget his own grisly\nappearance. Xuanzang gave him the nickname BÄjiÃ¨ which means \"eight restraints,\nor eight commandments\" to remind him of his Buddhist diet.\n\nIn the original Chinese novel, he is often called dÄizi (åå­), meaning \"idiot\".\nSun Wukong, Xuanzang and even the author consistently refers to him as \"the\nidiot\" over the course of the story. Bodhisattvas and other heavenly beings\nusually refer to him as \"Heavenly Tumbleweed\", his former name when he was a\nheavenly marshal.\n","linknr":281,"url":"Cho_Hakkai","recorded":1362890969,"links":31,"instances":["fictional_character","tool","mythology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chinese mythology","Fictional monks","Fictional pigs","Mythological pigs","Journey to the West characters","Literary characters","Fictional Buddhist monks","Monomyths"],"headings":["Character","Preexistence","Nine-toothed rake","Personality","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Zhongwen.svg/40px-Zhongwen.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Xiyou2.PNG/250px-Xiyou2.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/%E5%A4%A9%E7%AF%B7%E5%85%83%E5%B8%A5%28tian_peng_yuan_shuai%29.jpeg/220px-%E5%A4%A9%E7%AF%B7%E5%85%83%E5%B8%A5%28tian_peng_yuan_shuai%29.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/%E8%B1%AC%E5%85%AB%E6%88%92%E6%96%AC%E5%A6%96.jpg/220px-%E8%B1%AC%E5%85%AB%E6%88%92%E6%96%AC%E5%A6%96.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/111225174520b161aaa10ba7c8.jpeg/220px-111225174520b161aaa10ba7c8.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["xuanzang","fictional_character"],["chang'e","mythology"],["rake","tool"]],"members":["xuanzang","rake"],"related":["Xuanzang_(fictional_character)","English_language","Human","Pig","Sun_Wukong","Bodhisattva","Guan_Yin","Satori","Chang'e_(mythology)","Jade_Emperor","Buddhahood","Arhat","Nine-toothed_Rake","Rake_(tool)","Taoism","道法会元","Ming_Dynasty","Constellations","Northern_Pole","Sun_Wukong","Sun_Wukong","Xuanzang","Optimistic","Monkey_King","Proverb","Tang_Empire","List_of_media_adaptations_of_Journey_to_the_West"]}
