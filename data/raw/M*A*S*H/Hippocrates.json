He is referred to as the father of western\nmedicine  in recognition of his lasting\ncontributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine.\nThis intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing\nit as a discipline distinct from other fields that it had traditionally been\nassociated with (notably theurgy and philosophy), thus establishing medicine as\na profession.\n\nHowever, the achievements of the writers of the Corpus, the practitioners of\nHippocratic medicine, and the actions of Hippocrates himself are often\ncommingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought,\nwrote, and did. Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the of the ancient\nphysician, credited with coining the Hippocratic Oath, still relevant and in use\ntoday. He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of\nclinical medicine, summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and\nprescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other\nworks.\n","linknr":1095,"url":"Hippocrates","recorded":1362502028,"links":130,"instances":["orthopedics","lunar_crater","medicine","medicine","physician","mythology","greek","medical","epidemiology","physician","translator","physician","physician","medical"],"pdf":["http://www.caluniv.ac.in/Global%20mdia%20journal/Past_Issue/GMJ%20Issue%20-%20Summer%202007.pdf","http://www.caluniv.ac.in/Global%20mdia%20journal/Past_Issue/GMJ%20Issue%20-%20Summer%202007.pdf"],"categories":["460
