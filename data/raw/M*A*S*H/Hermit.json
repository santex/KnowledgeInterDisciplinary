([[Bartolomeo Cavarozzi|Cavarozzi]], early 17th century)]]\n\nA 'hermit' (adjectival form: 'eremitic' or 'hermitic' ) is a person who lives,\nto some degree, in seclusion from\nsociety. [http://www.nytimes.com/keyword/hermit New York Times]\n\nIn Christianity, the term was originally applied to a Christian who lives the\neremitic life out of a religious conviction, namely the Desert Theology of the\nOld Testament (i.e., the forty years wandering in the desert ,  that\nwas meant to bring about a change of heart).\n\nIn the Christian tradition the eremitic life Marina Miladinov, Margins of\nSolitude: Eremitism in Central Europe between East and West (Zaghreb: Leykam\nInternational, 2008) is an early form of monastic living that preceded the\nmonastic life in the cenobium. The Rule of St Benedict (ch. 1) lists hermits\namong four kinds of monks. In the Roman Catholic Church, in addition to hermits\nwho are members of religious institutes, contemporary Roman Catholic Church law\n(canon 603) recognizes also consecrated hermits under the direction of their\ndiocesan bishop as members of the Consecrated Life (\"consecrated diocesan\nhermits\"). The same is true in many parts of the Anglican Communion, including\nthe Episcopal Church in the US, although in the canon law of the Episcopal\nChurch they are referred to as \"solitaries\" rather than \"hermits\".\n\nOften, both in religious and secular literature, the term \"hermit\" is also used\nloosely for any Christian living a prayer-focused life, and sometimes\ninterchangeably with anchorite/anchoress, recluse and \"solitary\". Other\nreligions, for example, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, (Sufism) and Taoism, also\nhave hermits in the sense of individuals living an ascetic form of life.\n\nIn modern colloquial usage, the term \"hermit\" denotes anyone living a life apart\nfrom the rest of society, or who simply does not participate in social events as\nmuch as is common, regardless of their motivation in doing so, including the\nmisanthrope.\n","linknr":541,"url":"Hermit","recorded":1362670067,"links":61,"instances":["literature","religious_retreat","fictional_philosopher","virtue","heroic_literature","united_states","fairy_tale","fantasy","canton","nutrition","poet","catholic_church"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Hermits|*","Religious
