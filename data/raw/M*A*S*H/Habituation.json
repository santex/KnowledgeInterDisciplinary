As a procedure, habituation is the repeated\npresentation of an eliciting stimulus that results in the decline of the\nelicited behavior (the process of habituation). For example, a medical student\nfinding the shock of treating a cut to decrease after multiple presentations is\nexperiencing the process of habituation. The opposite is the process of\nsensitization, an increase of the elicited behavior from repeated presentation\nof a stimulus. There may also be an initial increase followed by a decline of\nthe elicited behavior (a sensitization process followed by a habituation\nprocess). Domjan, M. (2010).

Another related phenomenon\nis stimulus generalization, when habituation occurs in response to other stimuli\nthat are similar to the original stimulus. The\nopposing process, stimulus discrimination, is when habituation does not occur to\nother stimuli that are dissimilar to the original stimulus. A progressive\ndecline of a behavior in a habituation procedure may also reflect nonspecific\neffects such as fatigue, which must be ruled out when the interest is in\nhabituation as a learning process.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Habituation","recorded":1362672367,"links":51,"instances":["animals","medical","animals"],"pdf":["http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/48/14443312/1444331248-20.pdf","http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/48/14443312/1444331248-20.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBNK.pdf","http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBNK.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1979/A1979HF82000001.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1979/A1979HF82000001.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980KM40400001.pdf","http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980KM40400001.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/ntblab/pdfs/Turk-Browne_FHN_2008.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/ntblab/pdfs/Turk-Browne_FHN_2008.pdf"],"categories":["Behavioral concepts","Learning"],"headings":["History of the term","Characteristics of habituation","Examples of the habituation process in animals and humans","Theories of habituation","Biological mechanisms of habituation","Uses of the habituation procedure","Neuroimaging of habituation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fatigue","medical"],["consumer_demand_tests","animals"],["preference_tests","animals"]],"members":["consumer_demand_tests","fatigue","preference_tests"],"related":["Sensitization","Fatigue_(medical)","Neuroplasticity","Learning","Classical_conditioning","Operant_conditioning","Neural_adaptation","Substance_dependence","Associative_learning","Richard_F._Thompson","Interstimulus_interval","Orienting_response","Aplysia_gill_and_siphon_withdrawal_reflex","Positron_emission_tomography","FMRI","Aplysia","Consumer_demand_tests_(animals)","Hedonic_adaptation","Neural_adaptation","Konrad_Lorenz","Preference_tests_(animals)","Tachyphylaxis"]}
