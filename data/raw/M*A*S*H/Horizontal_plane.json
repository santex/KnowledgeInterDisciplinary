{"cursor":"6049","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn geometry, physics, astronomy, geography, and related sciences, a '[[plane\n(mathematics)|plane]]' is said to be 'horizontal' at a given point if it is\nperpendicular to the gradient of the gravity field at that point— in other\nwords, if apparent gravity makes a plumb bob hang perpendicular to the plane at\nthat point. Alternatively, a spirit level, which exploits the buoyancy of a\nbubble, can be used to determine if the plane is horizontal.\n\nIn radio science, 'horizontal plane' is used to plot an antenna's relative field\nstrength in relation to the ground (which directly affects a station's coverage\narea) on a polar graph. Normally the maximum of 1.000 or 0 dB is at the top,\nwhich is labeled 0 o, running clockwise back around to the top at\n360Â°. Other field strengths are expressed as a decimal less than 1.000, a\npercentage less than 100%, or decibels less than 0 dB. If the graph is of an\nactual or proposed installation, rotation is applied so that the top is\n0 o true north. See also the perpendicular vertical plane.\n\nIn general, something that is horizontal can be drawn from left to right (or\nright to left), such as the x-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n","linknr":136,"url":"Horizontal_plane","recorded":1362897291,"links":32,"instances":["fictitious","electronics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Geodesy"],"headings":["Discussion","Practical use in daily life","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Bubble_on_a_marble_shelf.PNG/220px-Bubble_on_a_marble_shelf.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Verticals_at_separate_points.PNG/220px-Verticals_at_separate_points.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Gravitational_field_due_to_knobbly_planet.PNG/220px-Gravitational_field_due_to_knobbly_planet.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["field","physics"],["antenna","electronics"],["centrifugal_force","fictitious"]],"members":["centrifugal_force","antenna","field"],"related":["Geometry","Physics","Astronomy","Geography","Gradient","Gravitation","Field_(physics)","Radio","Antenna_(electronics)","Field_strength","Polar_coordinate_system","Decibel","Rotation","True_north","Vertical_plane","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Vertical_direction","Earth","Density","Time","Spirit_level","Tide","Sun","Centrifugal_force_(fictitious)","Fictitious_force","Inertial_frame_of_reference","Orders_of_magnitude","Technical_drawing","Vertical_plane","Transverse_plane"]}
