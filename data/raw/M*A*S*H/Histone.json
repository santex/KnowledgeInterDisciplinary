{"cursor":"51022","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn biology, 'histones' are highly alkaline proteins found in eukaryotic cell\nnuclei that package and order the DNA into structural units called\nnucleosomes. They are\nthe chief protein components of chromatin, acting as spools around which DNA\nwinds, and play a role in gene regulation. Without histones, the unwound DNA in\nchromosomes would be very long (a length to width ratio of more than 10 million\nto one in human DNA). For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA,\nbut wound on the histones it has about 90 micrometers (0.09Â mm) of\nchromatin, which, when duplicated and condensed during mitosis, result in about\n120 micrometers of chromosomes.\n","linknr":1042,"url":"Histone","recorded":1362502988,"links":57,"instances":["biology","biology","protein_and_supramolecular"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Epigenetics","Genetics","Proteins"],"headings":["Classes","Structure","History","Conservation across species","Function","Functions of histone modifications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Nucleosome_structure.png/300px-Nucleosome_structure.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Protein_H2AFJ_PDB_1aoi.png/220px-Protein_H2AFJ_PDB_1aoi.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/PBB_Protein_HIST1H1B_image.jpg/220px-PBB_Protein_HIST1H1B_image.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Methyl_lysine.tif/lossy-page1-450px-Methyl_lysine.tif.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Methyl_arginine.tif/lossy-page1-519px-Methyl_arginine.tif.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Acetyl_lysine.tif/lossy-page1-194px-Acetyl_lysine.tif.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Amino_acid_phosphorylations.tif/lossy-page1-788px-Amino_acid_phosphorylations.tif.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["salt_bridge","protein_and_supramolecular"],["nucleus","biology"],["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["transcription","genetics#initiation"],["transcription","genetics#elongation"]],"members":["nucleus","transcription","cell","salt_bridge"],"related":["Biology","Protein","Eukaryote","DNA","Nucleosome","Chromatin","Gene_regulation","Mitosis","Chromosome","Protein_Data_Bank","H2AFJ","Protein_Data_Bank","HIST1H1B","Nucleosome","Base_pairs","DNA","Nucleosome","DNA","DNA","Chromatin","Chromosome","Histone_H1","H1F0","H1FNT","H1FOO","H1FX","HIST1H1A","HIST1H1B","HIST1H1C","HIST1H1D","HIST1H1E","HIST1H1T","Histone_H2A","H2AFB1","H2AFB2","H2AFB3","H2AFJ","H2AFV","H2AFX","H2AFY","H2AFY2","H2AFZ","HIST1H2AA","HIST1H2AB","HIST1H2AC","HIST1H2AD","HIST1H2AE","HIST1H2AG","HIST1H2AI","HIST1H2AJ","HIST1H2AK","HIST1H2AL","HIST1H2AM","HIST2H2AA3","HIST2H2AC","Histone_H2B","H2BFM","H2BFS","H2BFWT","HIST1H2BA","HIST1H2BB","HIST1H2BC","HIST1H2BD","HIST1H2BE","HIST1H2BF","HIST1H2BG","HIST1H2BH","HIST1H2BI","HIST1H2BJ","HIST1H2BK","HIST1H2BL","HIST1H2BM","HIST1H2BN","HIST1H2BO","HIST2H2BE","Histone_H3","HIST1H3A","HIST1H3B","HIST1H3C","HIST1H3D","HIST1H3E","HIST1H3F","HIST1H3G","HIST1H3H","HIST1H3I","HIST1H3J","HIST2H3C","HIST3H3","Histone_H4","HIST1H4A","HIST1H4B","HIST1H4C","HIST1H4D","HIST1H4E","HIST1H4F","HIST1H4G","HIST1H4H","HIST1H4I","HIST1H4J","HIST1H4K","HIST1H4L","HIST4H4","Nucleosome","Protein_dimer","Symmetry","Tertiary_structure","Point_groups_in_three_dimensions","Macromolecule","Evolution","Amino_acid","Electron_paramagnetic_resonance","Alpha_helix","Phosphate","Hydrogen_bonds","Deoxyribose","Salt_bridge_(protein_and_supramolecular)","Lysine","Arginine","Methylation","Citrullination","Acetylation","Phosphorylation","SUMO_protein","Ubiquitin","ADP-ribosylation","Gene","Interphase","Evolution","Mutations","Lysine","Arginine","Albrecht_Kossel","Mark_Ptashne","Michael_Grunstein","Histone_code","Nucleus_(biology)","Eukaryote","Cell_(biology)","Archaea","Euryarchaeota","Bacteria","Protamines","Centromere","Heterochromatin","DNA_repair","Genome","Posttranslational_modification","DNA","Nucleosome","Covalent","Methylation","Acetylation","Phosphorylation","Ubiquitination","SUMOylation","Citrullination","Histone_code","Gene_regulation","DNA_repair","Mitosis","Spermatogenesis","Meiosis","Amino_acid","Lysine","Methyl","Phosphate","Acetyl","Ubiquitin","N-terminal","Methylation","Gene_activation","Gene_repression","Acetylation","Histone_code","Phosphorylation","Transcription_(genetics)","RNA_polymerase_II","Phosphorylation","RNA_polymerase_II","Polycomb","Polycomb","Heterochromatin","RNA-induced_transcriptional_silencing","Centromeric","Histone_methyltransferase","Heterochromatin_protein_1","Histone_deacetylases","Histone_methyltransferases","Heterochromatin_protein_1","H2AX","DNA_double_strand_breaks","Nucleosome","Chromatin","Histone-Modifying_Enzymes","Histone_deacetylase","PRMT4_pathway","Gene_silencing","Genetics","HIstome","Histone_methyltransferase","Histone_acetyltransferase","The_Proteolysis_Map"]}
