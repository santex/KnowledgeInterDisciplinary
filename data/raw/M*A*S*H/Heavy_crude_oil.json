Some\npetroleum geologists categorize bitumen from oil sands as extra heavy crude oil\ndue to the density of less than 10 Â°API. Other classifications label this as\nbitumen differing it from extra-heavy oil. They differ in the degree by which\nthey have been degraded from the original crude oil by bacteria and erosion.\nOften, bitumen is present as a solid and does not flow at ambient conditions.\n\nThe largest reserves of heavy crude oil in the world are located north of the\nOrinoco river in Venezuela, Energy Information Administration (2001)\n\"Venezuela Offers Full Market Value to Encourage Foreign Investment in Oil\"\n[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/finance/usi&to/upstream/venezuela.html] the\nsame amount as the conventional oil reserves of Saudi Arabia, M.

Generally, a diluent is added at regular\ndistances in a pipeline carrying heavy crude to facilitate its flow.\n","linknr":456,"url":"Heavy_crude_oil","recorded":1362666429,"links":31,"instances":["chemistry","oil_industry"],"pdf":["http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/pdfs/RPT_Chops_app3.pdf","http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/OilSands/pdfs/RPT_Chops_app3.pdf","http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser_2010_report_1.pdf","http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser_2010_report_1.pdf","http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2009/3028/pdf/FS09-3028.pdf","http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2009/3028/pdf/FS09-3028.pdf","http://www.energy.alberta.ca/OilSands/pdfs/RPT_Chops_app3.pdf","http://www.laohamutuk.org/Oil/Power/NTNHeavyOilMar09.pdf","http://www.cpchem.com/enu/docs_drilling/heavyoils.pdf"],"categories":["Unconventional oil"],"headings":["Economics","Extraction","Environmental impact","Geological origin","Chemical properties","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["steam_injection","oil_industry"],["cracking","chemistry"],["steam_injection","oil_industry"]],"members":["cracking","steam_injection"],"related":["Crude_oil","Density","Specific_gravity","Light_crude_oil","API_gravity","Viscosity","Specific_gravity","Centipoise","World_Energy_Council","Dense_non-aqueous_phase_liquid","Oil_sands","Petroleum_geology","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Orinoco_river","Venezuela","Conventional_oil","Saudi_Arabia","Diluent","USGS","Orinoco_Belt","Refining","Reservoir_engineering","Canada","Venezuela","California","Society_of_Exploration_Geophysicists","Oil_well","Cold_heavy_oil_production_with_sand","Steam_assisted_gravity_drainage","Steam_injection_(oil_industry)","Vapor_extraction","Open-pit_mining","Enhanced_oil_recovery","Sulfur","Vanadium","Nickel","Petroleum_refining","Cracking_(chemistry)","Fractional_distillation","Biodegradation","Petroleum_geochemistry","Pleistocene","Pliocene","Miocene","Cretaceous","Mississippian","Devonian","Asphalt","Asphaltenes","Resins","Aromatics","Cycloalkanes","Alkane","Nitrogen","Sulfur","Oxygen","Heavy_metals","Viscosity","Poise","Pascal_second","Chevron_Phillips","Chevron_Phillips","Sulfur","Aromatics","Asphaltenes","North_America","Canada","Alberta","Saskatchewan","United_States","California","Mexico","South_America","Venezuela","Colombia","Ecuador","Middle_East","Kuwait","Saudi_Arabia","Sulfur","Aromatics","Naphthenes","Resins","Western_Africa","Chad","Central_Africa","Angola","East_Africa","Madagascar","Bitumen","Oil_shale","Oil_sands","Mazut","Steam_injection_(oil_industry)"]}
