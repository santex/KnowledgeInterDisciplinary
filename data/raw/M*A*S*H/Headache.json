It can be a symptom of a number of different conditions of the head and\nneck. The brain tissue itself is not sensitive to pain because it\nlacks pain receptors. Rather, the pain is caused by disturbance of the pain-\nsensitive structures around the brain. Nine areas of the head and neck have\nthese pain-sensitive structures, which are the cranium (the periosteum of the\nskull), muscles, nerves, arteries and veins, subcutaneous tissues, eyes, ears,\nsinuses and mucous membranes.\n\nThere are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most\nwell-recognized is that of the International Headache Society. Headache is a non-\nspecific symptom, which means that it has many possible causes. Treatment of a\nheadache depends on the underlying etiology or cause, but commonly involves\nanalgesics.\n","linknr":1120,"url":"Headache","recorded":1362485539,"links":97,"instances":["biology","menopause","mood","symptom"],"pdf":["http://216.25.100.131/ihscommon/guidelines/pdfs/ihc_II_main_no_print.pdf","http://216.25.100.131/ihscommon/guidelines/pdfs/ihc_II_main_no_print.pdf"],"categories":["Headaches|","Symptoms and signs"],"headings":["Classification","Cause","Pathophysiology","Diagnosis approach","Treatment","Epidemiology","History","Children","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Migraine.jpg/220px-Migraine.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Image-Lottie_Collins_sings_and_dances_to_the_tunes_of_Ta-Ra-Ra_Boom-de-ay_in_a_Bromo-Seltzer_ad.jpg/220px-Image-Lottie_Collins_sings_and_dances_to_the_tunes_of_Ta-Ra-Ra_Boom-de-ay_in_a_Bromo-Seltzer_ad.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Cruikshank_-_The_Head_Ache.png/220px-Cruikshank_-_The_Head_Ache.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stress","biology"],["aura","symptom"],["hormone_replacement_therapy","menopause"],["stress","biology"],["depression","mood"]],"members":["stress","hormone_replacement_therapy","depression","aura"],"related":["Pain","Head","Neck","Symptom","Brain_tissue","Nociceptors","Pericranium","Muscles","Nerves","Arteries","Veins","Subcutaneous_tissue","Human_eyes","Ears","Sinuses","Mucous_membranes","International_Headache_Society","Non-specific_symptom","Etiology","Analgesics","International_Headache_Society","WHO","National_Institutes_of_Health","International_Classification_of_Headache_Disorders","Hierarchical","International_Headache_Society","Diagnostic_criteria","Human_cranium","Neuralgia","Migraine","Trigeminal","Cough","Coital_cephalalgia","Symptoms","Whiplash_injury","Intracranial_hematoma","Transient_ischemic_attack","Cerebral_arteriovenous_malformation","Arteritis","Cerebral_venous_thrombosis","Epileptic_seizure","Central_nervous_system","HIV","AIDS","Infections","Dialysis","High_blood_pressure","Hypothyroidism","Fasting","Teeth","Temporomandibular_joint","Somatization","Psychotic_disorders","Neuralgia","Myogenic","Neurological_examination","Tension_headache","Migraine","Nausea","Trigeminal_neuralgia","Cluster_headache","Hemicrania_continua","Medication_overuse_headache","Thunderclap_headache","Paresis","Neurological_examination","Mental_confusion","Valsalva_manoeuvre","Visual_loss","Meningism","Fever","HIV","Cancer","Thrombosis","Subarachnoid_hemorrhage","Stroke","Intracranial_berry_aneurysm","Meningitis","Encephalitis","Virus","Intracranial_pressure","Brain_tumor","Idiopathic_intracranial_hypertension","Cerebral_venous_sinus_thrombosis","Stroke","Intracranial_hemorrhage","Subdural_hematoma","Giant_cell_arteritis","Vasculitis","Carbon_monoxide_poisoning","Glaucoma","Intraocular_pressure","Human_brain","Pain","Nociceptor","Head","Neck","Meninges","Stress_(biology)","Blood_vessels","Endorphins","Aura_(symptom)","Human_cranium","Cerebral_cortex","Occipital_cortex","Birth_control_pills","Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)","American_College_of_Emergency_Physicians","Electroencephalogram","Diary","Medication","Menstruation","Absenteeism","Cluster_headache","Reuters","Acupuncture","Placebo_effect","Amitriptyline","Fluoxetine","Gabapentin","Tizanidine","Topiramate","Botulinum_toxin_type_a","Antiepileptics","Valproate","Emergency_department","Men","Women","Thomas_Willis","Christian_Baur","Idiopathic","Symptomatic","Child","Dental_braces","Orthodontic_headgear","Adolescence","Boy","Girls","Genetic_predisposition","Head_trauma","Infection","Ear_infection","Sinus_infection","Common_cold","Flu","Environmental_factors","Weather","Stress_(biology)","Anxiety","Depression_(mood)","Food","Beverages","Caffeine","Food_additives","Sleep","Physical_activity","Sun","Benign","Speech_problems","Muscle_weakness","Loss_of_vision","Hydrocephalus","Meningitis","Encephalitis","Abscess","Hemorrhage","Tumor","Blood_clot","Head_trauma","Central_nervous_system","Water","Caffeine","Meals"]}
