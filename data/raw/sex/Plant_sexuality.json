{"cursor":"25107","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'' flower, showing part of the gynoecium (the stigma and part of the style is\nvisible) and the stamens that surround it]]\n\n'Plant reproductive morphology' is concerned with the physical form and\nstructure (the morphology) of those parts of plants directly or indirectly\nconcerned with sexual reproduction.\n\nAmong all living organisms, flowers, which are the reproductive structures of\nangiosperms, are the most varied physically and show a correspondingly great\ndiversity in methods of reproduction. Plants that are not\nflowering plants (green alga, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, ferns and\ngymnosperms such as conifers) also have complex interplays between morphological\nadaptation and environmental factors in their sexual reproduction. The breeding\nsystem, or how the sperm from one plant fertilizes the ovum of another, depends\non the reproductive morphology, and is the single most important determinant of\nthe genetic structure of nonclonal plant populations. Christian Konrad Sprengel\n(1793) studied the reproduction of flowering plants and for the first time it\nwas understood that the pollination process involved both biotic and abiotic\ninteractions. Charles Darwin's theories of natural selection utilized this work\nto build his theory of evolution, which includes analysis of the coevolution of\nflowers and their insect pollinators.\n","linknr":467,"url":"Plant_sexuality","recorded":1362372937,"links":28,"instances":["botany","flower","biology"],"pdf":["http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/pdf/schb_189.pdf","http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/pdf/schb_189.pdf"],"categories":["Plant sexuality","Plant morphology"],"headings":["Use of sexual terminology","Flowering plants","See also","Notes","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Schlumbergera_04_ies.jpg/250px-Schlumbergera_04_ies.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Marchantia.jpg/220px-Marchantia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Ranunculus_glaberrimus_labelled.jpg/450px-Ranunculus_glaberrimus_labelled.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Tagalder8139.jpg/170px-Tagalder8139.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Hollyflowers.jpg/300px-Hollyflowers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Office-book.svg/30px-Office-book.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg/32px-Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/1859-Martinique.web.jpg/100px-1859-Martinique.web.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["corolla","flower"],["ovary","botany"],["homogamy","biology"]],"members":["ovary","corolla","homogamy"],"related":["Gynoecium","Stamen","Plant_morphology","Sexual_reproduction","Flower","Flowering_plants","Green_alga","Moss","Marchantiophyta","Hornworts","Fern","Gymnosperm","Conifer","Christian_Konrad_Sprengel","Pollination","Biotic_component","Abiotic","Charles_Darwin","Selection","Coevolution","Insect","Pollinator","Antheridium","Archegonium","Monoicous","Alternation_of_generations","Sporophyte","Spore","Gametophyte","Egg_cell","Sperm","Monoicous","Liverwort","Moss","Hornwort","Fern","Spermatophyte","Cycad","Conifer","Flowering_plant","Flower","Calyx","Sepal","Corolla_(flower)","Petal","Stamen","Pollen","Gametophyte","Gynoecium","Ovule","Ovary_(botany)","Stamen","Pollen","Carpel","Staminode","Vestigiality","Betulaceae","Homogamy_(biology)","Cannabis","Stamen","Carpel","Gamete","Apomixis","Self-incompatibility_in_plants","Sequential_hermaphroditism","Plant_growth_regulator","Ethephon","Gibberellin","Cytokinin","Botany","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Meiosis","Apomixis"]}
