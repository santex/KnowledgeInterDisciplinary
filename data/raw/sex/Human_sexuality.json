Human sexuality can also refer to the way someone is\nsexually attracted to another person â which is determined by their sexual\norientation â whether it is to the opposite sex (heterosexuality), to the same\nsex (homosexuality), having both these tendencies (bisexuality), University\nof California, Santa Barbara's SexInfo to all gender identities\n(pansexuality or bisexuality), or not being\nattracted to anyone in a sexual manner (asexuality). Human sexuality impacts\ncultural, political, legal, and philosophical aspects of life. It can refer to\nissues of morality, ethics, theology, spirituality, or religion. Some cultures\nhave been described as sexually repressive.\n\nInterest in sexual activity typically increases when an individual reaches\npuberty. Carlson, Neil R. and C.
