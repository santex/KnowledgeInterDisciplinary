{"cursor":"13574","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'', Fagin (the bearded old man) is a fence who recruits homeless boys and trains\nthem as pickpockets.]] A 'fence' is an individual who knowingly buys stolen\nproperty for later resale, sometimes in a legitimate market. The fence thus acts\nas a middleman between thieves and the eventual buyers of stolen goods who may\nnot be aware that the goods are stolen. As a verb, the word describes the\nbehavior of the thief in the transaction: The burglar fenced the stolen radio.\nThis sense of the term came from thieves' slang, first attested c. 1700, from\nthe notion of such transactions taking place under defence of\nsecrecy.\n\nThe fence is able to make a profit with stolen merchandise because he is able to\npay thieves a very low price for stolen goods. The fence then disguises the\nstolen nature of the goods, if possible, so that he or she can sell them closer\nto the usual wholesale price. In the 2000s, newer \"fencing operations hide from\nsight in legitimate businesses and show discipline and precision in their\ndealings\". Fencing is illegal in the United\nStates and in the United Kingdom, but the \"legal requirements for demonstrating\nthat fencing has occurred are complex\". what-when-how\nIn Depth Information: FENCING STOLEN PROPERTY (police) http://what-when-how.com/police-science/fencing-stolen-property-\npolice/ Accessed June 24, 2011.\n","linknr":179,"url":"Fence_(criminal)","recorded":1362570591,"links":17,"instances":["united_states"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Crimes","Theft","Commercial crimes","Organized crime activity"],"headings":["Approach","Legal aspects","E-fencing","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Dodger_introduces_Oliver_to_Fagin_by_Cruikshank_%28detail%29.jpg/250px-Dodger_introduces_Oliver_to_Fagin_by_Cruikshank_%28detail%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Car_window_burglary.jpg/200px-Car_window_burglary.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg/200px-US_Army_51805_Post%2C_AAFES_combat_increases_in_juvenile_shoplifting.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["supervalu","united_states"]],"members":["supervalu"],"related":["Thieves'_cant","United_States","United_Kingdom","Transaction_costs","Used_good","Serial_number","Wrecking_yard","Receipt_of_stolen_property","Federal_crime","Sting_operation","Pennsylvania","Pawnbroker","Sarasota,_Florida","Black_market","Money_laundering","EBay","Target_Corporation","SuperValu_(United_States)","Walmart","Minneapolis","Amazon.com","EBay","Online_auction","CNBC","Online_auction","Handling_stolen_goods","Sting_operation"]}
