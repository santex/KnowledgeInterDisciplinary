It was shot on high-\ndefinition video.\n\nIt featured some unusual production aspects. In traditional terms, the movie has\nno script. All lines were improvised according to an outline written by\nscreenwriter Coleman Hough, who previously teamed with Soderbergh on [[Full\nFrontal (film)|Full Frontal]]. Bubble was shot and edited by Soderbergh under\nthe pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard (taken from his father's given\nnames and his mother's maiden name, respectively).\n\nThe film uses non-professional actors recruited from the Parkersburg, West\nVirginia / Belpre, Ohio area, where the film was shot. For example, the lead,\nDebbie Doebereiner, was found working the drive-through window in a\nParkersburg KFC.\n\nBubble was released simultaneously in movie theaters and on the cable/satellite\nTV network HDNet Movies on January 27, 2006. The DVD was released a few days\nlater on January 31.\n\nIt was nominated for Best Director for Steven Soderbergh at the 2007 Independent\nSpirit Awards.\n\nBubble is the first of six films Soderbergh plans to shoot and release in the\nsame manner.\n\nThe score for the movie was composed by Robert Pollard, who lives in Ohio. {{Citation\n  | last = Olsen first = Mark title = The Indie Boy in the Soundtrack Bubble\n  | newspaper = New York Times date = 2006-01-29 url =\n  | http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/movies/29olse.html}}\n\n","linknr":162,"url":"Bubble_(film)","recorded":1362480504,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["2005 films","American films","American mystery films","2000s drama films","Films directed by Steven Soderbergh","English-language films","Films shot in West Virginia","Films shot in Ohio"],"headings":["Plot","Reception","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Bubble_poster.jpg/220px-Bubble_poster.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Steven_Soderbergh","Robert_Pollard","Magnolia_Pictures","Steven_Soderbergh","High-definition_video","Screenplay","Screenwriter","Coleman_Hough","Pseudonym","Given_name","Married_and_maiden_names","Parkersburg,_West_Virginia","Belpre,_Ohio","Drive-through","KFC","HDNet_Movies","DVD","Independent_Spirit_Awards","Robert_Pollard","Ohio_River","Nursing_home","Babysitting","Social_anxiety_disorder","Detective","Pawnbroker","Computed_tomography","Malignant","Tumor","Fainting","Independent_Spirit_Awards","Boing_Boing"]}
