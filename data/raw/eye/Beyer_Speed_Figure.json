{"cursor":"3025","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"The 'Beyer Speed Figure' is a system for rating the performance of Thoroughbred\nracehorses in North America designed in the early 1970s by Andrew Beyer, the\nsyndicated horse racing columnist for The Washington Post. First published in\nbook form in 1975, by 1992 the Daily Racing Form began incorporating Beyer Speed\nFigures in a horse's past performances and the system has evolved to where today\neach performance by every horse is given a Beyer number which reflects the time\nof the race and the inherent speed of the track over which it was run. On the\nBeyer scale, the top stakes horses in the United States and Canada earn numbers\nin the 100's, while extremely strong performances may rate as high as the 120's.\nIn Europe, Timeform has a different set up that yields a different rating\nnumber. The popular rule of thumb for a rough equivalent of the Timeform score\nis to deduct 12-14 points to achieve the Beyer figure.\n\nIn 2004, Ghostzapper earned the high Beyer Speed Figure at 128. In the July 5,\n2005 Hollywood Gold Cup, Lava Man turned in a speed figure of 120. Bordonaro\nearned a Beyer Speed Figure of 119 in winning the 2006 Ancient Title Handicap\nwhich was the highest number assigned to any North American horse in 2006. But\nit was Groovy, the 1987 American Champion Sprint Horse who won the highest\nfigure of all, earning 131 & 134 back-to-back in the Roseben and True North\nHandicaps at six furlongs in 1987, a record that is still unbeaten.

Over his career he\nhas earned Beyers of 119, 121, and 123. Andy Beyer said he canât recall a 7-year-\nold getting that high a number.\n\nBeyer calculated that had the Beyer Speed Figure calculation existed during\nthe proper time frame, Secretariat would have earned a figure of 139 for his\n1973 win at the Belmont Stakes. If that was true then Secretariat would have\nhad the highest Beyer speed\nfigure.
