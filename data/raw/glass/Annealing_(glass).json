{"cursor":"2790","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Annealing' is a process of slowly cooling glass to relieve internal stresses\nafter it was formed. The process may be carried out in a temperature-controlled\nkiln known as a lehr. E. F. Collins (1921) Electrically heated glass\nannealing lehr. Journal of the American Ceramic Society 4 (5), 335â349.\nGlass which has not been annealed is liable to crack or shatter when subjected\nto a relatively small temperature change or mechanical shock. Annealing glass is\ncritical to its durability. If glass is not annealed, it will retain many of the\nthermal stresses caused by quenching and significantly decrease the overall\nstrength of the glass.\n\nThe glass is heated until the temperature reaches a stress-relief point, that\nis, the 'annealing temperature' (also called 'annealing point') at a viscosity,\nÎ·, of 10 13 Poise = 10 12 PaÂ·s, at which the glass is still\ntoo hard to deform, but is soft enough for the stresses to relax. The piece is\nthen allowed to heat-soak until its temperature is even throughout. The time\nnecessary for this step varies depending on the type of glass and its maximum\nthickness. The glass is then slowly cooled at a predetermined rate until its\ntemperature is below the 'strain point' (Î· = 10 14.5 Poise). Following\nthis, the temperature can safely be dropped to room temperature at a rate\nlimited by the heat capacity, thickness, thermal conductivity, and thermal\nexpansion coefficient of the glass. After the annealing process the material can\nbe cut to size, drilled or polished.\n\nAt the annealing point (Î· = 10 13 Poise) stresses relax within\nseveral minutes, while at the strain point (Î· = 10 14.5 Poise)\nstresses relax within several hours.

K; 2nd revised edition (November 1994),\nISBN 3-540-57572-3 Stresses acquired during and remaining from\ntemperatures above the strain point are permanent unless annealed and may lead\nto short-term or much delayed failures. Stresses acquired during cooling below\nthe strain point are considered temporary though may be adequate to cause short-\nterm failure.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Annealing_(glass)","recorded":1362481727,"links":15,"instances":["physics","metallurgy","optical_components","glassmaking","engineering"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Glass engineering and science","Industrial processes","Warm glass"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Gluehlampe_01_KMJ.jpg/25px-Gluehlampe_01_KMJ.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lehr","glassmaking"],["stress","physics"],["deformation","engineering"],["annealing","metallurgy"],["fabrication_and_testing","optical_components"]],"members":["stress","annealing","fabrication_and_testing","lehr","deformation"],"related":["Glass","Kiln","Lehr_(glassmaking)","Quenching","Temperature","Stress_(physics)","Viscosity","Poise","Deformation_(engineering)","Room_temperature","Heat_capacity","Thermal_conductivity","Thermal_expansion_coefficient","Viscous_liquid","Annealing_(metallurgy)","Fabrication_and_testing_(optical_components)","Float_glass","Tempered_glass"]}
