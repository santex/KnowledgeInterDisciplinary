{"cursor":"15582","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe 'mercury-in-glass' or 'mercury thermometer' was invented by German physicist\nDaniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1714. It consists of a bulb containing mercury\nattached to a glass tube of narrow diameter; the volume of mercury in the tube\nis much less than the volume in the bulb. The volume of mercury changes slightly\nwith temperature; the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column a\nrelatively long way up the tube. The space above the mercury may be filled with\nnitrogen or it may be at less than atmospheric pressure, a partial vacuum.\n\nIn order to calibrate the thermometer, the bulb is made to reach thermal\nequilibrium with a temperature standard such as an ice/water mixture, and then\nwith another standard such as water/vapour, and the tube is divided into regular\nintervals between the fixed points. In principle thermometers made of different\nmaterial (e.g., coloured alcohol) might be expected to give different\nintermediate readings due to different expansion properties; in practice the\nsubstances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics\nas a function of true thermodynamic temperature and so give similar results.\n","linknr":246,"url":"Mercury-in-glass_thermometer","recorded":1362540235,"links":31,"instances":["philippines","element"],"pdf":["http://zerowastepilipinas.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/01_faye-ferrer.pdf"],"categories":["Thermometers","Meteorological instrumentation and equipment"],"headings":["History","Maximum thermometer","Maximum minimum thermometer","Physical properties","Phase-out","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Maximum_thermometer_close_up_2.JPG/220px-Maximum_thermometer_close_up_2.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Term%C3%B3metro_de_Lyon.jpg/170px-Term%C3%B3metro_de_Lyon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Quicksilvertermometer_Osaby.JPG/170px-Quicksilvertermometer_Osaby.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Clinical_thermometer_38.7.JPG/200px-Clinical_thermometer_38.7.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/EU_mercury_thermometer_ban_-_22_January_2013.svg/350px-EU_mercury_thermometer_ban_-_22_January_2013.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["department_of_health","philippines"]],"members":["department_of_health","mercury"],"related":["Daniel_Gabriel_Fahrenheit","Mercury_(element)","Glass","Nitrogen","Atmospheric_pressure","Vacuum","Thermal_equilibrium","Thermodynamic_temperature","Fahrenheit","Celsius","Anders_Celsius","Isaac_Newton","Water_vapor","Jean-Pierre_Christin","Centigrade","Triple_point","Medical_thermometer","Maximum_minimum_thermometer","Melting_point","Degree_Celsius","Degree_Fahrenheit","Thallium","Alloy","Meteorology","Medical","Galinstan","Gallium","Indium","Tin","Gram","Avoirdupois","Argentine_Health_Ministry","Blood_pressure_meter","Dentist","Medical_technician","Environmental_health","Pharmacy","Federal_Ministry_of_Environment","Department_of_Health_(Philippines)","Philippines","Philippine_Heart_Center","San_Juan_De_Dios_Educational_Foundation","List_of_hospitals_in_the_Philippines","List_of_hospitals_in_the_Philippines","List_of_hospitals_in_the_Philippines","Lung_Center_of_the_Philippines","List_of_hospitals_in_the_Philippines","Manila_Adventist_Medical_Center","List_of_hospitals_in_the_Philippines","Southeast_Asia","European_Union","Health_Protection_Agency","American_Academy_of_Pediatrics","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Mercury_probe","Mercury_switch","Mercury_swivel_commutator","Mercury_vapour_turbine"]}
