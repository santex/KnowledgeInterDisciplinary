It is also sometimes abbreviated as the 'ED 50 ',\nmeaning \"effective dose, for 50% of people given it\". The ED50 is commonly used\nas a measure of reasonable expectance of a drug effect, but not necessarily the\ndose that a clinician might use. This depends on the need for the effect, and\nalso the toxicity.\n\nThe ED95 is the dose required for desired effect in 95% of the population\nexposed to it. ED95 is more important in (for example) general anesthesia.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Effective_dose_(pharmacology)","recorded":1362510355,"links":24,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Pharmacology"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/FlattenedRoundPills.jpg/40px-FlattenedRoundPills.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Pharmacology","Medication","List_of_abbreviations_used_in_medical_prescriptions","Certain_safety_factor"]}
