{"cursor":"78217","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Genesis creation narrative' is the creation myth of both Judaism and\nChristianity. It is made up of two parts, roughly equivalent to the first two\nchapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first part, through , Elohim, the\ngeneric Hebrew word for God, creates the world in six days, then rests on,\nblesses and sanctifies the seventh day. God creates by spoken command (\"Let\nthere be...\"), suggesting a comparison with a king, who has only to speak for\nthings to happen, and names the elements of the cosmos as he creates them, in\nkeeping with the common ancient concept that things did not really exist until\nthey had been named. In the second, , Yahweh, the personal name of God, shapes\nthe first man from dust, places him in the Garden of Eden, and breathes his own\nbreath into the man who thus becomes {{transl|he|nephesh}}, a living being; man\nshares [[nephesh]] with all creatures, but only of man is this life-giving act\nof God described. The man names the animals, signifying his authority within\nGod's creation, and God creates the first woman, Eve, from the man's body.\n\nA common hypothesis among biblical scholars is that the first major\ncomprehensive draft of the Pentateuch (the series of five books which begins\nwith Genesis and ends with Deuteronomy) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th\ncentury BC (the Yahwist source) and that this was later expanded by other\nauthors or redactors of the (Priestly source) into a work very like the one we\nhave today. (In the creation narrative the two sources appear in reverse order:\nis Priestly and is Yahwistic.) Running through the combined narrative is a\ncritique of the Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism\nand denies polytheism, borrowing themes from Mesopotamian mythology, but\nadapting them to Israel's belief in one God. Robert Alter described the combined\nnarrative as \"compelling in its archetypal character, its adaptation of myth to\nmonotheistic ends\".\n","linknr":910,"url":"Genesis_creation_narrative","recorded":1362668272,"links":44,"instances":["egypt","christianity","bible","parsha","judaism","disambiguation"],"pdf":["http://home.comcast.net/~oregonstate-fscf/fscf_apr_19_2006_acro5.pdf","http://home.comcast.net/~oregonstate-fscf/fscf_apr_19_2006_acro5.pdf"],"categories":["Abrahamic
