The boundary (in Latin: limes) may appear as a\n discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar,\n but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a social construct,\n adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of property rights.\n\nA cadastral map displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of ownership.\nHowever, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or\njurisdiction is conceived of in terms more complex than a tessellation.\nTherefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the\nboundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.

Pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, et\nal, 2007.\n\nA 'Western' version of the operationalization might be a legally specified\nprocedure, performed by a chartered surveyor, supported by statements from\nneighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the\ncadastre as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous\npeople represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as song and\ndance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic\nor metaphorical manner.
