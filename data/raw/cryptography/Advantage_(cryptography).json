{"cursor":"5698","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn cryptography, an adversary's 'advantage' is a measure of how successfully it\ncan attack a cryptographic algorithm, by distinguishing it from an idealized\nversion of that type of algorithm. Note that in this context, the \"adversary\" is\nitself an algorithm and not a person. A cryptographic algorithm is considered\nsecure if no adversary has a non-negligible advantage, subject to specified\nbounds on the adversary's computational resources (see concrete security).\n\"Negligible\" usually means \"within O(2 -p )\" where p is a security\nparameter associated with the algorithm. For example, p might be the number of\nbits in a block cipher's key.\n","linknr":117,"url":"Advantage_(cryptography)","recorded":1362666575,"links":12,"instances":["cryptography","cryptography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Theory of cryptography"],"headings":["Description of concept","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/2/2327a640881019c9a5b701b3d8b6b0d0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/e/d7e84f89652a0117a919131d765f0d15.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adversary","cryptography"],["key","cryptography"]],"members":["adversary","key"],"related":["Cryptography","Algorithm","Adversary_(cryptography)","Person","Negligible","Concrete_security","Big_O_notation","Security_parameter","Key_(cryptography)","Oracle_machine","Data_Encryption_Standard","Block_cipher","Permutation","Platonic_ideal","Factorial","Stirling's_approximation","Random_oracle","Chosen-plaintext_attack","Chosen-ciphertext_attack","Brute_force_attack","Pseudorandom-function_advantage","Key-recovery_advantage","PR-CPA_advantage","Phillip_Rogaway","Mihir_Bellare"]}
