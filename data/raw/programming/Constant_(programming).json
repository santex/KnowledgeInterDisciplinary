{"cursor":"12131","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer programming, a 'constant' is an identifier whose associated value\ncannot typically be altered by the program during its execution (though in some\ncases this can be circumvented, e.g. using self-modifying code). Many\nprogramming languages make an explicit syntactic distinction between constant\nand variable symbols.\n\nAlthough a constant's value is specified only once, a constant may be referenced\nmany times in a program. Using a constant instead of specifying a value multiple\ntimes in the program can not only simplify code maintenance, but it can also\nsupply a meaningful name for it and consolidate such constant bindings to a\nstandard code location (for example, at the beginning).\n","linknr":143,"url":"Constant_(programming)","recorded":1362667273,"links":21,"instances":["computer_science","programming","computer_science","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Programming constructs"],"headings":["Comparison with literals and macros","Dynamically-valued constants","Constant function parameters","Object-oriented constants","Naming conventions","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["literal","computer_science"],["instruction","computer_science"],["macro","computer_science"],["naming_conventions","programming"],["macro","computer_science"]],"members":["literal","naming_conventions","instruction","macro"],"related":["Computer_programming","Self-modifying_code","Literal_(computer_science)","Instruction_(computer_science)","Macro_(computer_science)","ALGOL_68","Functional_programming","ML_programming_language","Purely_functional","Const-correctness","Called_by_value","Immutable_object","Naming_conventions_(programming)","Hungarian_notation","Prefix","Macro_(computer_science)","Enumerated_type","Address_constant","IBM/360","Z/Architecture"]}
