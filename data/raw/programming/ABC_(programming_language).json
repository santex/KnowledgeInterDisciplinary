It is interactive, structured, high-level, and intended to be\nused instead of BASIC, Pascal, or AWK. It is not meant to be a systems-\nprogramming language but is intended for teaching or prototyping.\n\nABC has only five basic datatypes. It does not require variable declarations. It\nhas explicit support for top-down programming. Statement nesting is indicated by\nindentation. It provides infinite precision arithmetic, unlimited sized lists\nand strings, and other features supporting orthogonality and ease of use by\nnovices. Its designers claim that ABC programs are typically around a quarter\nthe size of the equivalent Pascal or C programs, and more readable.\n\nABC was originally a monolithic implementation, leading to an inability to adapt\nto new requirements, such as creating a Graphical User Interface. ABC could not\ndirectly access the underlying file system and operating system.\n\nABC includes a programming environment with syntax-directed editing,\nsuggestions, persistent variables, and multiple workspaces.\n\nABC is available as an interpreter/compiler, currently at version 1.05.02. ABC\nhas been ported to Unix, DOS, Atari, and Apple Macintosh.\n\nABC also had a major influence on the design of the Python programming language;\nGuido van Rossum, who developed Python, previously worked for several years on\nthe ABC system in the early 1980s. http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.ph-\np/id;66665771 http://www.onlamp.com/lpt/a/2431\n","linknr":170,"url":"ABC_(programming_language)","recorded":1362581105,"links":29,"instances":["programming_language","programming_language","computer_software"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Educational programming languages","Persistent programming languages","Procedural programming languages","Programming languages created in the 1980s"],"headings":["Example","Notes","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/HelloWorld.svg/50px-HelloWorld.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["python","programming_language"],["c","programming_language"],["interpreter","computer_software"],["python","programming_language"]],"members":["c","python","interpreter"],"related":["Multi-paradigm_programming_language","Imperative_programming","Procedural_programming","Structured_programming","Leo_Geurts","Lambert_Meertens","Steven_Pemberton","Centrum_Wiskunde_&_Informatica","Strongly-typed_programming_language","Type_polymorphism","SETL","ALGOL_68","ALGOL_68","Guido_van_Rossum","O'Reilly_Media","Python_(programming_language)","Programming_language","Integrated_development_environment","Centrum_Wiskunde_&_Informatica","Netherlands","Leo_Geurts","Lambert_Meertens","Steven_Pemberton","BASIC_programming_language","Pascal_programming_language","AWK_programming_language","Datatype","Top-down_programming","Indentation","Infinite_precision_arithmetic","C_(programming_language)","Graphical_User_Interface","Syntax-directed_editor","Static_variable","Interpreter_(computer_software)","Compiler","Unix","DOS","Atari","Apple_Macintosh","Python_(programming_language)","Guido_van_Rossum","Off-side_rule"]}
