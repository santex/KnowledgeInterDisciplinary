{"cursor":"28126","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Computer programming' (often shortened to 'programming', 'scripting', or\n'coding') is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and\nmaintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in\none or more programming languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, Smalltalk,\netc.). The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that\ncomputers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors.\nThe process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different\nsubjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms\nand formal logic.\n\nWithin software engineering, programming (the implementation) is regarded as one\nphase in a software development process.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an\nart form, a craft, or an engineering discipline. In general, good\nprogramming is considered to be the measured application of all three, with the\ngoal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution (the criteria for\n\"efficient\" and \"evolvable\" vary considerably). The discipline differs from many\nother technical professions in that programmers, in general, do not need to be\nlicensed or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification\ntests in order to call themselves \"programmers\" or even \"software engineers.\"\nBecause the discipline covers many areas, which may or may not include critical\napplications, it is debatable whether licensing is required for the profession\nas a whole. In most cases, the discipline is self-governed by the entities which\nrequire the programming, and sometimes very strict environments are defined\n(e.g. United States Air Force use of AdaCore and security clearance). However,\nrepresenting oneself as a \"Professional Software Engineer\" without a license\nfrom an accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world.\n\nAnother ongoing debate is the extent to which the programming language used in\nwriting computer programs affects the form that the final program takes. This\ndebate is analogous to that surrounding the SapirâWhorf hypothesis Kenneth\nE. Iverson, the originator of the APL programming language, believed that the\nSapirâWhorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually\nmentioning the hypothesis by name). His Turing award lecture, \"Notation as a\ntool of thought\", was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful\nnotations aided thinking about computer algorithms. Iverson\nK.E.,\"[http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf Notation as a tool of thought]\",\nCommunications of the ACM, 23: 444-465 (August 1980). in linguistics and\ncognitive science, which postulates that a particular spoken language's nature\ninfluences the habitual thought of its speakers. Different language patterns\nyield different patterns of thought. This idea challenges the possibility of\nrepresenting the world perfectly with language, because it acknowledges that the\nmechanisms of any language condition the thoughts of its speaker
