{"cursor":"14233","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn ice hockey, a 'goal' is scored when the puck completely crosses the goal line\nbetween the two goal posts and below the goal crossbar. A goal awards one point\nto the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team the player\nwho actually deflected the puck into the goal belongs to (see also own goal).\nTypically, a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with his/her\nstick towards the goal net opening, and a player on the opposing team called a\ngoaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against\nhis/her team.\n\nThe term goal may also refer to the structure in which goals are scored. The ice\nhockey goal is rectangular in shape; the front frame of the goal is made of\nsteel tube painted red and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal\ncrossbar. A net is attached to the back of the frame to catch pucks that enter\nthe goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind. The entire goal\nis considered an inbounds area of the playing surface, and it is legal to play\nthe puck behind the goal. Under NHL rules, the opening of the goal is wide by\ntall, and the footprint of the goal is deep.\n","linknr":206,"url":"Goal_(ice_hockey)","recorded":1362582493,"links":23,"instances":["green_day_song","hockey","u2_song","ice_hockey","soccer","hockey","ice_hockey","sport","hockey","ice_hockey","band","hockey","ice_hockey","ice_hockey","hockey"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ice hockey rules","Ice hockey statistics","Ice hockey terminology"],"headings":["Method of scoring","Credit for goals and assists","Scoring statistics","Types of goals","Related terms","Goal horn","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Hockey_goal_cmd_2004.jpg/300px-Hockey_goal_cmd_2004.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ice_Hockey_2-on-1_One-Timer.gif/349px-Ice_Hockey_2-on-1_One-Timer.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Goal.png/125px-Goal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/3/5c3b24d086d817a9427efe7e845c8cfe.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["defenceman","ice_hockey"],["forward","hockey"],["official","ice_hockey"],["crease","hockey"],["assist","ice_hockey"],["point","hockey"],["forward","ice_hockey"],["power_play","sport"],["penalty_shot","ice_hockey"],["overtime","hockey"],["save","ice_hockey"],["football","soccer"],["assist","hockey"],["shot","hockey"],["locksley","band"],["holiday","green_day_song"],["vertigo","u2_song"],["assist","hockey"],["point","hockey"]],"members":["holiday","assist","vertigo","forward","football","crease","save","power_play","point","penalty_shot","locksley","overtime","defenceman","official","shot"],"related":["Ice_hockey","Hockey_puck","Own_goal","Hockey_stick","Goaltender","National_Hockey_League","Goaltender","Defenceman_(ice_hockey)","Forward_(hockey)","Hockey_stick","Official_(ice_hockey)","Crease_(hockey)","National_Hockey_League","Stanley_Cup","Brett_Hull","Dallas_Stars","Buffalo_Sabres","Assist_(ice_hockey)","Point_(hockey)","Forward_(ice_hockey)","Defenceman","Goaltender","Rocket_Richard_Trophy","Maurice_Richard","Wayne_Gretzky","Edmonton_Oilers","Neutral_zone_trap","American_Hockey_League","Power_play_(sport)","Penalty_kill","Extra_attacker","Penalty_shot_(ice_hockey)","Overtime_(hockey)","Save_(ice_hockey)","Goal_judge","Football_(soccer)","Assist_(hockey)","Hat_trick","Natural_hat_trick","Shot_(hockey)","Shot_on_goal","NHL_All-Star_Game","Washington_Capitals","Anaheim_Ducks","Boston_Bruins","Hartford_Whalers","Brass_Bonanza","Bro_Hymn","Chelsea_Dagger","Locksley_(band)","Holiday_(Green_Day_song)","Vertigo_(U2_song)","Howling_for_You","I_Like_It,_I_Love_It","Assist_(hockey)","Point_(hockey)","List_of_NHL_statistical_leaders","List_of_goaltenders_who_have_scored_a_goal_in_an_NHL_game"]}
