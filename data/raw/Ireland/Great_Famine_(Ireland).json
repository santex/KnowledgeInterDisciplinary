It is also known, mostly outside Ireland, as\nthe 'Irish Potato Famine'. In the Irish language it is called an Gorta MÃ³r (,\nmeaning \"the Great Hunger\") or an Drochshaol (, meaning \"the bad life\").\n\nDuring the famine approximately 1 million people died and a million more\nemigrated from Ireland, causing the island's population to fall by between 20%\nand 25%. The proximate cause of famine was a potato disease commonly known as\npotato blight. Although blight ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the\n1840s, the impact and human cost in Irelandwhere one-third of the population was\nentirely dependent on the potato for foodwas exacerbated by a host of political,\nethnic, religious, social and economic factors which remain the subject of\nhistorical debate.\n\nThe famine was a watershed in the history of Ireland. Its effects permanently\nchanged the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape. For both\nthe native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk\nmemory|group=fn}} and became a rallying point for various nationalist\nmovements as the whole island was then part of the United Kingdom of Great\nBritain and Ireland.\n\nThe massive famine soured the relations between many of the Catholic Irish\npeople and the officially Protestant British Crown, heightening Irish\nnationalism that eventually led to Irish independence in the 20th century.\nModern historians regard it as a dividing line in the Irish historical\nnarrative, referring to the preceding period of Irish history as \"pre-Famine\".\n","linknr":1194,"url":"Great_Famine_(Ireland)","recorded":1362670108,"links":66,"instances":["author","historian","ireland","farmer","book","1879","irish_confederation","farmer","government","philanthropist"],"pdf":["http://www.tara.tcd.ie/jspui/bitstream/2262/4522/1/jssisiVolXXPart3_0135.pdf","http://www.tara.tcd.ie/jspui/bitstream/2262/4522/1/jssisiVolXXPart3_0135.pdf"],"categories":["Great
