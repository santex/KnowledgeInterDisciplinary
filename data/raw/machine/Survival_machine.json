Williams's first book\n[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]. Dawkins coined the term \"selfish gene\" as\na way of expressing the gene-centred view of evolution as opposed to the views\nfocused on the organism and the group, popularizing ideas developed during the\n1960s by W. D. Hamilton and others. From the gene-centred view follows that the\nmore two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of\nthe genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other. Therefore the\nconcept is especially good at explaining many forms of altruism, regardless of a\ncommon misuse of the term along the lines of a selfishness gene.\n\nAn organism is expected to evolve to maximize its inclusive fitnessâthe number\nof copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular\nindividual). As a result, populations will tend towards an evolutionarily stable\nstrategy. The book also coins the term [[meme]] for a unit of human cultural\nevolution analogous to the gene, suggesting that such \"selfish\" replication may\nalso model human culture, in a different sense. Memetics has become the subject\nof many studies since the publication of the book.\n\nIn the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he \"can\nreadily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its\ncontents\" and in retrospect thinks he should have taken Tom Maschler's advice\nand called the book The Immortal Gene.\n","linknr":352,"url":"Survival_machine","recorded":1362374151,"links":45,"instances":["guardian_journalist","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Books by Richard Dawkins","Books about evolution","Popular science books","1976 books","DNA replication","Memetics","Cognitive science literature","Science studies"],"headings":["\"Selfish\" genes","Genes and selection","Reception","Editions","References","Sources","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a2/The_Selfish_Gene3.jpg/200px-The_Selfish_Gene3.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["volition","psychology"],["andrew_brown","guardian_journalist"]],"members":["andrew_brown","volition"],"related":["Desmond_Morris","Richard_Dawkins","Evolutionary_biology","Oxford_University_Press","The_Extended_Phenotype","Evolution","Richard_Dawkins","1976_in_literature","George_C._Williams","Gene-centered_view_of_evolution","Group_selection","W._D._Hamilton","Altruism","Inclusive_fitness","Evolutionarily_stable_strategy","Cultural_evolution","Memetics","Tom_Maschler","Volition_(psychology)","Altruism","Kinship","Andrew_Brown_(Guardian_journalist)","Donald_Symons","Molecule","Intragenomic_conflict","Birth_control","Human_fertilization","Malthusian","Kin_selection","Eusociality","Altruism","Phenotype","Group_selection","Charles_Darwin","Mathematical_biology","Alan_Grafen","Mendelian_genetics","Arthur_Cain","Evolutionary_biology","Group_selectionism","Allele","Weidenfeld_&_Nicolson","Stephen_Jay_Gould","Phenotype","Genotype","Penguin_Books","Kim_Sterelny","Icon_Books","Niles_Eldredge","New_York_City","W._W._Norton","Philosophy","Mary_Midgley","Morality","Primatologist","Frans_de_Waal","Veneer_theory","Robert_Trivers","London_School_of_Economics","Helena_Cronin","Melvyn_Bragg","Lalla_Ward","Oxford_University_Press","New_York_City","Oxford_University_Press","New_York_City","Google_Videos","Edge_Foundation,_Inc."]}
