{"cursor":"6380","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'folding machine' is a machine used primarily for the folding of paper. Paper\ncan be folded with either a buckle or a knife; thus, there are generally three\ntypes of folding machines: buckle folders, knife folders or a combination of\nthese two types. Whilst buckle folding is the more popular of the two methods,\nknife folding is sometimes preferable. Folding machine models vary in\nsophistication, with machines capable of processing more complex folding jobs\nand unusual paper forms (in terms of density and size).\n\nOrganizations required to undertake mass mail-out campaigns often employ folding\nmachines to improve efficiency. Some of the most popular\nfolders used by printing companies and binders are: MBO (Maschinenbau Binder\nOppenweiler), Stahlfolder (now by Heidelberg), GUK, Horizon and Baumfolder.\n","linknr":184,"url":"Folding_machine","recorded":1362484296,"links":20,"instances":["device"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Print production"],"headings":["Buckle folders","Knife folders","Paper folders","Folder inserters","Folder sealers","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Folder.PNG/220px-Folder.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Falzmaschine_2009_01_%28RaBoe%29.jpg/220px-Falzmaschine_2009_01_%28RaBoe%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Buchdrucker-1568.png/120px-Buchdrucker-1568.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spring","device"]],"members":["spring"],"related":["Paper_folding","Buckle","Paper_density","Paper_size","Mailing_list","Friction","Pocket","Spring_(device)"]}
