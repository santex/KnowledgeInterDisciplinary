Computer\nsimulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural\nsystems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, chemistry and biology,\nhuman systems in economics, psychology, social science, and engineering.\nSimulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It\ncan be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology, and to\nestimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical\nsolutions. {{Cite book\n  | last =Strogatz first =Steven contribution =The End of Insight year =2007\n  | title =What is your dangerous idea? editor-last =Brockman editor-first =John\n  | publisher =HarperCollins issn =9780061214950 postscript = }}\n\nComputer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes, to network-\nbased groups of computers running for hours, to ongoing simulations that run for\ndays. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far\nexceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-\npencil mathematical modeling.
