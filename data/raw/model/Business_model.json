Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur, Alan Smith, and 470 practitioners\nfrom 45 countries, self published, 2010 (economic, social, cultural, or\nother forms of value). The process of business model construction is part of\nbusiness strategy.\n\nIn theory and practice the term business model is used for a broad range of\ninformal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business,\nincluding purpose, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational\nstructures, trading practices, and operational processes and policies. The\nliterature has provided very diverse interpretations and definitions of a\nbusiness model. A systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a\nsurvey defines business models as the design of organizational structures to\nenact a commercial opportunity.

Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 35(1): 83-111 Further\nextensions to this design logic emphasize the use of narrative or coherence in\nbusiness model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs create\nextraordinarily successful growth firms.

Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-17084-0\n\nWhenever a business is established, it either explicitly or implicitly employs a\nparticular business model that describes the architecture of the value creation,\ndelivery, and capture mechanisms employed by the business enterprise. The\nessence of a business model is that it defines the manner by which the business\nenterprise delivers value to customers, entices customers to pay for value, and\nconverts those payments to profit: it thus reflects managementâs hypothesis\nabout what customers want, how they want it, and how an enterprise can organize\nto best meet those needs, get paid for doing so, and make a profit. (David\nTeece 2010)\n\nBusiness models are used to describe and classify businesses (especially in an\nentrepreneurial setting), but they are also used by managers inside companies to\nexplore possibilities for future development. Also, well known business models\noperate as recipes for creative managers. (Charles Baden-Fuller and Mary\nMorgan, 2010) Business models are also referred to in some instances\nwithin the context of accounting for purposes of public reporting.\n","linknr":343,"url":"Business_model","recorded":1362374843,"links":51,"instances":["business","law","movie_rental_store","business"],"pdf":["http://www.iese.edu/research/pdfs/DI-0862-E.pdf","http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1175820761372&blobheader=application%2Fpdf","http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1175820761372&blobheader=application%2Fpdf","http://www.iasplus.com/iasplus/1101amendtoias12.pdf","http://www.iasplus.com/iasplus/1101amendtoias12.pdf","http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Supplement_93_GL_IFRS/$File/Supplement_93_GL_IFRS.pdf","http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Supplement_93_GL_IFRS/$File/Supplement_93_GL_IFRS.pdf","http://www.ifrs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C03C9E95-822E-4716-81ED-04B9CC4943BE/0/EDLeasesStandard0810.pdf","http://www.ifrs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C03C9E95-822E-4716-81ED-04B9CC4943BE/0/EDLeasesStandard0810.pdf","http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1175821125393&blobheader=application%2Fpdf","http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1175821125393&blobheader=application%2Fpdf","http://www.gnaie.net/sites/default/files/library/03%20Business%20model%20IWG%20final.pdf","http://www.gnaie.net/sites/default/files/library/03%20Business%20model%20IWG%20final.pdf","http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/insurance/IFRS/assets/FASB-meeting-notes-020910.pdf","http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/insurance/IFRS/assets/FASB-meeting-notes-020910.pdf","http://www.hec.unil.ch/aosterwa/PhD/Osterwalder_PhD_BM_Ontology.pdf"],"categories":["Business models|","Strategic management","Management","Types of marketing"],"headings":["History","Theoretical and empirical insights to business models","Applications","Examples of Business models","Business model frameworks","Related concepts","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Safewaydeliverytruck.jpg/240px-Safewaydeliverytruck.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["blockbuster","movie_rental_store"],["amortization","business"],["distribution","business"],["agency","law"],["distribution","business"]],"members":["amortization","agency","blockbuster","distribution"],"related":["Explanation","Organization","Business_strategy","Business","Razor_and_blades_business_model","Adobe_Systems","McDonald's","Toyota","Wal-Mart","Hypermarkets","FedEx","Toys_R_Us","Blockbuster_(movie_rental_store)","Home_Depot","Intel","Dell_Computer","Southwest_Airlines","Netflix","EBay","Amazon.com","Starbucks","Gerry_George","Web_2.0","Thomas_W._Malone","MIT","Accounting","International_Accounting_Standards_Board","Amortization_(business)","Fair_value","Financial_instrument","Financial_Accounting_Standards_Board","Deferred_taxes","International_Financial_Reporting_Standards","Lease","Insurance_contract","European_Financial_Reporting_Advisory_Group","European_Union","Bricks_and_clicks","On-line_and_off-line","Collective_business_system","Business","Professional","Disintermediation","Intermediary","Supply_chain","Distribution_(business)","Wholesaler","Agency_(law)","Direct_selling","Party_plan","Distribution_(business)","Fee_in,_free_out","Franchising","Freemium","Auction_business_model","All-in-one_business_model","Chemical_Leasing","Low-cost_carrier","Loyalty_business_model","Monopoly","Multi-level_marketing","Network_effect","Online_auction_business_model","Online_content_business_model","Premium_business_model","Professional_open-source","Pyramid_scheme","Freebie_marketing","Service_economy","Subscription_business_model","Business_reference_model","Business_architecture","Component_business_model","IBM","Investment","North_America","Supermarket","Safeway_Inc.","Industrialization_of_services_business_model","Business_Model_Canvas","Business_strategy","Workflows","Business_operations","Business_modeling","Business_process","Business_model_design","Brand","Integrated_marketing","Nonprofit_organization","Business_model_design","Business_plan","Business_process_modeling","Business_reference_model","Business_rule","Competitive_advantage","Core_competency","Growth_platforms","Market_forms","Marketing","Marketing_plan","Strategic_management","Strategic_planning","Strategy_dynamics","Value_migration","The_Design_of_Business","Electronic_Markets"]}
