{"cursor":"17242","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'macroeconomic model' is an analytical tool designed to describe the operation\nof the economy of a country or a region. These models are usually designed to\nexamine the dynamics of aggregate quantities such as the total amount of goods\nand services produced, total income earned, the level of employment of\nproductive resources, and the level of prices.\n\nMacroeconomic models may be logical, mathematical, and/or computational; the\ndifferent types of macroeconomic models serve different purposes and have\ndifferent advantages and disadvantages. Macroeconomics models may be used to\nclarify and illustrate basic theoretical principles; they may be used to test,\ncompare, and quantify different macroeconomic theories; they may be used to\nproduce \"what if\" scenarios (usually to predict the effects of changes in\nmonetary, fiscal, or other macroeconomic policies); and they may be used to\ngenerate economic forecasts. Thus, macroeconomic models are widely used in\nacademia, teaching and research, and are also widely used by international\norganizations, national governments and larger corporations, as well as by\neconomics consultants and think tanks.\n","linknr":263,"url":"Macroeconomic_model","recorded":1362374859,"links":19,"instances":["mathematics","economics","game_theory","economist","economics"],"pdf":["http://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/acewp1.pdf"],"categories":["Macroeconomics","Macroeconomic forecasting","Economics models"],"headings":["Types of macroeconomic models","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf/page1-350px-DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["good","economics"],["agent","economics"],["optimization","mathematics"],["michael_woodford","economist"],["agent","economics"],["strategy","game_theory"],["strategy","game_theory"]],"members":["optimization","good","strategy","michael_woodford","agent"],"related":["Economy","Good_(economics)","Price_level","Macroeconomic","Monetary_policy","Fiscal_policy","Forecasting","Think_tank","IS-LM_model","Mundellâ€“Fleming_model","Keynesian_economics","Neoclassical_growth_model","Neoclassical_economics","Economic_growth","Comparative_statics","Dynamical_system","GDP","Employment","National_income_and_product_accounts","Time_series_analysis","Computational_economics","Adaptive_expectations","Netherlands","Economist","Jan_Tinbergen","Netherlands","United_States","United_Kingdom","Wharton_Econometric_Forecasting_Associates","Project_LINK","Lawrence_Klein","Nobel_Prize_in_Economics","Phillips_curve","Milton_Friedman","Edmund_Phelps","Stagflation","Robert_Lucas,_Jr.","Microfoundations","Preferences","Production_function","Budget_constraint","Lucas_critique","Microfoundations","Agent_(economics)","Preferences","Production_function","Budget_constraint","Optimization_(mathematics)","Nash_equilibrium","Representative_agent","Representative_agent","Rational_expectations","Per_Krusell","Anthony_A._Smith,_Jr.","Adaptive_expectations","Computational_economics","Business_cycles","Real_business_cycles","Finn_E._Kydland","Edward_C._Prescott","Thomas_F._Cooley","New_Keynesian_economics","Julio_Rotemberg","Michael_Woodford_(economist)","Social_welfare_function","Consensus_forecast","Microfoundations","Agent_based_model","Agent_(economics)","Preferences","Strategy_(game_theory)","Rational_expectations","Representative_agent","Network_effect","Strategy_(game_theory)","Preferences","Lucas_critique","Economic_model","Mathematical_model","Macroeconomics","Economics","Econometrics","Computational_economics","Lucas_critique","Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium","Agent-Based_Computational_Economics","History_of_macroeconomic_thought","Time_series"]}
