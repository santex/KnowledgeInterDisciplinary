This still life painting depicts a variety of\nFrench Baroque musical instruments, such as a natural horn, transverse flute,\nmusette, violin, and lute.]] A 'musical instrument' is a device created or\nadapted to musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be a\nmusical instrumentâit is through purpose that the object becomes a musical\ninstrument. The history of musical instruments dates back to the beginnings of\nhuman culture. The purpose of early musical instruments was ritual: a hunter\nmight use a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a shaman might use a drum\nin a religious ceremony. Cultures later developed the processes of composing and\nperforming melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with\nchanging applications.\n\nThe date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is\ndisputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument,\na simple flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years. Consensus begins to form\nabout early flutes dating to about 37,000 years old. However, most historians\nbelieve that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is\nimpossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative\ninstability of materials that were used in their construction. Many early\nmusical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-\ndurable materials.\n\nMusical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the\nworld. However, contact among civilizations resulted in the rapid spread and\nadaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the Middle\nAges, instruments from Mesopotamia could be found in Maritime Southeast Asia and\nEuropeans were playing instruments from North Africa. Development in the\nAmericas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South\nAmerica shared musical instruments. By 1400, musical instrument development\nslowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident.\n\nThe classification of musical instruments is a discipline in its own right, and\nmany systems of classification have been used over the years. One may classify\nmusical instruments by their effective range or their material composition;\nhowever, the most common method, Hornbostel-Sachs, uses the means by which they\nproduce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.\n","linknr":1361,"url":"Musical_instruments","recorded":1362485939,"links":121,"instances":["music","music","music","music","mythology","bible","flute","country","percussion_instrument","music","plant","percussion_instrument","sound","music","music","music","mythology","music","instrument"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical
