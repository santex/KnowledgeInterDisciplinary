Buying the\nzero-coupon bond ensures the guarantee of the capital, and the remaining\nproceeds are used to buy an option.\n\n----\n\nAs an example, we can consider a bond+call on 5 years, with Nokia as an\nunderlying. Say it is a USD currency option, and that 5 year rates are 4.7%.\nThat gives you a zero-coupon bond price of ZCB(USD,5y,4.7\\%)=e^{-\n5*0.047}\\approx0.7906 .\n\nSay we are counting in units of $100. We then have to buy $79.06 worth of bond\nto guarantee the 100 to be repaid at maturity, and we have $20.94 to spend on an\noption. Now the option price is unlikely to be exactly equal to 20.94 in this\ncase, and it really depends on the underlying. Say we are using the\nBlackâScholes price for the call, and that we strike the option at the money,\nthe volatility is the defining part here. A call on an underlying with implied\nvolatility of 25% will give you a BlackâScholes price of $15.7 while with a\nvolatility of 45%, you'd have to pay $21.76.\n\nHence the 'participation' would be the proportion you can get with the\nmoney you have.\n* In the 25% vol case you get a 133% participation\n* In the 45% vol case, 96%.\n","linknr":95,"url":"Participation_(Finance)","recorded":1362688483,"links":15,"instances":["finance","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Bonds","Derivatives (finance)"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/2/b/82bcfd80f3a6576a4a995fed52502254.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["option","finance"],["volatility","finance"]],"members":["volatility","option"],"related":["Capital_guarantee","Option_(finance)","Zero-coupon_bond","Nokia","Underlying","Currency","Zero-coupon_bond","Black–Scholes","At_the_money","Volatility_(finance)","Implied_volatility","Black–Scholes"]}
