{"cursor":"15383","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Petrochemicals' are chemical products derived from petroleum. Some chemical\ncompounds made from petroleum are also obtained from other fossil fuels, such as\ncoal or natural gas, or renewable sources such as corn or sugar cane.\n\nThis article focuses on organic compounds that are not burned as fuel (see also\nPetroleum product).\n\nTwo petrochemical classes are olefins including ethylene and propylene, and\naromatics including benzene, toluene, and xylene isomers. Oil refineries produce\nolefins and aromatics by fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum fractions.\nChemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like\nethane and propane. Aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha.\nOlefins and aromatics are the building-blocks for a wide range of materials such\nas solvents, detergents, and adhesives. Olefins are the basis for polymers and\noligomers used in plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers, lubricants, and\ngels.\n\nGlobal ethylene and propylene production are ~115 million tonnes and ~70 million\ntonnes per annum, respectively. Aromatics production is ~70 million tonnes. The\nlargest petrochemical industries are located in the USA and Western Europe;\nhowever, major growth in new production capacity is in the Middle East and Asia.\nThere is substantial inter-regional petrochemical trade.\n\nPrimary petrochemicals are divided into three groups depending on their chemical\nstructure:\n* Olefins includes ethylene, propylene, and butadiene. Ethylene and propylene\n  are important sources of industrial chemicals and plastics products. Butadiene\n  is used in making synthetic rubber.\n* Aromatics includes benzene, toluene, and xylenes. Benzene is a raw material\n  for dyes and synthetic detergents, and benzene and toluene for isocyanates MDI\n  and TDI used in making polyurethanes. Manufacturers use xylenes to produce\n  plastics and synthetic fibers.\n* Synthesis gas is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen used to make\n  ammonia and methanol. Ammonia is used to make the fertilizer urea and methanol\n  is used as a solvent and chemical intermediate.\n\nThe prefix \"petro-\" is an arbitrary abbreviation of the word \"petroleum\"; since\n\"petro-\" is Ancient Greek for \"rock\" and \"oleum\" means \"oil\". Therefore, the\netymologically correct term would be \"oleochemicals\". However, the term\noleochemical is used to describe chemicals derived from plant and animal fats.\n","linknr":449,"url":"Petrochemicals","recorded":1362375565,"links":34,"instances":["chemistry","coolant","business"],"pdf":["http://www.tsp2.org/news/Butadiene%20Supply%20AMAP%20Update.pdf","http://www.technip.com/pdf/brochures/Ethylene.pdf"],"categories":["Petroleum
