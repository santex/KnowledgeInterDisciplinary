ACC is a multi-\nsubunit enzyme in most prokaryotes and in the chloroplasts of most plants and\nalgae, whereas it is a large, multi-domain enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum\nof most eukaryotes. The most important function of ACC is to provide the malonyl-\nCoA substrate for the biosynthesis of fatty acids. The activity of ACC can be controlled at the\ntranscriptional level as well as by small molecule modulators and covalent\nmodification. The human genome contains the genes for two different ACCs â ACACA and ACACB.\n","linknr":558,"url":"Acetyl-CoA_carboxylase","recorded":1362502973,"links":22,"instances":["biochemistry","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["EC 6.4.1"],"headings":["Structure","Mechanism","Function","Regulation","Clinical implications","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Biotin_carboxylase_rainbow.png/240px-Biotin_carboxylase_rainbow.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/BCCP.png/240px-BCCP.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Carboxytransferase_2F9Y_E-Coli.png/240px-Carboxytransferase_2F9Y_E-Coli.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/ACAC_mechanism.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bb/Control_of_Acetyl_CoA_Carboxylase_corrected.png/500px-Control_of_Acetyl_CoA_Carboxylase_corrected.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["promoter","biology"],["receptor","biochemistry"]],"members":["receptor","promoter"],"related":["ACACA","ACACA","ACACB","ACACB","Biotin","Enzyme","Acetyl-CoA","Malonyl-CoA","Prokaryotes","Chloroplast","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Eukaryotes","Fatty_acid_biosynthesis","Covalent_modification","ACACA","ACACB","Prokaryotes","Plants","Holoenzyme","Humans","Eukaryotes","N-terminus","C-terminus","Biotin","Side_chain","Biotin","Bicarbonate","Biotin","Acetyl_CoA","Malonyl_CoA","Active_site","Adenosine_triphosphate","PKa","Bicarbonate","Enzyme","Acid_dissociation_constant","Bicarbonate","Nucleophile","CO<sub>2</sub>","Carbon_dioxide","Enolate","Proton","Carnitine","Carnitine_acyltransferase","Beta-oxidation","Mitochondria","Mammals","Isoforms","Cytoplasm","Adipose","Mammary_glands","Skeletal_muscle","Heart","Liver","Malonyl_CoA","Promoter_(biology)","Isozymes","Transcription_factors","SREBP1c","ChREBP","Carbohydrates","Citrate","Polymerization","Glutamate","Dicarboxylic_acids","Glucagon","Epinephrine","Receptor_(biochemistry)","Kinase","Protein_kinase_A","Insulin","Cell_membrane","Morpheein","Allosteric_regulation","Antibiotics","Diabetes","Obesity","Metabolic_syndrome","Antibiotics","Malonyl-CoA_decarboxylase"]}
