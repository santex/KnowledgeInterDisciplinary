Low was a self-taught cartoonist. Born in New Zealand,\nhe worked in his native country before migrating to Sydney, Australia in 1911,\nand ultimately to London (1919), where he made his career and earned fame for\nhis Colonel Blimp depictions and his merciless satirising the personalities and\npolicies of German dictator Adolf Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini,\nSoviet dictator Joseph Stalin, and other leaders of his times.\n\nLow was born in and educated in New Zealand. His first work was published when\nhe was only 11 years old. His professional career began at [[The Canterbury\nTimes]] in 1910. The following year he moved to Australia and worked for the\n''Bulletin''. His work attracted the attention of Henry Cadbury the part owner\nof [[The Star (London)|The London Star]] and he moved to London in 1919 and\nworked for them until 1927 before moving to The Evening Standard. Here he\nproduced his most famous work, chronicling the rise of fascism in the 1930s\nand the conflict of World War II. His stinging depictions of Hitler and\nMussolini led to his work being banned in Italy and Germany and being named in\nThe Black Book.\n","linknr":225,"url":"David_Low_(cartoonist)","recorded":1362477725,"links":43,"instances":["government","1939"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1891 births","1963 deaths","New Zealand cartoonists","Australian cartoonists","British cartoonists","Knights Bachelor","People from Dunedin","People educated at Christchurch Boys' High School","New Zealand emigrants to the United Kingdom"],"headings":["Biography","Collections","Selected bibliography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/Davidlowrendezvous.png/150px-Davidlowrendezvous.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["kingdom_of_italy","1861-1946"],["minister","government"],["invasion_of_poland","1939"],["kingdom_of_italy","1861-1946"]],"members":["minister","invasion_of_poland","kingdom_of_italy"],"related":["Dunedin","New_Zealand","London","United_Kingdom","Political_cartoonist","Caricaturist","Cartoonist","New_Zealand","Sydney","Australia","London","Colonel_Blimp","Satire","Nazi_Germany","Adolf_Hitler","Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861-1946)","Benito_Mussolini","Soviet_Union","Joseph_Stalin","Australia","The_Bulletin","Henry_Cadbury","The_Evening_Standard","World_War_II","Italy","Germany","The_Black_Book","Dunedin","Christchurch","Christchurch_Boys'_High_School","The_Bulletin","Billy_Hughes","Henry_Cadbury","Max_Aitken","Austrian_Civil_War","Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War","1936_Summer_Olympics","Spanish_Civil_War","Interwar_period","Nazism","Propaganda","Minister_(government)","Joseph_Goebbels","Foreign_Secretary","Lord_Halifax","United_Kingdom","Political_cartoons","Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact","Soviet_Union","Joseph_Stalin","Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)","Second_Polish_Republic","Soviet_invasion_of_Poland","Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861-1946)","Benito_Mussolini","Spanish_State","Francisco_Franco","Operation_Barbarossa","Knighthood","Blue_plaque","Rebecca_West","Dunedin","New_Zealand","London","United_Kingdom"]}
