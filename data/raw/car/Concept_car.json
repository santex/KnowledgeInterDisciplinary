They are often shown at motor shows to gauge customer\nreaction to new and radical designs which may or may not be mass produced.\nGeneral Motors designer Harley Earl is generally credited with inventing the\nconcept car, and did much to popularize it through its traveling Motorama shows\nof the 1950s.\n\nConcept cars never go into production directly. In modern times all would have\nto undergo many changes before the design is finalized for the sake of\npracticality, safety and cost. A \"production-intent\" vehicle, as opposed to a\nconcept vehicle, serves this purpose.
