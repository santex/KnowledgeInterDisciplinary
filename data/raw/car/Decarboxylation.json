{"cursor":"5743","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Decarboxylation' is a chemical reaction that removes a carboxyl group and\nreleases carbon dioxide (CO 2). Usually, decarboxylation refers to a\nreaction of carboxylic acids, removing a carbon atom from a carbon chain. The\nreverse process, which is the first chemical step in photosynthesis, is called\ncarboxylation, the addition of CO 2 to a compound. Enzymes that\ncatalyze decarboxylations are called decarboxylases or, the more formal term,\ncarboxy-lyases (EC number 4.1.1).\n","linknr":190,"url":"Decarboxylation","recorded":1362543570,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Substitution reactions"],"headings":["In organic chemistry","In biochemistry","Case studies","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Decarboxylation_reaction.png/440px-Decarboxylation_reaction.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Carbon_dioxide","Carboxylic_acids","Photosynthesis","Carboxylation","Decarboxylase","Carboxy-lyases","Enzyme_Commission_number","Pyrolysis","Retrosynthesis","Homologation_reaction","Cross_coupling_reaction","Keto_acid","Barton_decarboxylation","Kolbe_electrolysis","Kochi_reaction","Hunsdiecker_reaction","Krapcho_decarboxylation","Ketonic_decarboxylation","Carboxylic_acid","Malonic_ester_synthesis","Knoevenagel_condensation","Hydrochloric_acid","Biosynthesis","Oxidative_decarboxylation","Amino_acid","Amine","Tryptophan","Tryptamine","Phenylalanine","Phenylethylamine","Tyrosine","Tyramine","Histidine","Histamine","Serine","Ethanolamine","Glutamic_acid","GABA","Lysine","Cadaverine","Arginine","Agmatine","Ornithine","Putrescine","5-HTP","Serotonin","L-DOPA","Dopamine","Citric_acid_cycle","Pyruvate","Acetyl_coenzyme_A","Oxalosuccinic_acid","Alpha-Ketoglutaric_acid","Alpha-Ketoglutaric_acid","Succinyl_coenzyme_A","Tetrahydrocannabinol","Benzene","Benzoic_acid","Ascorbic_acid","Cyclohexenone","Amino_acids"]}
