{"cursor":"29629","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Palliative care' (from Latin palliare, to cloak) is an area of healthcare that\nfocuses on relieving and preventing the suffering of patients. Unlike hospice\ncare, 'palliative medicine' is appropriate for patients in all disease stages,\nincluding those undergoing treatment for curable illnesses and those living with\nchronic diseases, as well as patients who are nearing the end of life.\nPalliative medicine utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to patient care,\nrelying on input from physicians, pharmacists, nurses, chaplains, social\nworkers, psychologists, and other allied health professionals in formulating a\nplan of care to relieve suffering in all areas of a patient's life. This\nmultidisciplinary approach allows the palliative care team to address physical,\nemotional, spiritual, and social concerns that arise with advanced illness.\n\nMedications and treatments are said to have a palliative effect if they relieve\nsymptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause.\nThis can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or something as simple\nas morphine to treat the pain of broken leg or ibuprofen to treat aching related\nto an influenza (flu) infection.\n\nAlthough the concept of palliative care is not new, most physicians have\ntraditionally concentrated on trying to cure patients. Treatments for the\nalleviation of symptoms were viewed as hazardous and seen as inviting addiction\nand other unwanted side effects.\n\nThe focus on a patient's quality of life has increased greatly during the past\ntwenty years. In the United States today, 55% of hospitals with more than 100\nbeds offer a palliative-care program, Center to\nAdvance Palliative Care, www.capc.org and nearly one-fifth of community\nhospitals have palliative-care programs. A relatively recent\ndevelopment is the concept of a dedicated health care team that is entirely\ngeared toward palliative treatment: a palliative-care team.\n","linknr":486,"url":"Palliative_care","recorded":1362582369,"links":49,"instances":["medicine","medicine","mood"],"pdf":["http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf","http://www.abms.org/News_and_Events/downloads/NewSubcertPalliativeMed.pdf","http://www.boardcertifieddocs.com/pdf/Resources_guide_physicians.pdf"],"categories":["Palliative medicine|","Hospice"],"headings":["Scope of the term","Comparison with hospice care","History","Indications","Practice","Acceptance","Internet resources","See also","Footnotes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/13px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["adverse_effect","medicine"],["specialty","medicine"],["depression","mood"]],"members":["adverse_effect","specialty","depression"],"related":["Latin","Hospice_care","Clinical_pharmacy","Pharmaceutical_drug","Symptom","Disease","World_Health_Organization","Adverse_effect_(medicine)","Nausea","Chemotherapy","Cancer","Renal_disease","Chronic_heart_failure","Neurology","Hospice_care_in_the_United_States","Pain_management","Hospice","Hospice","Ireland","London","United_Kingdom","St._Christopher's_Hospice","Cicely_Saunders","Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act","Specialty_(medicine)","Professional_organizations","American_Society_of_Clinical_Oncology","Performance_status","Evidence-based_medicine","Clinical_trial","Visual_analog_scale","Pain","Nausea","Depression_(mood)","Anxiety","Drowsiness","Appetite","Well-being","Shortness_of_breath","Cicely_Saunders","Suffering","Social_worker","Mental_health_counselor","Chaplain","Grief_counseling","Physician","Clinical_pharmacy","Registered_nurses","Nursing_assistants","Social_worker","Hospice_chaplain","Family","Hospice_and_palliative_medicine","Catastrophic_injury","Voluntary_caregiver","Respite_care","Nursing_home","American_Board_of_Hospice_and_Palliative_Medicine","American_Board_of_Medical_Specialties","Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine","American_Osteopathic_Association_Bureau_of_Osteopathic_Specialists","Euthanasia","Children's_hospice","Elderly_care","Elisabeth_KÃ¼bler-Ross","Florence_Wald","Hospice_and_palliative_medicine","Hospice_chaplain","Medical_ethics","Pain_management","Palliative_sedation","Robert_Twycross"]}
