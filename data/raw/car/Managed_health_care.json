{"cursor":"21030","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe term 'managed care' or 'managed health care' is used in the United States to\ndescribe a variety of techniques intended to reduce the cost of providing health\nbenefits and improve the quality of care (\"managed care techniques\") for\norganizations that use those techniques or provide them as services to other\norganizations (\"managed care organization\" or \"MCO\"), or to describe systems of\nfinancing and delivering health care to enrollees organized around managed care\ntechniques and concepts (\"managed care delivery systems\"). \n\n...intended to reduce unnecessary health care costs through a variety of\nmechanisms, including: economic incentives for physicians and patients to select\nless costly forms of care; programs for reviewing the medical necessity of\nspecific services; increased beneficiary cost sharing; controls on inpatient\nadmissions and lengths of stay; the establishment of cost-sharing incentives for\noutpatient surgery; selective contracting with health care providers; and the\nintensive management of high-cost health care cases. The programs may be\nprovided in a variety of settings, such as Health Maintenance Organizations and\nPreferred Provider\nOrganizations. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=managed%20care Managed\nCare Programs]. National Library of Medicine. \n\nThe growth of managed care in the U.S. was spurred by the enactment of the\nHealth Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. While managed care techniques were\npioneered by health maintenance organizations, they are now used by a variety\nof private health benefit programs. Managed care is now nearly ubiquitous in\nthe U.S, but has attracted controversy because it has largely failed in the\noverall goal of controlling medical costs. Proponents and critics are also\nsharply divided on managed care's overall impact on the quality of U.S. health\ncare delivery.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Managed_health_care","recorded":1362568330,"links":20,"instances":["usa_health_system","healthcare","health"],"pdf":["http://www.kff.org/insurance/7527/upload/7527.pdf","http://www.kff.org/insurance/upload/7670.pdf","http://www.ahipbelieves.com/media/The%20Factors%20Fueling%20Rising%20Healthcare%20Costs.pdf"],"categories":["Insurance","Managed care|","Healthcare quality"],"headings":["History","Managed care techniques","Types of network-based managed care programs","Impacts","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["disease_management","health"],["case_management","usa_health_system"],["capitation","healthcare"],["capitation","healthcare"]],"members":["case_management","capitation","disease_management"],"related":["United_States","Health_care","Health_Maintenance_Organizations","Preferred_provider_organization","United_States","Health_Maintenance_Organization_Act_of_1973","Paul_Starr","Paul_M._Ellwood,_Jr.","Health_Maintenance_Organization_Act_of_1973","America's_Health_Insurance_Plans","America's_Health_Insurance_Plans","Integrated_delivery_system","Utilization_review","America's_Health_Insurance_Plans","America's_Health_Insurance_Plans","The_New_York_Times","Disease_management_(health)","Case_management_(USA_health_system)","Workplace_wellness","Patient_education","Utilization_management","Indemnity","Group_practice_without_walls","Independent_practice_association","Management_services_organization","Physician_practice_management_company","HMO","Richard_M._Nixon","Health_Maintenance_Organization_Act_of_1973","Medical_doctor","Hospital","Primary_care_physician","ERISA","Federal_preemption","Medical_malpractice","Capitation_(healthcare)","Fee-for-service","Evidence-based_medicine","Capitation_(healthcare)","Capitated_reimbursement","Health_care_in_the_United_States","Health_insurance_in_the_United_States","Independent_medical_review","Medical_care_ratio","Nursing_and_Health_Care_Management","Sicko","URAC"]}
