The cells that comprise cardiac muscle, called\n'cardiomyocytes' or '[[myocardiocyte]]s', only contain one, unique\nnucleus. Pollard, Thomas D. and Earnshaw, William. C., \"Cell Biology\".\nPhiladelphia: Saunders. 2007. Coordinated contractions of\ncardiac muscle cells in the heart propel blood out of the atria and ventricles\nto the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary\ncirculatory systems. This complex of actions makes up the systole of the heart.\n\nCardiac muscle cells, like all tissues in the body, rely on an ample blood\nsupply to deliver oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste products such as\ncarbon dioxide. The coronary arteries fulfill this function.\n","linknr":536,"url":"Myocardium","recorded":1362667256,"links":52,"instances":["medical","medicine","medical","heart","heart"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cardiac anatomy","Muscular system","Cardiac electrophysiology","Muscle tissue"],"headings":["Metabolism","Appearance","Role of calcium in contraction","Regeneration of heart muscle cells","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Glanzstreifen.jpg/250px-Glanzstreifen.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Dogcardiacmuscle400.jpg/250px-Dogcardiacmuscle400.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["atrium","heart"],["ventricle","heart"],["systole","medicine"],["fatigue","medical"],["hypoxia","medical"],["ventricle","heart"]],"members":["hypoxia","systole","fatigue","ventricle","atrium"],"related":["Striated_muscle","Heart","Skeletal_muscle","Smooth_muscle","Muscular_contraction","Blood","Atrium_(heart)","Ventricle_(heart)","Circulatory_system","Systole_(medicine)","Carbon_dioxide","Coronary_arteries","Fatigue_(medical)","Mitochondrion","Aerobic_respiration","Oxidative_phosphorylation","Myoglobin","Oxygen","Ischaemia","Basal_metabolic_rate","Anaerobic_metabolism","Hypoxia_(medical)","Ventricle_(heart)","Fat","Fatty_acids","Triglycerides","Carbohydrates","Glucose","Amino_acids","Ketone_bodies","Starvation","Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide","Pyruvate","Diabetes","GLUT4","Myosin","Actin","Myofibrils","Sarcomere","Sarcomere","Electron_microscopy","T-tubules","Sarcoplasmic_reticulum","Excitation-contraction_coupling","Myocytes","Syncytium","Action_potentials","Adherens_junctions","Fascia_adherens","Desmosomes","Gap_junctions","Arrhythmogenic_Right_Ventricular_Cardiomyopathy","Light_microscopy","Skeletal_muscle","Action_potential","Sarcolemma","L-type_calcium_channel","Calcium","Calcium-induced_calcium_release","Sarcoplasmic_reticulum","Troponin","Skeletal_muscle","Stockholm","Carbon_14"]}
