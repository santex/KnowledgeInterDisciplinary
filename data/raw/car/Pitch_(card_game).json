Historically, Pitch started as \"Blind All Fours\", a very\nsimple All Fours variant that is still played in England as a pub game. The\nmodern game involving a bidding phase and setting back a party's score if the\nbid is not reached came up in the middle of the 19th century and is more\nprecisely known as 'Auction Pitch' or 'Setback'. Whereas All Fours started as a\ntwo-player game, Pitch is most popular for three to five players. .\nFour can play individually or in fixed partnerships, depending in part on\nregional preferences. Auction Pitch is played in numerous\nvariations that vary the deck used, provide methods for improving players'\nhands, or expand the scoring system. Some of these variants gave rise to a new\ngame known as Pedro or Cinch.\n","linknr":270,"url":"Pitch_(card_game)","recorded":1364118123,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/United_States","/wiki/Smear_(card_game)","/wiki/Trick-taking","/wiki/All_Fours","/wiki/Pedro_(card_game)","/wiki/Cinch_(card_game)","/wiki/Phat_(card_game)","/wiki/Trick-taking_game","/wiki/All_Fours","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-mcleod-2","/wiki/Pedro_(card_game)","/wiki/Cinch_(card_game)","#Pitch_without_auction","#Commercial_Pitch","#Auction_Pitch","#Common_minor_variations","#Partnership_Pitch","#Off-Jack.2C_Jokers_and_odd_trumps","#Scoring_variations","#Miscellaneous_options","#Card_distribution_variations","#Players_start_with_six_cards","#Players_start_with_more_than_six_cards","#Named_variants","#Ten-Point","#Oklahoma_Ten-Point","#Campbell_Ten-Point","#Overview","#The_deal","#Play","#Scoring","#Common_Terms","#Razzle-Dazzle","#Wahoo_Ten-Point","#Susqy_River_Ten-Point","#Six-Point","#Contway_6-point","#Overview_2","#Partners","#The_Deal_2","#Play_2","#Scoring_2","#Other_point_variants","#Cell_Pitch","#Maryland_Jack","#High_Five","#Seven_Point","#Partnership_Draw_Pitch","#Nine-Five_variants","#Nine-Five","#Nine-Five_Regional_.28Northwest_Connecticut.29","#Further_variations","#Reverse_Pitch","#Backdoor_Win","#Capture_Low","#Two-Trump","#Strategy","#Notes","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_note-commonvariations-3","/wiki/Whist","#cite_note-4","#cite_note-5","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=2","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-commonvariations-3","#cite_note-6","#cite_note-7","/wiki/Trump_(card_game)","#cite_note-8","/wiki/Revoke","#cite_note-eb1911-9","#cite_note-eb1911-9","#cite_note-mcleod-2","#cite_note-eb1911-9","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=5","#cite_note-rigal2005-234-10","#cite_note-rigal2005-234-10","#cite_note-rigal2005-234-10","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=6","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Euchre","/wiki/Smear_(card_game)","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=7","#cite_note-commonvariations-3","#cite_note-commonvariations-3","#cite_note-commonvariations-3","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=8","#cite_note-12","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=9","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=10","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=11","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=12","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=13","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=14","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=15","/wiki/Carthage,_MO","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=16","/wiki/Joker_(playing_card)","/wiki/Ace","/wiki/King_(playing_card)","/wiki/Queen_(playing_card)","/wiki/Jack_(playing_card)","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=17","/wiki/Face_cards","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=18","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=19","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=20","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=21","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=22","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=23","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=24","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=25","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=26","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=27","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=28","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=29","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=30","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=31","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=32","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&action=edit&section=33","/w/index.php?title=Pitch_(card_game)&ac
