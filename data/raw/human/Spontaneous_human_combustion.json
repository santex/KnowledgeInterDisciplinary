There have been about 200 cited cases âAblaze!: The Mysterious Fires of Spontaneous Human Combustionâ\nArnold, Larry E. 1995 ISBN 0-87131-789-3 worldwide over a period of around\n300 years.\n\nThere are many hypotheses that attempt to explain human spontaneous combustion:\n* Natural explanations based on unknown or otherwise unobserved phenomena (e.g.\n  that the production of abnormally concentrated gas or raised levels of blood\n  alcohol might cause spontaneous ignition) *Natural explanations relating to\n  health and lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking, not consuming adequate levels of\n  water etc.)\n* Natural explanations that involve an external source of ignition (e.g. the\n  victim was drunk and dropped a cigarette)\n\nObjections to natural explanations typically refer to the degree of burning of\nthe body with respect to its surroundings. Indeed, one of the common markers of\na case of SHC is that the body â or part of it â suffered an extraordinarily\nlarge degree of burning while the surroundings or the lower limbs remained\ncomparatively undamaged. Supernatural explanations of\nspontaneous human combustion remain popular.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Spontaneous_human_combustion","recorded":1362675941,"links":41,"instances":["season_4","irish_author","novel","skeptic"],"pdf":["http://www.mcri.org/CMSuploads/Brian%20J.%20Ford%20-%20Solving%20the%20Mystery%20of%20Spontaneous%20Human%20Combustion-85047.pdf","http://www.mcri.org/CMSuploads/Brian%20J.%20Ford%20-%20Solving%20the%20Mystery%20of%20Spontaneous%20Human%20Combustion-85047.pdf","http://www.brianjford.com/a-1208-NSci-SHC.pdf","http://www.brianjford.com/a-1208-NSci-SHC.pdf"],"categories":["Forteana","Exploding animals|Human","Causes of death","Combustion"],"headings":["Characteristics","Forensic investigation","Suggested explanations","In fiction","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["brian_dunning","skeptic"],["wieland","novel"],["michael_scott","irish_author"],["fringe","tv_series"],["fringe","season_4"]],"members":["fringe","michael_scott","wieland","brian_dunning"],"related":["Combustion","Spontaneous_combustion","Death_by_burning","Joe_Nickell","International_Association_of_Arson_Investigators","Wick_effect","Benjamin_Radford","Brian_Dunning_(skeptic)","Cigarettes","Wick_effect","Subcutaneous","Scalding","Brian_J._Ford","Ketosis","Alcoholism","Acetone","Flammable","Oxidation-reduction","Ball_lightning","Charles_Brockden_Brown","Wieland_(novel)","Nikolai_Gogol","Charles_Dickens","Jules_Verne","Mockumentary","Bob_Shaw","Michael_Scott_(Irish_author)","Alexis_Stamatis","Fringe_(TV_series)","Fringe_(season_4)","Nanite","Playstation","Parasite_Eve","Mitochondria","Exploding_animal","List_of_magazines_of_anomalous_phenomena","Self-immolation"]}
