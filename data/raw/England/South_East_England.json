It consists of Berkshire,\nBuckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire,\nSurrey and West Sussex. As with the other regions of England, apart from Greater\nLondon, the South East has no elected government and few powers. The Labour\nParty's proposals during the general election of 1997 to create elected regional\ngovernments were abandoned.\n\nIt is the third largest region of England, with an area of 19,096 kmÂ², and is\nalso the most populous with a total population of over eight and a half million\n(2011). The headquarters for the region's governmental bodies are in Guildford,\nand the region contains seven cities: Brighton and Hove, Canterbury, Chichester,\nOxford, Portsmouth, Southampton and Winchester, though other major settlements\ninclude Reading and Milton Keynes. Its proximity to London and connections to\nseveral national motorways have led to South East England becoming an economic\nhub, with the largest economy in the country outside the capital. It is the\nlocation of Gatwick Airport, the UK's second-busiest airport, and its coastline\nalong the English Channel provides numerous ferry crossings to mainland Europe.\n\nThe region is known for its countryside, which include the North Downs and the\nChiltern Hills as well as two national parks: New Forest National Park and South\nDowns National Park. The River Thames flows through the region and its basin is\nknown as the Thames Valley. It is also the location for a number of internationally-\nrenowned places of interest, some of which include HMS Victory in Portsmouth,\nCliveden in Buckinghamshire, Thorpe Park and RHS Wisley in Surrey, Blenheim\nPalace in Oxfordshire, Windsor Castle in Berkshire, Leeds Castle, the White\nCliffs of Dover and Canterbury Cathedral in Kent, Brighton Pier in East Sussex,\nand Wakehurst Place in West Sussex. The region has several universities, the\nmost famous being the University of Oxford, with its iconic buildings and\nboating on the Thames.\n\nSouth East England is host to various sporting events, including the annual\nHenley Royal Regatta, Royal Ascot and the Epsom Derby, and sporting venues\ninclude Wentworth Golf Club and Brands Hatch. Some of the events of the 2012\nSummer Olympics were held in the South East, including the rowing at Eton Dorney\nand part of the cycling road race in the Surrey Hills.\n","linknr":2131,"url":"South_East_England","recorded":1362672233,"links":120,"instances":["european_parliament_constituency","brighton","company","district","district","borough","borough","district","england","uk_radio_station","uk_parliament_constituency","clothing","england","borough","borough","vacuum","computing","aylesbury","borough","great_britain","radio_network","borough","great_britain","uk_parliament_constituency","district","database","brand","united_kingdom","computing","district","retailer","district","borough","great_britain","shop","milton_keynes_village","district","uk","uk_parliament_constituency","hms_hornbill","shopping_centre","marque","borough","district","spacecraft","united_kingdom_census","district","guildford_railway_station","borough","bar","company","uk","uk_parliament_constituency","company","charity","district","district","automobile","borough","great_britain","basingstoke","bed_retailer","england","company","england","appliances","company","retailer","uk","borough","hastings"],"pdf":["http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file50736.pdf","http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file50736.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/gva1208.pdf","http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/gva1208.pdf"],"categories":["South
