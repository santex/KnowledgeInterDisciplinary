{"cursor":"2793","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Emphatic consonant' is a term widely used in Semitic linguistics to describe\none of a series of obstruent consonants which originally contrasted with series\nof both voiced and voiceless obstruents. In specific Semitic languages, the\nmembers of this series may be realized as pharyngealized, velarized, ejective,\nor plain voiced or voiceless consonants. It is also used, to a lesser extent, to\ndescribe cognate series in other Afro-Asiatic languages, where they are\ntypically realized as either ejective or implosive consonants.\n\nIn Semitic studies, they are commonly transcribed using the convention of\nplacing a dot under the closest plain obstruent consonant in the Latin\nalphabet. With respect to particular Semitic and Afro-Asiatic languages, this\nterm has come to be used more specifically to describe the particular phonetic\nfeature which distinguishes these consonants from other consonants. Thus, in\nArabic emphasis is synonymous with a secondary articulation involving\nretraction of the dorsum or root of the tongue, which has variously been\ndescribed as velarization or pharyngealization depending on where the locus of\nthe retraction is assumed to be.\n\nWithin Arabic, the emphatic consonants have been reported as varying in phonetic\nrealization from dialect to dialect, but are typically realized as\npharyngealized consonants. In Ethiopian and Modern South Arabian languages, they\nare realized as ejective consonants. While these sounds do not necessarily share\nany particular phonetic properties in common, most historically derive from a\ncommon source.\n\nFive such \"emphatic\" phonemes are reconstructed for Proto-Semitic: {|\nclass=\"wikitable\"\n!
