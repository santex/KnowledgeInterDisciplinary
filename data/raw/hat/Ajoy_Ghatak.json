His undergraduate text on [[Optics]] has been\ntranslated to Chinese and Persian and his monograph on Inhomogeneous [[Optical\nWaveguide]]s (coauthored with Professor Sodha) has been translated to Chinese\nand Russian. In 1995, he was elected Fellow of the Optical Society of\nAmerica \"for distinguished service to optics education and for his contribution\nto the understanding of propagation characteristics of gradient index media,\nfibers and integrated optical devices\".\n\nHe received his M.Sc from Delhi University and Ph.D from Cornell University.\nAfter a short stint as a Research Associate at Brookhaven National Laboratory,\nProfessor Ghatak joined the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1966. He retired as an Emeritus Professor of Physics at IIT Delhi in\n2007.\n\nProfessor Ghatak now spends his time writing books and doing special guest\nlectures at universities and colleges in India and\ninternationally.\n","linknr":170,"url":"Ajoy_Ghatak","recorded":1362485892,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.mirandahouse.ac.in/DSKC/ALOP_ASIA_2006_REPORT.pdf","http://www.mirandahouse.ac.in/DSKC/ALOP_ASIA_2006_REPORT.pdf","http://www.phy.iitkgp.ernet.in/ptaccd2/Speakers_Biodata/AKGhatak_Bio.pdf","http://www.phy.iitkgp.ernet.in/ptaccd2/Speakers_Biodata/AKGhatak_Bio.pdf"],"categories":["Articles created via the Article Wizard","1939 births","Living people","Indian physicists","Recipients of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in Physical Science"],"headings":["Selected awards and honors","Selected publications<ref>The full list of publications can be found [http://www.flipkart.com/search-book?dd=0&query=ajoy+ghatak here] (accessed 8 November 2010)</ref>","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Ghatak-Ajoy-sm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Lucknow","New_Delhi","India","Physics","Indian_Institute_of_Technology","Delhi_University","Cornell_University","Hans_Bethe","Indian_people","Physicist","Optical_Society_of_America","Delhi_University","Cornell_University","Brookhaven_National_Laboratory","Indian_Institute_of_Technology,_Delhi","SPIE","Optical_Society_of_America","International_Commission_for_Optics","Shanti_Swarup_Bhatnagar_Prize_for_Science_and_Technology","Council_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research","Lucknow"]}
