The process of removing the phosphate\ngroup is called [[phosphorylation|dephosphorylation]]. As the name suggests,\nalkaline phosphatases are most effective in an alkaline environment. It is\nsometimes used synonymously as 'basic phosphatase'.\n","linknr":669,"url":"Alkaline_phosphatase","recorded":1362503129,"links":36,"instances":["menopause","biochemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.chempap.org/papers/565a326.pdf","http://www.chempap.org/papers/565a326.pdf","http://www.genetics.org/content/96/2/353.full.pdf","http://www.genetics.org/content/96/2/353.full.pdf"],"categories":["EC 3.1.3","Liver function tests"],"headings":["Bacterial","Use in research","Human","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/1ALK.png/220px-1ALK.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/PDB_1alk_EBI.jpg/220px-PDB_1alk_EBI.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["denaturation","biochemistry"],["hormone_replacement_therapy","menopause"]],"members":["hormone_replacement_therapy","denaturation"],"related":["N-terminus","C-terminus","Protein_dimer","Hydrolase","Enzyme","Phosphate","Nucleotides","Proteins","Alkaloids","Alkaline","Bacterium","Periplasmic_space","Cell_membrane","Denaturation_(biochemistry)","Chemical_decomposition","Organic_molecule","Regulation","Metabolism","Laboratory","Mutant","Cattle","Shrimp","Calf-intestinal_alkaline_phosphatase","Placenta","Molecular_biology","DNA","DNA","Ligation","DNA","Radiolabeling","Enzyme_immunoassay","Pluripotent_stem_cells","Cell_membrane","Alkaline_phosphatase_staining","Embryonic_stem_cells","Embryonal_carcinoma","Para-Nitrophenylphosphate","Placenta","Homoarginine","Levamisole","Liver","Bile_duct","Kidney","Bone","Placenta","ALPI","ALPL","ALPP","International_unit","Bile_duct","Osteoblast","Paget's_disease_of_bone","Celiac_Disease","Isoenzyme","Electrophoresis","Seminoma","Rickets","Hypophosphatasia","Autosomal_recessive","Menopause","Hormone_replacement_therapy_(menopause)","Osteoporosis","Heart_surgery","Malnutrition","Hypomagnesemia","Hypothyroidism","Anemia","Achondroplasia","Cretinism","Enteritis","Pernicious_anemia","Aplastic_anemia","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Wilson's_disease","White_blood_cell","Polycythemia_vera","Essential_thrombocytosis","Primary_myelofibrosis","Leukemoid_reaction","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Paroxysmal_nocturnal_hemoglobinuria","Acute_myelogenous_leukaemia","Liver_function_tests","Acid_phosphatase"]}
