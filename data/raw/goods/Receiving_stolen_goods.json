{"cursor":"7326","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" checking for stolen goods at a flea market]]\n\n'Possession of stolen goods' is a crime in which an individual has bought, been\ngiven, or acquired stolen goods some other way.\n\nIn many countries, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property\nand knew they were stolen, then the individual is typically charged with a\nmisdemeanor or felony, depending on the value of the stolen goods. If the\nindividual did not know the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to\nthe owner and the individual is not prosecuted. However, there are often\nexceptions, due to the difficulty of proving or disproving an individual's\nknowledge that the goods were stolen.\n","linknr":210,"url":"Receiving_stolen_goods","recorded":1362570591,"links":14,"instances":["consolidation","criminal","criminal_law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Theft","Crimes","Property crimes"],"headings":["Nature of offence by country","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Vancouver_Police_at_the_Hastings_%22Flea_Market%22_for_Stolen_Goods.jpg/215px-Vancouver_Police_at_the_Hastings_%22Flea_Market%22_for_Stolen_Goods.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["criminal_law","consolidation","scotland_act_1995"],["intention","criminal_law"],["fence","criminal"]],"members":["criminal_law","fence","intention"],"related":["Flea_market","Criminal_Code_of_Canada","Criminal_Law_(Consolidation)_(Scotland)_Act_1995","Theft","Robbery","Position_of_trust","Embezzlement","Fraud","United_States","Federal_crime","Interstate_commerce","Government","Beyond_a_reasonable_doubt","U.S._state","Ohio","Intention_(criminal_law)","Felony","Possession_of_stolen_property","Fence_(criminal)","Handling_stolen_goods"]}
