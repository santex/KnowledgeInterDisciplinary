It is designed to launch payloads weighing up to into low-Earth\norbit. It is scheduled to make its first flight in March 2013.\n\nNASA awarded to Orbital a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS)\ncontract in 2008 to demonstrate delivery of cargo to the International Space Station. For these COTS missions Orbital intends\nto use Antares to launch its Cygnus spacecraft. In addition, Antares will\ncompete for small-to-medium missions. Aviation Week and Space Technology,\nFeb. 25, 2008, p. 22 On Dec. 12, 2011 Orbital Sciences renamed the launch\nvehicle \"Antares\" from the previous designation of Taurus II, after the star of\nthe same name.
