{"cursor":"46468","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\n'Biological warfare' (BW) â also known as 'germ warfare' â is the use of\nbiological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi with\nintent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war.\nBiological weapons (often termed \"bio-weapons\", \"biological threat agents\", or\n\"bio-agents\") are living organisms or replicating entities (viruses) that\nreproduce or replicate within their host victims. Entomological (insect) warfare\nis also considered a type of Biological Weapon.\n\nBiological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or\ntactical advantage over an adversary, either by threats or by actual\ndeployments. Like some of the chemical weapons, biological weapons may also be\nuseful as area denial weapons. These agents may be lethal or non-lethal, and may\nbe targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire\npopulation. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by nation\nstates or by non-national groups. In the latter case, or if a nation-state uses\nit clandestinely, it may also be considered bioterrorism.\n\nThere is an overlap between BW and chemical warfare, as the use of toxins\nproduced by living organisms is considered under the provisions of both the\nBiological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Toxins and\nPsychochemical weapons are often referred to as midspectrum agents. Unlike\nbioweapons, these midspectrum agents do not reproduce in their host and are\ntypically characterized by shorter incubation periods. Gray, Colin.\n(2007).
