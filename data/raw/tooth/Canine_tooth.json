However, they can appear more flattened, causing\nthem to resemble incisors and leading them to be called incisiform. They evolved\nand are used primarily for firmly holding food in order to tear it apart, and\noccasionally as weapons. They are often the largest teeth in a mammal's mouth.\nMost species that develop them normally have four per individual, two in the\nupper jaw and two in the lower, separated within each jaw by its incisors;\nhumans and dogs are examples. In most animals, canines are the anterior-most\nteeth in the maxillary bone. Narwhals provide an extreme example, where one\ncanine tooth, usually the left, erupts into a long spiral horn up to\nlong.\n\nThe four canines in humans are the two maxillary canines and the two\nmandibular canines.\n","linknr":240,"url":"Canine_tooth","recorded":1362373306,"links":56,"instances":["tooth"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of teeth","Mammal anatomy"],"headings":["Details","Sexual dimorphism","In non-mammals","Additional images","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Azawakh_K9.jpg/250px-Azawakh_K9.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Illu_mouth.jpg/120px-Illu_mouth.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Gray157.png/120px-Gray157.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Gray187.png/74px-Gray187.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Gray1001.png/109px-Gray1001.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Dentistry_stub.svg/14px-Dentistry_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["molar","tooth"]],"members":["molar"],"related":["Dog","Canidae","Mammal","Tooth","Incisor","Incisor","Maxilla","Narwhal","Maxillary_canine","Mandibular_canine","Incisor","Labial","Lingual","Musk-deer","Camel","Horse","Boar","Walrus","Deciduous_teeth","Incisor","Premolar","Molar_(tooth)"]}
