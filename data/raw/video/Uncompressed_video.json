The purpose is significant higher quality\ncompared to lossy compression, allowing even resolution upscaling.\n\nThe HDMI specification specifies several modes of uncompressed digital video.\nAlthough often HD video capable cameras include a HDMI interface for playback or\neven live preview, the image processor and the video processor of cameras usable\nfor uncompressed video must be able to deliver the full image resolution at the\nspecified frame rate in realtime without any missing frames causing judder.\n\nCurrently uncompressed video is supported by Nikon DSLRs with the Expeed 3 (FR)\nimage/video processor (currently Nikon D4, Nikon D800/D800E, Nikon D600 and\nNikon D5200), the Canon EOS-1D C and professional video cameras like Arri Alexa.\n","linknr":527,"url":"Uncompressed_video","recorded":1362538451,"links":16,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/pdf/msu_lossless_codecs_comparison_2007_eng.pdf"],"categories":["High-definition television","Video compression","Film and video technology","â€ªVideo signal","Data compression","Digital television"],"headings":["Characteristics","Storage and Data Rates for Uncompressed Video","HDMI 1.3a Specifications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Video","Video_compression","Digital_camera","Data_stream","File_format","Digital_video_camera","Lossy_compression","Image_scaling","HDMI","HD_video","Live_preview","Image_processor","Video_processor","Image_resolution","Frame_rate","Nikon_D4","Nikon_D800","Nikon_D800E","Nikon_D600","Nikon_D5200","Canon_EOS-1D_C","Arri_Alexa","MPEG","Video_quality","Image_resolution","Acutance","Raw_image_format","Motion_blur","Motion_compensation","Compression_artifact","Raw","Lossless_compression","Comparison_of_file_archivers","Video_codec","Constant_bitrate","Data_signaling_rate","Color_depth","Image_resolution","Refresh_frequency","Gigabit_per_second","Megabyte","HDMI","Uncompressed_audio"]}
