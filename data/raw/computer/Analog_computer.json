{"cursor":"35904","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":". The 'Norden bombsight' was a highly sophisticated optical/mechanical analog\n  computer used by the United States Army Air Force during World War II, the\n  Korean War, and the Vietnam War to aid the pilot of a bomber aircraft in\n  dropping bombs accurately.]]\n\n\nAn 'analog computer' is a form of computer that uses the continuously changeable\naspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic\nquantities to model the problem being solved. In contrast, digital computers\nrepresent varying quantities symbolically, as their numerical values change. As\nan analog computer does not use discrete (exact) values, but rather continuous\n(approximate) values, processes cannot be reproduced with exact equivalence, as\nthey can with Turing machines.\n\nAnalog computers were widely used in scientific and industrial applications\nwhere digital computers of the time lacked sufficient performance. Analog\ncomputers can have a very wide range of complexity. Slide rules and nomographs\nare the simplest, while naval gunfire control computers and large hybrid\ndigital/analog computers were among the most complicated. Systems for process\ncontrol and protective relays used analog computation to perform control and\nprotective functions.\n","linknr":411,"url":"Analog_computer","recorded":1362669397,"links":59,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","instrument","military","device","computing","engineer","ac_power","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/pubs/00326866.pdf","http://oro.open.ac.uk/5795/1/bletchley_paper.pdf"],"categories":["History
