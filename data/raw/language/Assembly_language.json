{"cursor":"52865","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":See the [[#Related terminology|terminology]] section below for information\nregarding inconsistent use of the terms assembly and assembler.\n\nAn 'assembly language' is a low-level programming language for a computer,\nmicrocontroller, or other programmable device, in which each statement\ncorresponds to a single machine code instruction. Each assembly language is\nspecific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most high-level\nprogramming languages, which are generally portable across multiple systems.\n\nAssembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program\nreferred to as an [[#Assembler|assembler]]; the conversion process is referred\nto as assembly, or assembling the code.\n\nAssembly language uses a mnemonic to represent each low-level machine operation\nor opcode. Some opcodes require one or more operands as part of the instruction,\nand most assemblers can take labels and symbols as operands to represent\naddresses and constants, instead of hard coding them into the program. 'Macro\nassemblers' include a macroinstruction facility so that assembly language text\ncan be pre-assigned to a name, and that name can be used to insert the text into\nother code. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program\ndevelopment, to control the assembly process, and to aid debugging.\n","linknr":626,"url":"Assembly_language","recorded":1362891455,"links":76,"instances":["programming_language","computer_science","mathematics","operating_system","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","computing","computing","computer_language","computer_science","computer_scientist","data_structure","computer_science","file_format","programming","x86_instruction","computer_science","programming_language","unix","computing","computing","math","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.davidsalomon.name/assem.advertis/asl.pdf","http://www.sparc.com/standards/V8.pdf","http://www.sparc.com/standards/V8.pdf","http://www.davidsalomon.name/assem.advertis/asl.pdf","http://www.davidsalomon.name/assem.advertis/asl.pdf","http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs422/doc/art-of-asm/pdf/CH08.PDF","http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs422/doc/art-of-asm/pdf/CH08.PDF","http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases-noredirect/pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf"],"categories":["Assembly
