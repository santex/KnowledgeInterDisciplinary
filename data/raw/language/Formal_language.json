{"cursor":"22670","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a 'formal language' is a set\nof strings of symbols that may be constrained by rules that are specific for a\nparticular formal language.\n\nThe alphabet of a formal language is the set of symbols, letters, or tokens from\nwhich the strings of the language may be formed; frequently it is required to be\nfinite. The strings formed from this alphabet are called words, and the words\nthat belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed\nwords or [[well-formed formula]]s. A formal language is often defined by means\nof a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, also\ncalled its formation rule.\n\nThe field of 'formal language theory' studies primarily the purely syntactical\naspects of such languagesâthat is, their internal structural patterns. Formal\nlanguage theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the\nsyntactic regularities of natural languages. In computer science, formal\nlanguages are used among others as the basis for defining programming languages\nand formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of\nthe language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or\nsemantics. In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically\ndefined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of\nthe formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational\npower. In logic and the foundations of mathematics, formal languages are used to\nrepresent the syntax of axiomatic systems, and mathematical formalism is the\nphilosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation\nof formal languages in this way.\n","linknr":681,"url":"Formal_language","recorded":1362372647,"links":56,"instances":["computer_programming","mathematics","computer_science","computer_science","set_theory","logic","logic","mathematics","mathematical_logic","formal","mathematics","formal_languages","computer_science","set_theory","mathematical_logic","mathematics","set_theory"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lkontor/noam/Mateescu-Salomaa.pdf","http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~jep/PDF/HandBook.pdf"],"categories":["Formal
