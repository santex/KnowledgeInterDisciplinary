{"cursor":"117806","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Evolutionary psychology' ('EP') is an approach in the social and natural\nsciences that examines psychological traits such as memory, perception, and\nlanguage from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify which\nhuman psychological traits are evolved adaptations â that is, the functional\nproducts of natural selection or sexual selection. Adaptationist thinking about\nphysiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common\nin evolutionary biology. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking\nto psychology, arguing that the mind has a modular structure similar to that of\nthe body, with different modular adaptations serving different functions.\nEvolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of\npsychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human\nancestral environments. Confer et al. 2010; Buss, 2005; Durrant & Ellis,\n2003; Pinker, 2002; Tooby & Cosmides, 2005\n\nThe adaptationist approach is steadily increasing as an influence in the general\nfield of psychology.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists suggest that EP is not simply a subdiscipline of\npsychology but that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational,\nmetatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology, in the\nsame way it has for biology. Duntley and Buss\n2008\n\nEvolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally\nin all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations Schacter et al. 2007, pp. 26â27 including the abilities\nto infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer\nhealthier mates, and cooperate with others. They report successful tests of\ntheoretical predictions related to such topics as infanticide, intelligence,\nmarriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, and parental\ninvestment. \"Despite this difficulty, there have been\nmany careful and informative studies of human social behavior from an\nevolutionary perspective. Infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns,\npromiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, altruism, and the allocation of\nparental care have all been explored by testing predictions derived from the\nidea that conscious and unconscious behaviours have evolved to maximize\ninclusive fitness. The findings have been impressive.\" \"social behaviour,\nanimal.\" EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online. EncyclopÃ¦dia\nBritannica, 2011. Web. 23 Jan 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550897/animal-social-\nbehaviour].\n\nThe theories and findings of EP have applications in many fields, including\neconomics, environment, health, law, management, psychiatry, politics, and\nliterature.

Buss,\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2005\n\nControversies concerning EP involve questions of testability, cognitive and\nevolutionary assumptions (such as modular functioning of the brain, and large\nuncertainty about the ancestral environment), importance of non-genetic and non-\nadaptive explanations, as well as political and ethical issues due to\ninterpretations of research
