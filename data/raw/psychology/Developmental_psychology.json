Originally concerned with\ninfants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult\ndevelopment, aging, and the entire life span. This field examines change across\na broad range of topics including motor skills and other psycho-physiological\nprocesses; cognitive development involving areas such as problem solving, moral\nunderstanding, and conceptual understanding; language acquisition; social,\npersonality, and emotional development; and self-concept and identity formation.\n3 major contexts to consider when analysing child psychology are: social\ncontext, cultural context, and socioeconomic context.\n\nDevelopmental psychology includes issues such as the extent to which development\noccurs through the gradual accumulation of knowledge versus stage-like\ndevelopment, or the extent to which children are born with innate mental\nstructures versus learning through experience. Many researchers are interested\nin the interaction between personal characteristics, the individual's behavior,\nand environmental factors including social context, and their impact on\ndevelopment; others take a more narrowly-focused approach.\n\nDevelopmental psychology informs several applied fields, including: educational\npsychology, child psychopathology, and forensic developmental psychology.\nDevelopmental psychology complements several other basic research fields in\npsychology including social psychology, cognitive psychology, ecological\npsychology, and comparative psychology.\n","linknr":913,"url":"Developmental_psychology","recorded":1362480818,"links":90,"instances":["learning_theory","sense","statistics","abstract","sociology","education","feral_child","social_science","psychology","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-11.2.pdf","http://psychology.uga.edu/people/bios/faculty/FragaszyDoc/Johnson-Pynn,%20Fragaszy%20and%20Sebree%202003%20Common%20territories%20in%20comparative%20and%20developmental%20psychology,%20Int%20J%20Comp%20Psych%2016,%201-27.pdf","http://psychology.uga.edu/people/bios/faculty/FragaszyDoc/Johnson-Pynn,%20Fragaszy%20and%20Sebree%202003%20Common%20territories%20in%20comparative%20and%20developmental%20psychology,%20Int%20J%20Comp%20Psych%2016,%201-27.pdf","http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/bibs/child.pdf"],"categories":["Developmental
