One dominant example is drug-receptor interactions as\nmodeled by\n\n: L + R \\ \\rightleftharpoons \\ L\\! \\cdot \\!R \n\nwhere L=ligand (drug), R=receptor (attachment site), reaction dynamics that can\nbe studied mathematically through tools such as free energy maps.\nPharmacodynamics is often summarized as the study of what a drug does to the\nbody, whereas pharmacokinetics is the study of what the body does to a drug.\nPharmacodynamics is sometimes abbreviated as \"PD\", while pharmacokinetics can be\nreferred to as \"PK\".
