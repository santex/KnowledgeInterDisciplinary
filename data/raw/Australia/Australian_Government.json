{"cursor":"26603","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nThe 'Government of the Commonwealth of Australia', also known as the\n'Australian Government', 'Commonwealth Government' or 'Federal Government', is\nthe administrative authority of Australia. The Commonwealth of Australia, a\nfederal constitutional monarchy under a parliamentary democracy, was formed in\n1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing British colonies,\nwhich became the six states. The terms of this agreement are embodied in the\nAustralian Constitution, which was drawn up at a Constitutional Convention and\nratified by the people of the colonies at referendums. The structure of the\nAustralian Government may be examined in light of two distinct concepts, namely\nfederalism and the separation of powers into executive, legislative, and\njudicial branches of government. Separation of powers is implied from the\nstructure of the Constitution which breaks down the branches of government into\nseparate chapters.\n","linknr":729,"url":"Australian_Government","recorded":1362665825,"links":29,"instances":["keeling_islands","australia","government","government","australia","australia","australia","australia"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Government
