It includes\nall states and mainland territories, plus some external territories, at the mean\nlow water mark.\n\nIn September 2001 the Federal Parliament passed the Migration Amendment\n(Excision from Migration Zone) Act and the Migration Amendment (Excision from\nMigration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act. These pieces of legislation\nexcised certain external territories from the migration zone, for purposes\nrelating to unauthorised arrivals. These territories included Ashmore Island,\nCartier Islands, Christmas Island, and Cocos Islands.\n\nOn 30 October 2012, the Australian Labor Party federal parliamentary caucus\nresolved to excise the entire Australian mainland from the migration zone, in\norder to remove any incentive for asylum seekers travelling from Indonesia to\ntry to reach the mainland instead of Christmas Island or other Australian\nterritories which are closer to Indonesia but excised from the migration\nzone.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Australian_migration_zone","recorded":1362677426,"links":13,"instances":["document"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Australian migration law"],"headings":["Unauthorised arrival","Effect of excision on sovereignty","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/32px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["visa","document"]],"members":["visa"],"related":["Australia","Citizen","Visa_(document)","Unauthorised_arrivals","Ashmore_Island","Cartier_Islands","Christmas_Island","Cocos_Islands","Australian_Labor_Party","Indonesia","Asylum_seekers","Refugee","UNHCR","Australian_immigration_detention_facilities","Christmas_Island","Nauru_detention_centre","Manus_Island","Boat_people","Australian_immigration_policies","Howard_Government","Rudd_Government","Temporary_protection_visa","Judicial_review","High_Court_of_Australia","Sovereignty","Norfolk_Island","Heard_Island_and_McDonald_Islands","Southern_Ocean","Australian_Antarctic_Territory","Australian_permanent_resident","Mandatory_detention_in_Australia","Pacific_Solution","Permanent_Resident_of_Norfolk_Island_visa"]}
