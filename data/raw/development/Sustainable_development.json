The term 'sustainable development' was used by the Brundtland Commission\nwhich coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable\ndevelopment: \"development that meets the needs of the present without\ncompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own\nneeds.\".

Retrieved: 2007-04-\n12\n\nSustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of\nnatural systems with the social challenges faced by humanity.

More recently, it has been\nsuggested that a more consistent analytical breakdown is to distinguish four\ndomains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability. This is\nconsistent with the UCLG move to make 'culture' the fourth domain of\nsustainability.
