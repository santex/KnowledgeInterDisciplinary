A\n TOD neighborhood typically has a center with a transit station or stop (train\n station, metro station, tram stop, or bus stop), surrounded by relatively high-\n density development with progressively lower-density development spreading\n outward from the center. TODs generally are located within a radius of one-\n quarter to one-half mile (400 to 800 m) from a transit stop, as this is\n considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians.\n\nMany of the new towns created after World War II in Japan, Sweden, and France\nhave many of the characteristics of TOD communities. In a sense, nearly all\ncommunities built on reclaimed land in the Netherlands or as exurban\ndevelopments in Denmark have had the local equivalent of TOD principles\nintegrated in their planning, including the promotion of bicycles for local use.\n\nTransit-oriented development is sometimes distinguished by some planning\nofficials from \"transit-proximate development\" (see, e.g. comments made during a\nCongressional hearing\nhttp://edf.org/documents/2698_Testimony03_03.pdf ) because it contains\nspecific features that are designed to encourage public transport use and\ndifferentiate the development from urban sprawl. Examples of these features\ninclude mixed-use development that will use transit at all times of day,\nexcellent pedestrian facilities such as high quality pedestrian crossings,\nnarrow streets, and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the\npublic transport node. Another key feature of transit-oriented development that\ndifferentiates it from \"transit-proximate development\" is reduced amounts of\nparking for personal vehicles.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"Transit-oriented_development","recorded":1362478013,"links":0,"instances":["light_rail","australia","wmata_station","bart_station","vancouver","salt_lake_city","ets","california","bart_station","wmata_station","ets","wmata_station","bart_station"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Urban studies and planning","Urban design","Sustainable development","Sustainable transport","Transit-oriented developments|","Public transport","Housing"],"headings":["TOD in cities","Equity and Housing Cost concerns","See also","References","External links"],"image":[],"tags":[["rosslyn","wmata_station"],["court_house","wmata_station"],["clarendon","wmata_station"],["pleasant_hill_/_contra_costa_centre","bart_station"],["fruitvale","bart_station"],["hayward","bart_station"],["richmond_station","california"],["trax","light_rail"],["sugarhouse","salt_lake_city"],["skytrain","vancouver"],["westbrook","c-train"],["clareview","ets"],["stadium","ets"],["victoria","australia"]],"members":["trax","victoria","clarendon","fruitvale","skytrain","sugarhouse","clareview","richmond_station","hayward","westbrook","rosslyn","stadium","court_house"],"related":["Arlington_County,_Virginia","Rosslyn_(WMATA_station)","Court_House_(WMATA_station)","Clarendon_(WMATA_station)","Washington_Metro","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Smart_growth","Retail","Pedestrian","Bus_stop","Parking","Mixed-use_development","Public_transport","Train_station","Metro_station","Tram_stop","Bus_stop","Pedestrian","New_town","World_War_II","Japan","Sweden","France","Land_reclamation","Netherlands","Exurban","Denmark","Bicycle","Transit-proximate_development","Urban_sprawl","Pedestrian_crossing","Parking","Portland,_Oregon","Montreal","San_Francisco","Vancouver","Guatemala_City","Álvaro_Arzú","Bus_rapid_transit","Transmetro","Curitiba","Brazil","San_Francisco_Bay_Area","San_Jose,_California","San_Francisco","Oakland,_California","Fremont,_California","Michael_S._Bernick","Robert_Cervero","Pleasant_Hill_/_Contra_Costa_Centre_(BART_station)","Fruitvale_(BART_station)","Hayward_(BART_station)","Richmond_Station_(California)","Salt_Lake_City_metropolitan_area","Utah_Transit_Authority","TRAX_(light_rail)","West_Valley_City,_Utah","Farmington,_Utah","Murray,_Utah","Provo,_Utah","Kaysville,_Utah","Sugarhouse_(Salt_Lake_City)","Downtown_Salt_Lake_City","Wasatch_Front","2002_Olympic_Winter_Games","SkyTrain_(Vancouver)","Burnaby","British_Columbia","Yonge–University–Spadina_line","Yonge_and_Eglinton","North_York_Centre","Empress_Walk","Condominium","Sheppard_line","Condominium","Bridgeland,_Calgary","Westbrook_(C-Train)","Suburb","Century_Park,_Edmonton","Edmonton_Light_Rail_Transit","Clareview_(ETS)","Stadium_(ETS)","Glenora,_Edmonton","Strathearn,_Edmonton","Hong_Kong","LOHAS_Park","Olympian_City","Tung_Chung","Melbourne","Victoria_(Australia)","Sustainability","Paris_Métro","Velib","Autolib","Randstad","Gentrification","Americas_Energy_and_Climate_Symposium","Auto-oriented_development","Principles_of_Intelligent_Urbanism","Smart_growth","Streetcar_suburb","Transit-proximate_development","Transit_village","Urban_consolidation","Value_capture"]}
