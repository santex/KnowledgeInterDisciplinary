Web\ndevelopment can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain\ntext to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses,\nand social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web\ndevelopment commonly refers, may include web design, web content development,\nclient liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network\nsecurity configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals,\n\"web development\" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web\nsites: writing markup and coding.\n\nFor larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of\nhundreds of people (web developers). Smaller organizations may only require a\nsingle permanent or contracting webmaster, or secondary assignment to related\njob positions such as a graphic designer and/or information systems technician.\nWeb development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than\nthe domain of a designated department.\n","linknr":300,"url":"Web_development","recorded":1362477548,"links":27,"instances":["software","programming_language","software","programming_language","software","software_bundle","software","web_server","programming_language","programming_language","software","programming_language","programming_language","programming_language","programming","web_framework","framework","database_server"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Web
