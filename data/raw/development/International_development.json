Hans Rosling] after 21 seconds is most used\nin a holistic and multi-disciplinary context of human development â the\ndevelopment of greater quality of life for humans. It therefore encompasses\nforeign aid, governance, healthcare, education, poverty reduction, gender\nequality, disaster preparedness, infrastructure, economics, human rights,\nenvironment and issues associated with\nthese. [http://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/research Oxford Department of International\nDevelopment] International development is different from simple\ndevelopment in that it is specifically composed of institutions and policies\nthat arose after the Second World War. These institutions focus on alleviating\npoverty and improving living conditions in previously colonised countries. (2009). Development. In D. Gregory, Dictionary of\nHuman Geography, 5th Edition (pp. 155-156). Wiley-Blackwell.\n\nInternational development is related to the concept of international aid, but is\ndistinct from, disaster relief and humanitarian aid. While these two forms of\ninternational support seek to alleviate some of the problems associated with a\nlack of development, they are most often short term fixes â they are not\nnecessarily long-term solutions. International development, on the other hand,\nseeks to implement long-term solutions to problems by helping developing\ncountries create the necessary capacity needed to provide such sustainable\nsolutions to their problems. A truly sustainable development project is one\nwhich will be able to carry on indefinitely with no further international\ninvolvement or support, whether it be financial or otherwise.\n\nInternational development projects may consist of a single, transformative\nproject to address a specific problem or a series of projects targeted at\nseveral aspects of society. Promoted projects are ones which involve problem\nsolving that reflects the unique culture, politics, geography, and economy of a\nregion. More recently, the focus in this field has been projects that aim\ntowards empowering women, building local economies, and caring for the\nenvironment. (2009).
