The scope\n of veterinary medicine is wide, covering all animal species, both domesticated\n and wild, with a wide range of conditions which can affect different species.\n\nVeterinary medicine is widely practiced, both with and without professional\nsupervision. Professional care is most often led by a veterinary physician (also\nknown as a vet, veterinary surgeon or veterinarian), but also by paraveterinary\nworkers such as veterinary nurses or technicians. This can be augmented by other\nparaprofessionals with specific specialisms such as animal physiotherapy or\ndentistry, and species relevant roles such as farriers.\n\nVeterinary science helps human health through the monitoring and control of\nzoonotic disease (infectious disease transmitted from non-human animals to\nhumans) and veterinary scientists often collaborate with epidemiologists.\n","linknr":447,"url":"Veterinary_medicine","recorded":1362505709,"links":66,"instances":["dog","animal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Health sciences","Veterinary medicine|*"],"headings":["History","Veterinary workers","See also","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Veterinary_Outreach_Hawaye_Kebele_Ethiopia.jpg/220px-Veterinary_Outreach_Hawaye_Kebele_Ethiopia.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/USArmyVetHospitalWWISurgeryPrep.jpg/220px-USArmyVetHospitalWWISurgeryPrep.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/US_and_South_African_Army_Vet_Technicians_Prepare_Dog_for_Spaying.jpg/220px-US_and_South_African_Army_Vet_Technicians_Prepare_Dog_for_Spaying.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Kitten_check_up_at_Guantanamo.jpg/220px-Kitten_check_up_at_Guantanamo.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["docking","dog"],["cropping","animal"]],"members":["docking","cropping"],"related":["Science","Animal","List_of_domesticated_animals","Wildlife","Veterinary_physician","Paraveterinary_workers","Physiotherapy","Dentistry","Farrier","Zoonosis","Infectious_disease","Epidemiology","Egypt","Vedas","Vedic_period","Shalihotra","Edicts_of_Ashoka","Asoka","Herbal_medicine","Farrier","Lord_Mayor_of_London","City_of_London","Carlo_Ruini","Lyon","Claude_Bourgelat","Veterinary_College_of_London","Granville_Penn","William_Penn","Iowa_Agricultural_College","Land_grant_college","Human_medicine","Paraveterinary_workers","Pet","Livestock","Zoological_medicine","Horse","Veterinary_surgery","Dermatology","Internal_medicine","Onychectomy","Docking_(dog)","Cropping_(animal)","Devocalization","Musculoskeletal","Osteopathy","Chiropractor","Physiotherapists","Farrier","One_Health","Federation_of_veterinarians_of_Europe","National_Office_of_Animal_Health","Veterinary_medicine_in_the_United_Kingdom","Veterinary_medicine_in_the_United_States"]}
