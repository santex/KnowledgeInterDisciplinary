{"cursor":"65002","size":14,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn psychology, philosophy, and their many subsets, 'emotion' is the generic term\nfor subjective, conscious experience that is characterized primarily by\npsychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states.\nEmotion is often associated and considered reciprocally influential with mood,\ntemperament, personality, disposition, and motivation, as well as influenced by\nhormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin,\noxytocin and cortisol. Emotion is often the driving force behind motivation,\npositive or negative. Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H.\nMcBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. ISBN 978-0-13-111529-3,\nChapter 6, p 121-142. The physiology of emotion is closely linked to\narousal of the nervous system with various states and strengths of arousal\nrelating, apparently, to particular emotions. Although those acting primarily on\nemotion may seem as if they are not thinking, cognition is an important aspect\nof emotion, particularly the interpretation of events. For example, the\nexperience of fear usually occurs in response to a threat. The cognition of\ndanger and subsequent arousal of the nervous system (e.g. rapid heartbeat and\nbreathing, sweating, muscle tension) is an integral component to the subsequent\ninterpretation and labeling of that arousal as an emotional state. Emotion is\nalso linked to behavioral tendency. Research on emotion has increased\nsignificantly over the past two decades with many fields contributing including\npsychology, neuroscience, medicine, history, sociology, and even computer\nscience. The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, neurobiology,\nexperience, and function of emotions have only fostered more intense research on\nthis topic. The current research that is being conducted about the concept of\nemotion involves the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion.\nIn addition PET scans and fMRI scans help study the affective processes in the\nbrain.
