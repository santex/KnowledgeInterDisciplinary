Total involvement with an object of interest\nis not an ordinary experience because of being aware of other objects, thus\necstasy is an example of an altered state of consciousness characterized by\ndiminished awareness of other objects or the total lack of the awareness of\nsurroundings and everything around the object. For instance, if one is\nconcentrating on a physical task, then any intellectual thoughts may cease. On\nthe other hand, making a spirit journey in an ecstatic trance involves the\ncessation of voluntary bodily movement.\n\nFor the duration of the ecstasy the ecstatic is out of touch with ordinary life\nand is capable neither of communication with other people nor of undertaking\nnormal actions. The experience can be brief in physical time, or it can go on\nfor hours. Subjective perception of time, space and/or self may strongly change\nor disappear during ecstasy. The word is also used to refer to any heightened\nstate of consciousness or intensely pleasant experience. It is also used more\nspecifically to denote states of awareness of non-ordinary mental spaces, which\nmay be perceived as spiritual (the latter type of ecstasy often takes the form\nof religious ecstasy).\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, ecstasy is a loss of self-control and\nsometimes a temporary loss of consciousness, which is often associated with\nreligious mysticism, sexual intercourse and the use of certain drugs.\n","linknr":383,"url":"Ecstasy_(emotion)","recorded":1362373730,"links":45,"instances":["philosophy","psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Emotions","Aesthetics","Positive mental attitude","Happiness"],"headings":["Types","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Jean_Benner%2C_L%27Extase_%28_Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_moderne_et_contemporain_de_Strasbourg_%29.JPG/220px-Jean_Benner%2C_L%27Extase_%28_Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_moderne_et_contemporain_de_Strasbourg_%29.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/90px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ecstasy","philosophy"],["flow","psychology"]],"members":["ecstasy","flow"],"related":["Strasbourg_Museum_of_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art","Altered_state_of_consciousness","Spirit","Religious_ecstasy","Meditation","Music","Dancing","Physical_exercise","Sexual_intercourse","Psychotropic_drug","Anthropology_of_religion","Culture","Psychosis","James_Leuba","Altered_state_of_consciousness","Ecstasy_(philosophy)","Entheogen","Flow_(psychology)","Mysticism","Poem_of_Ecstasy","Religious_ecstasy"]}
