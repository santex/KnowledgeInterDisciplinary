The story and emotional content of the piece â humor,\npathos, love, anger â are communicated through the words, music, movement\nand technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although\nmusical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it\nmay be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with\nthe dialogue, movement and other elements of the works. Since the early 20th\ncentury, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply,\n'musicals'.\n\nAlthough music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times,\nmodern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, culminating with\nthe works of Gilbert and Sullivan in Britain and those of Harrigan and Hart in\nAmerica. These were followed by the numerous Edwardian musical comedies and the\nmusical theatre works of American creators like George M. Cohan. The Princess\nTheatre musicals and other smart shows like [[Of Thee I Sing]] (1931) were\nartistic steps forward beyond revues and other frothy entertainments of the\nearly 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as [[Show Boat]] (1927)\nand [[Oklahoma!]] (1943). Some of the most famous and iconic musicals through\nthe decades that followed include [[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]] (1957), [[The\nFantasticks]] (1960), [[Hair (musical)|Hair]] (1967), [[A Chorus Line]] (1975),\n[[Les MisÃ©rables (musical)|Les MisÃ©rables]] (1985), [[The Phantom of the Opera\n(1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]] (1986), [[Rent (musical)|Rent]]\n(1994), [[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]] (2001) and [[Wicked\n(musical)|Wicked]] (2003).\n\nMusicals are performed all around the world. They may be presented in large\nvenues, such as big budget West End and Broadway theatre productions in London\nand New York, or in smaller fringe theatre, Off-Broadway or regional theatre\nproductions, on tour, or by amateur groups in schools, theatres and other\nperformance spaces. In addition to Britain and North America, there are\nvibrant musical theatre scenes in many countries in Europe, Latin America,\nAustralasia and Asia.\n","linknr":1377,"url":"Musical_theatre","recorded":1362477686,"links":84,"instances":["writer","song","composer","song","composer","songwriter","film","composer","theatre","band","performing_arts","lyricist","lyricist","theatre_writer","broadway","dramatist","song","band","composer","composer","film","group"],"pdf":["http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~foxplays/preview/PDF/Mini%20Musicals%20Preview.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071127051412/http://www.tuts.com/season07/wonderful_study.pdf","http://www.tuts.com/season07/wonderful_study.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20071127051412/http://www.tuts.com/season07/wonderful_study.pdf","http://www.solt.co.uk/downloads/pdfs/pressroom/SOLT_180108.pdf","http://www.solt.co.uk/downloads/pdfs/pressroom/SOLT_180108.pdf"],"categories":["Broadway
