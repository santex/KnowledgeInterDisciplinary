{"cursor":"1818","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Action' as a term in Western theatre practice refers to a principle from actor\ntraining first developed by Russian actor and theatre director Konstantin\nStanislavski in the first half of the 20th century at the Moscow Art Theatre. It\nforms part of his overall structure of systematized acting training, most\nfrequently called the System, which in its turn gave rise to Method Acting.\n\nIn his writings on theatre, Stanislavski states \"The basis of theatre is doing,\ndynamism. [...] In Latin, the corresponding word is actio, and the root of this\nsame word has passed into our vocabulary, \"action\", \"actor\", \"act\". So, drama is\nan action we can see being performed, and, when he comes on, the actor becomes\nan agent in that action\" and \"acting is action - mental and\nphysical.\" Jean Benedetti understands action in a Stanislavskian\ncontext more simply as \"What is done in order to fulfill a Task,\" a Task in its\nturn referring to \"What a character has to do, the problem he has to\nsolve.\" Action as a term in theatre practice derived from the\nStanislavski System therefore refers to that which a character undertakes in\norder to achieve a goal.\n","linknr":99,"url":"Action_(theatre)","recorded":1362677313,"links":11,"instances":["arts"],"pdf":[],"categories":["20th-century theatre"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","arts"]],"members":["character"],"related":["Theatre","Actor","Konstantin_Stanislavski","Moscow_Art_Theatre","Method_Acting","Character_(arts)"]}
