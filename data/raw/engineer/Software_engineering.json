The term software engineering first appeared in\nthe 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference and was meant to provoke thought\nregarding the perceived \"software crisis\" at the time. {{cite\nconference\n  | first = Naur last = Peter coauthors = Brian Randell title = Software\n  | Engineering: Report of a conference sponsored by the NATO Science Committee\n  | publisher = Scientific Affairs Division, NATO date = 7â11 October 1968\n  | location = Garmisch, Germany url =\n  | http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/nato1968.PDF\n  |format=PDF| doi =\n  | id = accessdate = 2008-12-26}}\n{{cite web\n| url = http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/NATOReports/index.html\n| title = The 1968/69 NATO Software Engineering Reports accessdate = 2008-10-11\n| | last = Randell | first = Brian | authorlink = Brian Randell\n|date = 10 August 2001\n| work = Brian Randell's University Homepage publisher = The School of the\n| Computer Sciences, Newcastle University quote = The idea for the first NATO\n| Software Engineering Conference, and in particular that of adopting the then\n| practically unknown term \"software engineering\" as its (deliberately\n| provocative) title, I believe came originally from Professor Fritz\n| Bauer.}} [[Software development]], a much used and more generic term,\n| does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm. The generally accepted\n| concepts of Software Engineering as an engineering discipline have been\n| specified in the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK).\n| The SWEBOK has become an internationally accepted standard ISO/IEC TR\n| 19759:2005. {{cite web url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalog-\n| ue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33897 title = ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005\n| accessdate = 2012-04-01}}\n\nFor those who wish to become recognized as professional software engineers, the\nIEEE offers two certifications ([[Certified Software Development Associate]] and\n[[Certified Software Development Professional]]). The IEEE certifications do not\nuse the term Engineer in their title for compatibility reasons. In some parts of\nthe US such as Texas, the use of the term Engineer is regulated only to those\nwho have a Professional Engineer license. Further, in the United States starting\nfrom 2013, the [[NCEES]] [[Professional Engineer]] licences are available also\nfor Software Engineers. {{cite web\n| url =
