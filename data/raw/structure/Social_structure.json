{"cursor":"17459","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Social structure' is a term used in the social sciences to refer to patterned\nsocial arrangements in society that are both emergent from and determinant of\nthe actions of the individuals. The usage of the term \"social structure\" has\nchanged over time and may reflect the various levels of analysis within\ndiffering sub-fields of sociology. On the macro scale, it can refer to the\nsystem of socioeconomic stratification (e.g., the class structure), social\ninstitutions, or, other patterned relations between large social groups. On the\nmeso scale, it can refer to the structure of social network ties between\nindividuals or organizations. On the micro scale, it can refer to the way norms\nshape the behavior of actors within the social system.\n\nThese meanings are not always kept separate. For example, recent scholarship by\nJohn Levi Martin has theorized that certain macro-scale structures are the\nemergent properties of micro-scale cultural institutions (this meaning of\n\"structure\" resembles that used by anthropologist Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss). Marxist\nsociology also has a history of mixing different meanings of social structure,\nthough it has done so by simply treating the cultural aspects of social\nstructure as epiphenomena of its economic ones.\n\nSince the 1930s, the term has been in general use in social science, Merton,\nRobert. 1938.
