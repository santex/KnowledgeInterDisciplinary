Most fan clubs are run by fans who devote considerable time\n and resources to supporting them. There are also \"official\" fan clubs that are\n run by someone associated with the person or organization the club is centered\n around. This is the case for many musicians, sports teams and more.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Fan_club","recorded":1362535150,"links":29,"instances":["person"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fan clubs|"],"headings":["Functions","Internet","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Hertha_uk_fan_club.png/100px-Hertha_uk_fan_club.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fan","person"]],"members":["fan"],"related":["History","Fan_(person)","Musician","Sport","Fundraising","Web_site","Musician","Bulletin_board_system","Concert"]}
