{"cursor":"4892","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" after fermentation.]]\n\n'Lees' refers to deposits of dead yeast or residual yeast and other particles\nthat precipitate, or are carried by the action of \"fining\", to the bottom of a\nvat of wine after fermentation and aging. The yeast deposits in beer brewing are\nknown as trub. However, yeast deposits from secondary fermentation of beer are\nreferred to as lees.\n\nNormally the wine is transferred to another container (racking), leaving this\nsediment behind. Some wines (notably Chardonnay, Champagne and Muscadet) are\nsometimes aged for a time on the lees (a process known as [[sur lie]]), leading\nto a distinctive yeasty aroma and taste. The lees may be stirred (bÃ¢tonage in\nFrench) in order to promote uptake of the lees flavour.\n\nThe lees are an important component in the making of Ripasso where the left-over\nlees from Amarone are used to impart more flavour and colour to partially aged\nValpolicella.\n\nReferences go as far back as the early translations of Jewish scriptures where\nthe phrase \"Wine on the lees\" is used in Isaiah 25:6 in the King James version\nof the Bible.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Lees_(fermentation)","recorded":1362675377,"links":20,"instances":["wine","wine","brewing","wine","wine","wine","wine"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fermentation (food)","Oenology","Yeasts"],"headings":["Sur lie","Light lees protocol","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Merlot_wine_lees_after_fermentation.JPG/200px-Merlot_wine_lees_after_fermentation.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg/40px-Nuvola_kdict_glass.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fining","wine"],["fermentation","wine"],["aging","wine"],["trub","brewing"],["champagne","wine"],["tannin","wine"],["champagne","wine"],["autolysis","wine"]],"members":["autolysis","champagne","trub","aging","fining","tannin","fermentation"],"related":["Yeast","Fining_(wine)","Vat","Wine","Fermentation_(wine)","Aging_(wine)","Beer","Trub_(brewing)","Bottle_conditioning","Racking","Chardonnay","Champagne_(wine)","Muscadet","Ripasso","Amarone","Valpolicella","Judaism","Book_of_Isaiah","King_James_version","Bible","French_language","Racking","Chardonnay","Montrachet","Tannin_(wine)","Wine_color","Muscadet","Champagne_(wine)","Quebec","Canada","Unibroue","Racking","Autolysis_(wine)","Polysaccharides"]}
