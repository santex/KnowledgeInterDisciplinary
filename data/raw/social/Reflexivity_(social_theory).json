A\nreflexive relationship is bidirectional with both the cause and the effect\naffecting one another in a situation that does not render both functions causes\nand effects. In sociology, reflexivity therefore comes to mean an act of self-\nreference where examination or action \"bends back on\", refers to, and affects\nthe entity instigating the action or examination.\n\nTo this extent it commonly refers to the capacity of an agent to recognize\nforces of socialization and alter their place in the social structure. A low\nlevel of reflexivity would result in an individual shaped largely by their\nenvironment (or 'society'). A high level of social reflexivity would be defined\nby an individual shaping their own norms, tastes, politics, desires, and so on.\nThis is similar to the notion of autonomy. (See also: structure and agency,\nsocial mobility)\n\nIn Economics reflexivity refers to the self-reinforcing effect of market\nsentiment, whereby rising prices attract buyers whose actions drive prices\nhigher still until the process becomes unsustainable and the same process\noperates in reverse leading to a catastrophic collapse in prices.\n\nIt is an instance of a feedback loop.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Reflexivity_(social_theory)","recorded":1362485208,"links":20,"instances":["sociology","historian"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Sociological terminology","Sociological theories","Sociology index"],"headings":["Overview","History","In economics","In anthropology","Reflexivity and the status of the social sciences","See also","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg/180px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg/10px-Moai_Easter_Island_InvMH-35-61-1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/SNA_segment.png/180px-SNA_segment.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["agency","sociology"],["james_clifford","historian"]],"members":["agency","james_clifford"],"related":["Sociology","Agency_(sociology)","Socialization","Social_structure","Autonomy","Structure_and_agency","Social_mobility","Economics","Feedback","Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge","Observer_effect","Sociology_of_science","Strong_programme","Epistemology","Self-awareness","Social_behavior","Social_relationship","Thomas_theorem","Robert_K._Merton","Self-fulfilling_prophecy","Karl_Popper","Herbert_A._Simon","Lucas_critique","Sociology_of_Scientific_Knowledge","Structure_and_agency","Anthony_Giddens","Structuration_theory","Pierre_Bourdieu","Genetic_structuralism","Reflexive_modernity","Michel_Foucault","The_Order_of_Things","Episteme","Immanuel_Kant","Discourse","George_Soros","Karl_Popper","George_Soros","Procyclical","Michel_Foucault","James_Clifford_(historian)","George_Marcus","Feminist_anthropology","Subaltern_studies","Postmodernism","Self-reference","Roman_Jakobson","Deixis","Mikhail_Bakhtin","Gregory_Bateson","Meta-messages","Clifford_Geertz","Authenticity","Metaculture","Experimenter_effect","Goodhart's_law","Hawthorne_effect","Observer_effect","Lucas_critique","Self_fulfilling_prophecy","George_Soros","Thomas_theorem","Pierre_Bourdieu"]}
