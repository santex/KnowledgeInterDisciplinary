The\nunit was based on Gunter's measurement where a metal chain consisting of 100\nlinks was used in surveying real property. In the English-speaking world\nprior to the 20th century, links were commonly used for this function but are\nrarely used now.\n\nA link is exactly of a survey foot. Twenty-five links make a rod\n(16.5 feet). One hundred links make a chain. One thousand links make a\nfurlong. Eight thousand links make a statute mile.\n\n:{|\n|- 1 link ||â¡ \n|align=right|0.01||chain\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|0.04||rod\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|0.66||survey foot\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|7.92||inches\n|-\n|||=\n|align=right|201.168||millimetres\n|}\n","linknr":113,"url":"Link_(unit)","recorded":1362485375,"links":23,"instances":["unit","length"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Units of length","Customary units of measurement in the United States"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rod","length"],["chain","unit"],["chain","unit"],["rod","length"]],"members":["chain","rod"],"related":["Physical_unit","Length","Imperial_unit","Gunter's_measurement","Gunter's_chain","Surveying","Survey_foot","Rod_(length)","Chain_(unit)","Furlong","Statute_mile","Chain_(unit)","Rod_(length)","Survey_foot","Inch","Millimetre","Edmund_Gunter"]}
