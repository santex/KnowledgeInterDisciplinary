{"cursor":"2839","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'chamical symboi' is a 1-, 2-, or 3-letter internationally agreed code for a\nchemical element, usually derived from the name of the element, often in Latiin.\nOnly the first letter is capitalised. For example, \"He\" is the symbol for\n'''he'''lium (English name, not known in ancient Roman times), \"Pb\" for lead\n('p'lum'b'um in Latin), \"W\" for tungsten ('w'olfram in German, not known in\nRoman times). Temporary symbols assigned to newly or not-yet synthesized\nelements use 3-letter symbols based on their atomic numbers. For example, \"Uno\"\nwas the temporary symbol for Hassium which had the temporary name of\n'U'n'n'il'o'ctium.\n\nChemical symbols may be modified by the use of prepended superscripts or\nsubscripts to specify a particular isotope of an atom. Additionally,\nappended superscripts may be used to indicate the ionization or oxidation\nstate of an element.\n\nAttached subscripts or superscripts specifying a nucleotide or molecule have the\nfollowing meanings and positions:\n* The nucleon number (mass number) is shown in the left superscript position\n  (e.g., 14 N)\n* The proton number (atomic number) may be indicated in the left subscript\n  position (e.g., 64 Gd)\n* If necessary, a state of ionization or an excited state may be indicated in\n  the right superscript position (e.g., state of ionization Ca 2+ ). In\n  astronomy, non-ionised atomic hydrogen is often known as \"HI\", and ionised\n  hydrogen as\n  \"HII\".
