{"cursor":"2532","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In machine learning and pattern recognition, a 'feature' is an individual\nmeasurable heuristic property of a phenomenon being observed. Choosing\ndiscriminating and independent features is key to any pattern recognition\nalgorithm being successful in classification. Features are usually numeric, but\nstructural features such as strings and graphs are used in syntactic pattern\nrecognition.\n\nThe set of features of a given data instance is often grouped into a feature\nvector. The reason for doing this is that the vector can be treated\nmathematically. For example, many algorithms compute a score for classifying an\ninstance into a particular category by linearly combining a feature vector with\na vector of weights, using a linear predictor function.\n\nThe concept of \"feature\" is essentially the same as the concept of explanatory\nvariable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Features_(pattern_recognition)","recorded":1362554569,"links":17,"instances":["electronic","computer_science","machine_learning","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Machine learning"],"headings":["Classification","Examples","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["classification","machine_learning"],["string","computer_science"],["graph","mathematics"],["spam","electronic"]],"members":["spam","string","classification","graph"],"related":["Machine_learning","Pattern_recognition","Heuristic","Classification_(machine_learning)","String_(computer_science)","Graph_(mathematics)","Syntactic_pattern_recognition","Feature_vector","Linear_predictor_function","Explanatory_variable","Statistics","Linear_regression","K-nearest_neighbor_algorithm","Neural_networks","Statistical_classification","Bayesian_inference","Character_recognition","Speech_recognition","Phonemes","Spam_(electronic)","Feature_extraction","Covariate","Hashing_trick"]}
