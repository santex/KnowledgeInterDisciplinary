{"cursor":"2262","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nA 'line echo wave pattern' or 'LEWP' (pronounced \"loop\" or spelled out) is the\nradar signature associated with a multiple-bow serial derecho.\n\nA LEWP, according to the NWAS, is defined as \"a squall line that has developed\ninto a wave-like pattern due to acceleration at one end of the line and\ndeceleration along the portion immediately adjacent.\"\n\nA LEWP can be compared to the bow echo, which usually indicates a powerful\nconvective windstorm. Areas hit by the apices of bows often see the worst\nweather, with the highest winds and very heavy rain. However, if the sides of\nthe bows reach enough of an orientation parallel to the derecho's movement, a\nvery long-duration heavy rain event can result, leading to flash flooding. A\nserial derecho can be in the form of a LEWP or a single, very large bow\necho.\n\nLEWP events can produce strong, damaging winds and tornadoes.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Line_echo_wave_pattern","recorded":1362564975,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Radar meteorology","Severe weather and convection"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d7/Illinois-LEWP.jpg/220px-Illinois-LEWP.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG/40px-Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Derecho","Bow_echo","Storm_train","Flash_flood","Bow_echo"]}
