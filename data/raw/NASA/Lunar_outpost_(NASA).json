Bush era Vision for Space\nExploration, which has been replaced with President Barack Obama's space\npolicy. The outpost would have been an inhabited\nfacility on the surface of the Moon. At the time it was proposed, NASA was to\nconstruct the outpost over the five years between 2019 and 2024. The United\nStates Congress directed that the U.S. portion, \"shall be designated the Neil A.\nArmstrong Lunar Outpost\".\n\nOn December 4, 2006, NASA announced the conclusion of its Global Exploration\nStrategy and Lunar Architecture Study. The Lunar Architecture Study's\npurpose was to \"define a series of lunar missions constituting NASA's Lunar\ncampaign to fulfill the Lunar Exploration elements\" of the Vision for Space\nExploration. What resulted was a basic plan for a lunar\noutpost near one of the poles of the Moon, which would permanently house\nastronauts in six-month shifts. These studies were made before the discovery of\nwater ice (5.6 Â± 2.9% by mass) in a polar crater, {{Cite journal |author=Colaprete, A.; Schultz, P.;\nHeldmann, J.; Wooden, D.; Shirley, M.; Ennico, K.; Hermalyn, B.; Marshall, W;\nRicco, A.; Elphic, R.
