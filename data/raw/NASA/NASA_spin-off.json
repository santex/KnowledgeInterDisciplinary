{"cursor":"31788","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'NASA spin-off technologies' are spin-offs of technology that have been\ncommercialized through NASA funding, research, licensing, facilities, or\nassistance. NASA also publishes an annual journal titled Spinoff which features\nproducts whose development can be linked to NASA, for example through NASA\nfunding (such as SBIR or STTR awards), licensing (from NASA patents), facilities\n(such as product testing at NASA facilities), NASA assistance (such as former\nNASA scientists helping to design a product), or NASA research. A lot of the\ntechnology that came from space spin-off is an important part of today's world,\nfor example the ultra sound is an important part of many births. More examples\ndown below.\n\nIn 1957, notable science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein was asked to appear\nbefore a joint committee of the House and Senate after recovering from one of\nthe earliest known carotid bypass operations to correct a blocked artery that\nwas causing transient ischemic attacks; in his testimony, reprinted in the book\nExpanded Universe, he characterized the technology that made the surgery\npossible as merely one of a long list of spinoff technologies from space\ndevelopment.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the NASA Innovative Partnerships Program has connected\nNASA resources to private industry, referring to the commercial products as spin-\noffs. Well-known products that NASA claims as spin-offs include memory foam\n(originally named temper foam), freeze-dried food, firefighting equipment,\nemergency \"space blankets\", Dustbusters, cochlear implants, and now Speedo's LZR\nRacer swimsuits. NASA claims that there are over 1650 other spin-offs in the\nfields of computer technology, environment and agriculture, health and medicine,\npublic safety, transportation, recreation, and industrial productivity. Contrary\nto common belief, NASA did not invent Tang, Velcro, or Teflon.\n\nIn 2008, NASA announced an interactive Web feature, NASA @ Home and City, which\nuses Flash animation to show some examples of everyday products claimed to be\nspin-offs.\n\nBelow are 27 abstracts of products claimed to be NASA spin-offs.\n","linknr":574,"url":"NASA_spin-off","recorded":1362268039,"links":51,"instances":["tv_series","drink","heinlein"],"pdf":["http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1991.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1991.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1985.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1985.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1976.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1976.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1978.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1978.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1981.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1981.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1982.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1982.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1977.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1977.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1979.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1979.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1988.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1988.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1980.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1980.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1994.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1994.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1995.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1995.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1986.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1986.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1990.pdf","http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/back_issues_archives/1990.pdf","http://spinoff.nasa.gov/pdf/AIAA%202011%20Quantifying%20Spinoff%20Benefits.pdf"],"categories":["NASA
