On this album, the band opted for more\nintensive use of keyboards and industrial sounds, drifting from their black\nmetal roots and progressing in a different direction. Lyrically the band\nabandoned satanic themes and veered more towards the occult and the cosmic.\n\nWhile it differs from its predecessors, Passage can be credited for thrusting\nSamael from the underground scene and giving the band a much larger\ninternational audience.\n\nThe album was originally recorded with a 17 song track list but was later cut\ndown to 11. The remaining songs can be found on the album [[Exodus (Samael\nalbum)|Exodus]]. A second edition was later offered containing 10 classical\npiano compositions from the album on a second disk.\n\nIn 2007, a remastered, re-packaged, special edition was released containing the\nalbum's original 17 song track list.\n\nOver a decade after its original release, Passage is still considered by many to\nbe a pillar in the black/industrial metal genre.\n\nA video for \"Jupiterian Vibe\" received regular airplay on MTV's\n[[Headbangers Ball]].\n\nThe album was produced by Waldemar Sorychta, who would go on to work with bands\nsuch as Lacuna Coil.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Passage_(Samael_album)","recorded":1362674767,"links":23,"instances":["band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Samael albums","1996 albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Remastered 2007 Special Edition Tracks","Personnel","Production","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/68/Samael_passage.jpg/220px-Samael_passage.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg/32px-Gnome-dev-cdrom-audio.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["samael","band"],["samael","band"]],"members":["samael"],"related":["Samael_(band)","Symphonic_black_metal","Industrial_metal","Century_Media_Records","Waldemar_Sorychta","Allmusic","Heavy_metal_music","Samael_(band)","Satanism","Industrial_metal","MTV","Waldemar_Sorychta","Lacuna_Coil"]}
