{"cursor":"3146","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'']] 'Toxalbumins' are toxic plant proteins that disable ribosomes and thereby\ninhibit protein synthesis, producing severe cytotoxic effects in multiple organ\nsystems. They are dimers held together by a disulfide bond and comprise a lectin\n(carbohydrate-binding protein) part which binds to the cell membrane and enables\nthe toxin part to gain access to the cell contents. Toxalbumins are similar in\nstructure to the toxins found in cholera, tetanus, diphtheria and\nbotulinum; http://www.jstor.org/pss/20243302 and their physiological\nand toxic properties are similar to those of viperine snake\nvenom. http://www.planetayurveda.com/abrus_precatorius.htm\n\nToxalbumins notably are present in the plant families Leguminosae and\nEuphorbiaceae, occurring for instance in [[Robinia pseudoacacia]], [[Abrus\nprecatorius]], [[Jatropha curcas]], [[Croton gratissimus]] and [[Ricinus\ncommunis]]. Typical toxalbumins are abrin and ricin. http://www.drugsandpoisons.com/2008/01/lectins-peas-and-beans-gone-\nbad.html http://books.google.co.za/books?id=WuA4LsWXXWEC&pg=PA1345&lp-\ng=PA1345&dq=toxalbumin&source=bl&ots=iiJz7L3ADe&sig=t7l6nHitMpLmjffHXA0VTTISpEY-\n&hl=en&ei=QRclTIfCIdq5jAf5hoGBAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB-\nYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=toxalbumin&f=false Ingestion of seed containing\ntoxalbumins is not necessarily fatal as the hard seed coat will withstand\ndigestion, unless the seed has been pierced, as would happen in the making of\nnecklaces, prayer beads or bracelets, and even then the toxalbumin is likely to\nbe digested and thereby rendered harmless. Toxalbumins injected intravenously or\nsubcutaneously or inhaled in powdered form, though, are highly toxic. A latent\nperiod of hours to days may follow with no sensible signs of distress, after\nwhich symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea will appear, followed by\ndelirium, seizures, coma, and death. Seen from an evolutionary viewpoint,\ntoxalbumins developed as a deterrent to consumption of seeds.
