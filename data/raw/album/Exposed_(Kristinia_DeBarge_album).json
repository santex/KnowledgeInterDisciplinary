It was released in the US on July 28, 2009, and later\nelsewhere in August 2009 by label imprint Sodapop Records in distribution with\nIsland Records. The album debuted at number 23 on the US Billboard 200 with\n16,539 copies sold the first week. DeBarge began recording the album in 2008,\nand had been writing the album since 2006. The album features production and\nwriting from the likes of Babyface and OneRepublic\nfrontman Ryan Tedder amongst others.\n\nThe album spawned three different singles. The first of these singles, titled\n\"Goodbye\" has become DeBarge's biggest hit to date. The song reached the Top 20\nin the Hot 100, Canada, as well as the Australian Hitseekers Chart. It also\ncharted fairly well in countries such as Sweden. The second single was\n\"Sabotage\", which was released on August 18, 2009. Originally, the song was to\nbe released along with \"Future Love\", however, those plans were scrapped, and\n\"Sabotage\" became the stand-alone second single. Despite the success of her\nprevious single, \"Sabotage\" failed to chart on any chart worldwide. The third\nsingle, \"Future Love\" (featuring rapper Pitbull), was released on November 10,\n2009. The single became her second consecutive single to miss out on the\n''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart, however, it did peak at number 25 on the\nBubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart.\n\nExposed received generally positive reviews from music critics, based on an\naggregate score of 69/100 from Metacritic. [http://apps.metacritic.com/music/artists/debargekristinia/exposed\nExposed (2009): Reviews]. Metacritic. Retrieved on 2009-11-03. The album\nreceived positive reviews from major critical websites, such as [[Blues &\nSoul]], ''People'' Magazine, and AllMusic. On December 15, 2009, a deluxe\nedition of the album was released only on iTunes, in an attempt to boost album\nsales. The deluxe edition features two remixes of \"Goodbye\" and \"Sabotage\", as\nwell as the music video for the two songs. However, the deluxe edition failed to\nraise album sales, selling only 1,000 copies in its first week.\n","linknr":475,"url":"Exposed_(Kristinia_DeBarge_album)","recorded":1362665577,"links":38,"instances":["song","magazine","production_team","rapper","love","beyoncé_knowles_song","kristinia_debarge_song","musician","song"],"pdf":["http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20090805-0000/Issue1014.pdf","http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20090805-0000/Issue1014.pdf"],"categories":["2009 debut albums","Albums produced by Ryan Tedder","Island Records albums","Kristinia DeBarge albums"],"headings":["Background","Composition","Reception","Promotion","Singles","Track listing","Personnel","Chart performance","Release history","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Kristina_debarge_-_exposed_cover.jpg/220px-Kristina_debarge_-_exposed_cover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["the_jam","production_team"],["babyface","musician"],["goodbye","kristinia_debarge_song"],["goodbye","kristinia_debarge_song"],["pitbull","rapper"],["people","magazine"],["halo","beyoncé_knowles_song"],["battlefield","song"],["reflection","song"],["romance","love"],["goodbye","kristinia_debarge_song"],["goodbye","kristinia_debarge_song"],["goodbye","kristinia_debarge_song"],["goodbye","kristinia_debarge_song"]],"members":["battlefield","people","the_jam","pitbull","romance","halo","goodbye","babyface","reflection"],"related":["Kristinia_DeBarge","Pop_music","Contemporary_R&B","Island_Def_Jam","L._A._Reid","Ryan_Tedder","The_Jam_(production_team)","Babyface_(musician)","Goodbye_(Kristinia_DeBarge_song)","Future_Love","Contemporary_R&B","Kristinia_DeBarge","Island_Records","Kenneth_\"Babyface\"_Edmonds","OneRepublic","Ryan_Tedder","Goodbye_(Kristinia_DeBarge_song)","United_States","Sweden","Future_Love","Pitbull_(rapper)","Billboard_Hot_100","Bubbling_Under_Hot_100","Metacritic","Metacritic","People_(magazine)","AllMusic","ITunes_Store","Ryan_Tedder","Leona_Lewis","Bleeding_Love","Beyoncé_Knowles","Halo_(Beyoncé_Knowles_song)","Jordin_Sparks","Battlefield_(song)","Varsity_Fanclub","Kenneth_Edmonds","Reflection_(song)","R&B","Romance_(love)","Future_Love","Goodbye_(Kristinia_DeBarge_song)","Cry_Me_a_River","Justin_Timberlake","AllMusic","AllMusic","Digital_Spy","Billboard_200","Digital_Albums","Mexico","Goodbye_(Kristinia_DeBarge_song)","Future_Love","Jingle_Ball","Britney_Spears","Goodbye_(Kristinia_DeBarge_song)","Hot_100","Hot_Dance_Club_Play","Sweden","Canadian_Hot_100","Kristinia_DeBarge","Future_Love","Bubbling_Under_Hot_100","Future_Love","Evan_\"Kidd\"_Bogart","Ryan_Tedder","Goodbye_(Kristinia_DeBarge_song)","Tynisha_Keli","Kenneth_Edmonds","Allmusic","Billboard_200","Top_Digital_Albums","Interscope_Records","Universal_Music_Group"]}
