Upon its release, the\n  album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as [[Rock Hard\n  (magazine)|Rock Hard]], [[Kerrang!]] and [[Metal Forces]]. Barcinski & Gomes 1999, pages 99 & 103. Arise is\n  considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the\n  music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous\n  album, [[Beneath the Remains]], it was clear that the Sepultura sound was\n  acquiring an experimental edge.\n\nThe album presented their first incursions with industrial music, hardcore punk\nand Latin percussion. Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page\n89. Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 90. The tour\n(1990â1992) that supported the album was the group's longest at that time,\ntotalling 220 shows in 39 different countries. During\nthis trek, the album went gold in Indonesiaâthe band's first music industry\ncertification. Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 109. By\nthe tour's end, Arise had achieved platinum sales worldwide. |title= ((( Sepultura > Biography )))|author= Rivadavia,\nEduardo|publisher= allmusic.com|accessdate= 2008-06-02}}\n","linknr":452,"url":"Arise_(Sepultura_album)","recorded":1362689091,"links":40,"instances":["music","musician","band","producer","band","music","song","recorded_music","band","magazine","song","band","producer","regnum_irae"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Albums produced by Scott Burns","Roadrunner Records albums","Sepultura albums","1991 albums"],"headings":["Production","Musical style","Touring and promotion","Reception","Track listing","Chart performance","Credits","Bibliography","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/15px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Sepultura_-_Arise_1991.jpg/220px-Sepultura_-_Arise_1991.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Star_half.svg/11px-Star_half.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["scott_burns","producer"],["arise","song"],["under_siege","regnum_irae"],["scott_burns","producer"],["groove","music"],["ministry","band"],["sampling","music"],["obituary","band"],["obituary","band"],["heathen","band"],["helmet","band"],["orgasmatron","song"],["q","magazine"],["arise","song"],["under_siege","regnum_irae"],["orgasmatron","song"],["phil_campbell","musician"],["scott_burns","producer"],["andy_wallace","producer"],["audio_mixing","recorded_music"]],"members":["groove","phil_campbell","helmet","scott_burns","heathen","sampling","orgasmatron","audio_mixing","obituary","q","arise","ministry","andy_wallace","under_siege"],"related":["Sepultura","Morrisound_Recording","Tampa,_Florida","United_States","Thrash_metal","Death_metal","Roadrunner_Records","Sepultura","Scott_Burns_(producer)","Arise_(song)","Dead_Embryonic_Cells","Under_Siege_(Regnum_Irae)","Heavy_metal_music","Sepultura","Roadrunner_Records","Heavy_metal_music","Death_metal","Thrash_metal","Industrial_music","Hardcore_punk","Latin_percussion","Indonesia","Music_recording_sales_certification","Florida","Scott_Burns_(producer)","Record_producer","Audio_engineering","Morrisound_Recording","$","Drum_kit","Drum_set_tuning","Microphone_practice","Andreas_Kisser","LP_album","Igor_Cavalera","Groove_(music)","Heavy_metal_music","Einstürzende_Neubauten","The_Young_Gods","Ministry_(band)","Industrial_music","Sampling_(music)","Sound_effects","Extreme_metal","Obituary_(band)","Sadus","Obituary_(band)","Roadrunner_Records","New_York_City","NY","Brazil","Rock_in_Rio","São_Paulo","Estádio_do_Pacaembu","Military_police","Ramones","Heavy_metal_subculture","Skinheads","Rock_music","Sacred_Reich","Heathen_(band)","United_Kingdom","Pop_music","Weekly_newspaper","Barcelona","Grindcore","Napalm_Death","New_York_City","Sick_of_It_All","Germany","NWOBHM","Florida","Death_metal","Morbid_Angel","Rock_music","Black_Sabbath","Ozzy_Osbourne","Industrial_metal","Noise_rock","Helmet_(band)","Remastered","Music_critic","Bonus_tracks","Cover_version","Motörhead","Orgasmatron_(song)","Photo_shoot","AllMusic","Slayer","Metallica","Billboard_magazine","Music_recording_sales_certification","Music_recording_sales_certification","Indonesia","Q_(magazine)","Urinal","Book_of_Revelation","AllMusic","Sepultura","Arise_(song)","Max_Cavalera","Dead_Embryonic_Cells","Andreas_Kisser","Under_Siege_(Regnum_Irae)","Orgasmatron_(song)","Motörhead","Lemmy","Michael_Burston","Pete_Gill","Phil_Campbell_(musician)","Billboard_magazine","Sepultura","Record_producer","Max_Cavalera","Singing","Rhythm_guitar","Andreas_Kisser","Lead_guitar","Paulo_Jr.","Bass_guitar","Igor_Cavalera","Drum_kit","Percussion_instrument","Scott_Burns_(producer)","Audio_engineering","Andy_Wallace_(producer)","Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)","Audio_mastering","Synthesizer","Michael_Whelan"]}
