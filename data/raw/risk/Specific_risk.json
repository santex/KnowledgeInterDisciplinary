This is sometimes referred to as \"unsystematic risk\".

Determination of the extent\nof exposure to individual risks is made using models such as Treynor-Black in\nwhich the optimal share of a security is inversely proportional to the square of\nits specific risk.\n\nAn example would be news that is specific to either one stock or a group of\ncompanies, such as the loss of a patent or a major natural disaster affecting\nthe company's operation.\n\nUnlike systematic risk or market risk, specific risk can be diversified away.In\nfact, most unsystematic risk is removed by holding a portfolio of about twenty-\nfive to thirty securities.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Specific_risk","recorded":1362375062,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Financial risk"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/ThreeCoins.svg/40px-ThreeCoins.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Finance","Risk","Unsystematic_risk","Treynor-Black_model","Stock","Systematic_risk","Market_risk"]}
