ValDocs, an even earlier integrated suite, actually\ncomparable to the original Macintosh of 1984 and Apple Lisa of 1982 was produced\nby Epson, a complete integrated work station based on the previous Zilog Z80\nprocessor and CP/M operating system with GUI and \"WYSIWYG\" typography on the\nmonitor and printing. Framework offered all this however in the first all-in-one\npackage to run on any PC platform. It was preceded by a few months by its close\nrival Lotus Symphony. Unlike other integrated products Framework was not created\nas \"plug-in\" modules with similar look and feel but as a single windowing\nworkspace representing a desktop metaphor that could manage and outline \"Frames\"\nsharing a common underlying format. The initial release included about a dozen\nor so frame types (identified by a FRED function, @frametype). Frame types\nincluded containers which could be filled up with other frames, empty frames\nwhich could become other type of frames based on user input, formulas embedded\nin them or program output targeting them, word processor frames, flat-database\nframes and spreadsheet as well as graphic frames. Later versions included a\nframe type that can hold compiled executable code and the current version\ninclude an external type handled by separate applications running on the host\noperating system.\n\nFramework built-in interpreter, the FRED (Frame Editor) computer language, was\nbased on Lisp and included an Eval function. It applied to all text and frame\ntype across the product.\n\nFramework could be considered a predecessor to the present GUI window metaphor\nas well as integrated interpreters. The spreadsheet program was superior in its\nday, offering true 3D capability, where spreadsheets could form outline which\ncan be \"opened\" to reveal a separate spreadsheet as well as other frame typesâa\nfeat of sheer convenient function never again seen and further enhanced in much\nlater versions.\n\nRobert Carr and Marty Mazner founded Forefront Corporation to develop Framework\nin 1983. In July of that year, they approached Ashton-Tate to provide the\ncapital and to later market the product. Together with a team of six other\nindividuals, Carr and company released the original Framework. The product\nproved successful enough that in 1985, Ashton-Tate bought Forefront, a year\nsooner than planned.\n\nThe original team, now working for Ashton-Tate, continued to enhance the\nproduct producing 'Framework II' (1985), 'Framework III' (1988-\n1989) Hergert, Douglas & Kamin, Jonathan, \"Mastering Framework III\", Sybex\n1989, ISBN 0-89588-513-1. and finally in 1991, the last Ashton-Tate's\nversion, 'Framework IV'. Beginning with Framework II, the company also produced\n'Framework II Runtime' and 'Framework II Developer's Toolkit'. These products\nallowed application developers to create business applications using the built-\nin FRED programming language.\n\nAshton-Tate however did not aggressively market Framework compared to its\nmainstream '[[dBase|dBASE]]' product, and it failed to gain more than a fraction\nof the market share needed to become a workplace standard. Lotus 1-2-3 was able\nto successfully capture most of the spreadsheet market and after a number of\nsetbacks regarding Ashton-Tate's flag product, '[[dBase|dBASE]]', Borland bought\nAshton-Tate and later sold Framework to Selections & Functions, Inc, who is\nstill actively maintaining it. Present versions include the FrameworkPascal\ncompiler which extend Framework with Windows API interface.\n\nFramework works on most versions of Microsoft Windows. Framework 7 was the last\nversion which can be run on Windows 95/98/ME or on DOS. Framework 8 and 9 only\nrun on Windows XP.\n\nBeginning with Framework V (Framework 5) Selections and Functions gradually\nbegan to introduce new features to keep the office suite up-to-date. For\nexample, Framework VII (Framework 7) introduced long file names, the Euro symbol\nand the ability to display pictures in Framework. Framework VIII (Framework 8)\nintroduced the ability to display JPEG and .BMP files and to load such files\ninto Framework databases. Of particular importance, all of the Selections and\nFunctions' versions of Framework added the ability to share \"cut and paste\"\n(memory buffer data) between Windows and Framework.
