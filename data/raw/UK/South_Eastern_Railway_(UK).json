The company was formed to construct a route from London to\nDover. Branch lines were later opened to Tunbridge Wells, Hastings, Canterbury\nand other places in Kent. The SER absorbed or leased other railways, some older\nthan itself, including the London and Greenwich Railway and the Canterbury and\nWhitstable Railway. Most of the company's routes were in Kent, eastern Sussex\nand the London suburbs, with a long cross-country route from in Surrey to\nReading, Berkshire.\n\nMuch of the company's early history saw attempts at expansion and feuding with\nits neighbours; the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in the west\nand the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) to the north-east. However, in\n1899 the SER agreed with the LCDR to share operation of the two railways, work\nthem as a single system (marketed as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway) and\npool receipts: but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained\nseparate companies until becoming constituents of the Southern Railway on 1\nJanuary 1923.\n","linknr":993,"url":"South_Eastern_Railway_(UK)","recorded":1363389363,"links":["/w/index.php?title=South_Eastern_Railway,_UK&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=South_Eastern_Railway,_UK&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/South_Eastern_Railway,_UK","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=South_Eastern_Railway_(UK)&redirect=no","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/South_Eastern_and_Chatham_Railway","/wiki/South_Eastern_Railway_(India)","/wiki/Train_operating_company","/wiki/Southeastern_(train_operating_company)","/wiki/File:South_eastern_railway_crest.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/South_eastern_railway_crest.jpg","/wiki/File:South_eastern_railway_crest.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Offices_of_the_South_Eastern_Railway_in_London_-_Redvers.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Offices_of_the_South_Eastern_Railway_in_London_-_Redvers.jpg/220px-Offices_of_the_South_Eastern_Railway_in_London_-_Redvers.jpg","/wiki/File:Offices_of_the_South_Eastern_Railway_in_London_-_Redvers.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Tooley_Street","/wiki/London","/wiki/London_Bridge_station","/wiki/File:S_england_railways_1840.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/S_england_railways_1840.jpg/220px-S_england_railways_1840.jpg","/wiki/File:S_england_railways_1840.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/File:Kent_Railways.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Kent_Railways.svg/220px-Kent_Railways.svg.png","/wiki/File:Kent_Railways.svg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/England","/wiki/London","/wiki/Dover","/wiki/Tunbridge_Wells","/wiki/Hastings","/wiki/Canterbury","/wiki/London_and_Greenwich_Railway","/wiki/Canterbury_and_Whitstable_Railway","/wiki/Kent","/wiki/Sussex","/wiki/Redhill_railway_station","/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire","/wiki/London_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway","/wiki/London,_Chatham_and_Dover_Railway","/wiki/South_Eastern_and_Chatham_Railway","/wiki/Southern_Railway_(Great_Britain)","#Origins_of_the_company","#Choice_of_route_from_London_to_Dover","#Construction_of_the_Main_Line","#Folkestone_and_Dover_Harbours","#Bricklayers.27_Arms_Terminus","#Secondary_Main_lines_and_Branch_lines","#Canterbury_.26_Whitstable_Railway","#Medway_Valley_Line","#Greenwich_Line","#Tunbridge_Wells_and_Hastings_Line","#Ramsgate.2C_Margate_and_Deal_Lines","#Gravesend_and_Strood_Lines_.28North_Kent.29","#Early_Management_of_the_Company_1843-1855","#Reading_Guildford_and_Reigate_Railway","#Early_relations_with_the_London_Brighton_and_South_Coast_Railway","#Closing_the_Capital_Account","#Factionalism_and_bad_management_1854-1866","#East_Kent_and_London_Chatham_.26_Dover_Railways","#Continued_Bad_Relations_with_the_LB.26SCR","#Continental_Traffic_Agreement_.281863.29","#Improvements_to_the_main_line","#Charing_Cross_and_Cannon_Street_Stations","#Orpington_cut-off_.26_Dartford_Loop","#East_London_Railway","#Chairmanship_of_Edward_Watkin","#Oxted_.26_Westerham_Lines","#Unpopularity_of_the_SER","#Later_branches_and_proposed_lines","#Chatham_extension","#London_suburbs","#South_Eastern_and_Chatham_Railways_Joint_Management_Committee","#Train_services","#Freight_services","#Passenger_services","#London_suburban_services","#Holiday_traffic","#Continental_excursions","#Hop_picking","#Communications.2C_Signalling_and_Accidents","#Electric_telegraph","#Signals_and_signal_boxes","#Accidents","#Rolling_stock","#Steam_locomotives","#Locomotive_Superintendents.2FChief_Mechanical_Engineers","#Ships","#See_also","#References","#Sources","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=South_Eastern_Railway,_UK&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/River_Medway","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Local_and_Personal_Acts_of_Parliament_in_the_United_Kingdom","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=South_Eastern_Railway,_UK&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/South_Eastern_Main_Line","/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Commons_(United_Kingdom)","#cite_note-3","/wiki/London_and_Southampton_Railway","/wiki/Wimbledon,_London","/wiki/London_and_Gree
