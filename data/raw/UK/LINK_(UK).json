The network counts 37 member institutions, of\nwhich many are various banks and building societies issuing LINK ATM cards, and\nthe remainder are independent ATM operators who do not issue cards. The network connects 63,000 ATMs - virtually every ATM in\nthe United Kingdom.\n\nThe LINK network infrastructure is operated by 'VocaLink', a company formed in\n2007 by the merger of 'LINK Interchange Network Limited' and Voca\nLimited. The LINK ATM scheme is a separate entity which is owned (in\npart) by the scheme members.\n\nIn addition to providing the core ATM transaction switching and settlement\nservice to its ATM network members, VocaLink Limited provides outsourced ATM,\ncard and mobile payment services and provides access to Post Office counters for\nbasic banking transactions.\n\nIn 2003, LINK co-founded a mobile banking application called MONILINK, in a\n50:50 joint venture with Morse plc business unit Monitise(sic) . In 2009 LINK's\nshare was bought out by Monitise, though VocaLink continued to provide the\ntechnical infrastructure for the service.\n\nLINK also provides a prepay mobile phone top up facility at 50,000 ATMs, and is\ndeveloping the Faster Payments Service that launched in the UK in\n2008.
