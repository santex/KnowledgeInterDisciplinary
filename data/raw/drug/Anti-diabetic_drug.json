{"cursor":"33894","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Anti-diabetic medications' treat diabetes mellitus by lowering glucose levels\nin the blood. With the exceptions of insulin, exenatide, liraglutide and\npramlintide, all are administered orally and are thus also called 'oral\nhypoglycemic agents' or 'oral antihyperglycemic agents'. There are different\nclasses of anti-diabetic drugs, and their selection depends on the nature of the\ndiabetes, age and situation of the person, as well as other factors.\n\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is a disease caused by the lack of insulin. Insulin\nmust be used in Type I, which must be injected.\n\nDiabetes mellitus type 2 is a disease of insulin resistance by cells. Treatments\ninclude (1) agents that increase the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas,\n(2) agents that increase the sensitivity of target organs to insulin, and (3)\nagents that decrease the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the\ngastrointestinal tract.\n\nSeveral groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, are effective in Type II, often\nin combination. The therapeutic combination in Type II may include insulin, not\nnecessarily because oral agents have failed completely, but in search of a\ndesired combination of effects. The great advantage of injected insulin in Type\nII is that a well-educated patient can adjust the dose, or even take additional\ndoses, when blood glucose levels measured by the patient, usually with a simple\nmeter, as needed by the measured amount of sugar in the blood.\n","linknr":900,"url":"Anti-diabetic_drug","recorded":1362482040,"links":36,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/DiabetesUpdate-FINAL-Feb09.pdf","http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/DiabetesUpdate-FINAL-Feb09.pdf","http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/155/645/Oral%20Diabetes_ExSumm%20%282%29.pdf","http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/155/645/Oral%20Diabetes_ExSumm%20%282%29.pdf"],"categories":["Anti-diabetic drugs"],"headings":["Insulin","Comparison","Sensitizers","Secretagogues","Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors","Peptide analogs","Natural substances","References","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Incretins_and_DPP_4_inhibitors.svg/300px-Incretins_and_DPP_4_inhibitors.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Diabetes_mellitus","Glucose","Insulin","Exenatide","Liraglutide","Pramlintide","Diabetes_mellitus_type_1","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Subcutaneous_tissue","Insulin_pump","Sulfonylurea","Glyburide","Glimepiride","Glipizide","Beta_cell","ATP-sensitive_potassium_channel","Blood_pressure","Low-density_lipoprotein","Human_gastrointestinal_tract","Weight_gain","Hypoglycemia","Metformin","Insulin_resistance","LDL_cholesterol","Triglycerides","Human_gastrointestinal_tract","Kidney_disease","Heart_failure","Lactic_acidosis","Vitamin_B12_deficiency","Metallic_taste","Alpha-glucosidase_inhibitor","Acarbose","Miglitol","Small_intestine","Glycated_hemoglobin","Thiazolidinediones","Pioglitazone","Rosiglitazone","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_gamma","High-density_lipoprotein","Heart_failure","Weight_gain","Edema","Anemia","Hepatoxicity","Insulin_resistance","Biguanide","Liver","Kidney","Metformin","Glycated_hemoglobin","Metformin","Iodine","Radiocontrast","Lactic_acidosis","Phenformin","Buformin","Gastrointestinal","Thiazolidinedione","TZD","Peroxisome_proliferator-activated_receptor_gamma","Glycated_hemoglobin","Rosiglitazone","European_Medicines_Agency","Pioglitazone","Troglitazone","Hepatitis","Wired_News","The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Glycemic_control","Pioglitazone","Sulfonylurea","ATP-sensitive_potassium_channel","Beta_cell","Plasma_protein","Hypoglycemia","Glycated_hemoglobin","Tolbutamide","Acetohexamide","Tolazamide","Chlorpropamide","Glipizide","Glibenclamide","Glimepiride","Gliclazide","Glycopyramide","Gliquidone","Meglitinide","Glycated_hemoglobin","Repaglinide","Nateglinide","Alpha-glucosidase_inhibitor","Impaired_glucose_tolerance","Type_2_diabetes","Glycated_hemoglobin","Miglitol","Acarbose","Voglibose","Blood_sugar","Alpha_glucosidase_inhibitor","Incretin","Secretagogue","Glucagon-like_peptide-1","Gastric_inhibitory_peptide","Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4","Exenatide","Glucagon-like_peptide-1","Type_2_diabetes","Glycated_hemoglobin","Liraglutide","Novo_Nordisk","Victoza","European_Medicines_Agency","U.S._Food_and_Drug_Administration","Taspoglutide","Hoffman-La_Roche","Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4_inhibitors","Incretin","Dipeptidyl_peptidase-4","Vildagliptin","Sitagliptin","Saxagliptin","Linagliptin","Allogliptin","Septagliptin","DPP-4_inhibitors","Glycated_hemoglobin","Sitagliptin","Saxagliptin","Vildagliptin","Alogliptin","Amylin","Glucagon","Pramlintide","Subcutaneous_injection","Nausea","Cinnamon","Australian_Sandalwood","Indian_Kino_tree","Bioassay-directed_fractionation","Isoorientin","Vanadium","Thiamine"]}
