Such devices are proposed to\nrepresent useful medical implants. J. A. Rogers et al \"Epidermal\nElectronics\" Science 2011, Vol. 333 no. 6044 pp. 838-843.\n\nOrganic electronic devices as compostable material platforms have been\nfabricated on aluminum foil and paper  to accommodate these expanded functionalities. In one\nembodiment of this idea, paper films were utilized as a combination substrate\nand gate dielectric for use with pentacene-based active layers. This idea was expanded upon to create complete circuits using\nfoldable paper-based substrates.\n\nSilk coatings could underpin a electronic devices because it melts away when the\ndevice is no longer needed. One test device, a heating circuit powered by\nbeaming radio waves at it, was implanted under the skin of a rat with a wound.\nAfter the wound had healed, the implant simply melts away. The US military\nresearch agency DARPA funded research on building a tiny dissolving camera with\nthis silk coating for use as a disposable spy camera.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Biodegradable_electronics","recorded":1362506038,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electronics and the environment"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Biodegradation","Pentacene"]}
