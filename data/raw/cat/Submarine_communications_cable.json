The\nfirst submarine communications cables, laid in the 1850s, carried telegraphy\ntraffic. Subsequent generations of cables carried telephone traffic, then data\ncommunications traffic. Modern cables use optical fiber technology to carry\ndigital data, which includes telephone, Internet and private data traffic.\n\nModern cables are typically in diameter and weigh around 10 kilograms per metre\n(7 lb/ft), although thinner and lighter cables are used for deep-water sections.
