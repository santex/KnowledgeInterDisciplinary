This is achieved by\nreacting the material at high temperatures (>700 Â°C), without combustion, with a\ncontrolled amount of oxygen and/or steam. The resulting gas mixture is called\n[[syngas]] (from synthesis gas or synthetic gas) or [[producer gas]] and is\nitself a fuel. The power derived from gasification and combustion of the\nresultant gas is considered to be a source of renewable energy if the gasified\ncompounds were obtained from biomass.

Syngas may be burned directly in gas engines, used to produce\nmethanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer-Tropsch process into\nsynthetic fuel. Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise\nhave been disposed of such as biodegradable waste. In addition, the high-\ntemperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and\npotassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels.\nGasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to\ngenerate electricity.\n","linknr":427,"url":"Biomass_gasification","recorded":1362500117,"links":47,"instances":["chemical_science"],"pdf":["http://www.iec.tu-freiberg.de/conference/conference_05/pdf/21_Picard.pdf","http://www.iec.tu-freiberg.de/conference/conference_05/pdf/21_Picard.pdf","http://www.biocellus.com/pdf/High_temperature_electrolyte.pdf","http://www.clarke-energy.co.uk/case-studies/Case%20Study%20Gussing.pdf","http://www.idgte.ca/Pagemill_Resources/Presentations_0608/GEJenbacher%20Presentation.pdf"],"categories":["Energy conversion","Power station technology","Thermal treatment","Waste treatment technology","Fuel gas","Gas technologies","Synthetic fuel technologies","Sustainable technologies","Pyrolysis"],"headings":["History","Chemical Reactions","Gasification processes","Feedstock","Current applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/El-v-01_ubt.jpeg/180px-El-v-01_ubt.jpeg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/16px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Wind-turbine-icon.svg/16px-Wind-turbine-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/16px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Adler_Diplomat_3_GS_mit_Holzgasgenerator-hinten_rechts.JPG/220px-Adler_Diplomat_3_GS_mit_Holzgasgenerator-hinten_rechts.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/Pyrolysis.svg/150px-Pyrolysis.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Gasification.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/d/8/bd831bf9e277c3a479cb53d5ca349075.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/4/8/948b09ea2d011506a4bbcb9932b2dded.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/f/07f2e21e12c0929264f7c990ee734f98.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Reactor_.jpg/150px-Reactor_.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Holzvergasung.jpg/230px-Holzvergasung.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Wind-turbine-icon.svg/28px-Wind-turbine-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["leaching","chemical_science"]],"members":["leaching"],"related":["Biomass","Fossil_fuel","Carbonaceous","Carbon_monoxide","Hydrogen","Carbon_dioxide","Oxygen","Steam","Renewable_energy","National_Non-Food_Crops_Centre","Fuel_cell","Carnot's_rule","Internal_combustion_engines","Methanol","Fischer-Tropsch_process","Synthetic_fuel","Organic_waste","Chloride","Potassium","Fossil_fuels","Electricity","Coal","Peat","Town_gas","Natural_gas","Blast_furnaces","Chemical_synthesis","World_wars","Second_World_War","Wood_gas_generator","Europe","Dehydration_reaction","Charring","Organic_compound","Reversible_reaction","Water_gas_shift_reaction","Chemical_equilibrium","Water","Residence_time","Catalysts","Fluidized_bed","Slag","Fluidization","Elutriation","Operating_temperature","Fly_ash","Plasma_gasification","Municipal_Solid_Waste","Refuse-derived_fuel","Chemrec","Black_liquor","Flue_gas","Electric_power","Internal_combustion_engine","Gas_turbine","Rankine_cycle","Gas_to_liquids","Environment_Agency","Chiba,_Chiba","Japan","USA","Ze-gen","New_Bedford,_Massachusetts","GreenTech","Oven","Furnace","Boiler","Heating_value","Integrated_Gasification_Combined_Cycle","Diesel_engine","Spark_ignition_engine","Solid_oxide_fuel_cell","DIY","United_States","Dimethyl_ether","Sabatier_reaction","Fischer-Tropsch","Leaching_(chemical_science)","Greenhouse_gases","Biodiesel","Carbon_neutral","Sweden","District_heating","Biomass_fuels","Chromated_copper_arsenate","Creosote","Cogeneration","District_heating","Güssing","GE_Jenbacher","Gas_engine","Piteå","Coal_gasification","Fluidized_bed_combustion","History_of_manufactured_gas","Isle_of_Wight_gasification_facility","List_of_solid_waste_treatment_technologies","Plasma_arc_waste_disposal","Renewable_natural_gas","Water_gas"]}
