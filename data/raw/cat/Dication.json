{"cursor":"1791","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Distinguish from [[dictation]]. A 'dication' is any cation, of general formula\n2+ , formed by the removal of two electrons from a neutral species.\n\nDiatomic dications corresponding to stable neutral species (e.g.\nH 22+ formed by removal of two electrons from\nH 2) often decay quickly into two singly charged particles\n(H +), due to the loss of electrons in bonding molecular orbitals.\nEnergy levels of diatomic dications can be studied with good resolution by\nmeasuring the yield of pairs of zero-kinetic-energy electrons from double\nphotoionization of a molecule as a function of the photoionizing wavelength\n(threshold photoelectrons coincidence spectroscopy - TPEsCO). The\nHe 22+ dication is kinetically stable.\n\nAn example of a stable diatomic dication which is not formed by oxidation of a\nneutral diatomic molecule is the dimercury dication Hg 22+ .\nAn example of a polyatomic dication is S 82+ , formed by\noxidation of S 8 and unstable with respect to further oxidisation over\ntime to form SO 2.\n\nMany organic dications can be detected in mass spectrometry for example\nCH 42+ (a CH 22+ , H2 complex) and the\nacetylene dication C 2H 22+ .Lammertsma, K.,\nvon RaguÃ© Schleyer, P. and Schwarz, H.
