The Daily Cartoonist, July 8, 2009.]\n\nUniversal Press Syndicate was founded by John McMeel and Jim Andrews in 1970,\ntwo graduates of Notre Dame. Their early syndication success came as a result of\nAndrews reading the [[Yale Daily News]]. While clipping a column by a priest, he\nwas distracted by Garry Trudeau's Bull Tales comic strip on the facing page.\nWhen Trudeau's [[Doonesbury]] debuted as a daily strip in two dozen newspapers\non October 26, 1970, it was the first strip from Universal Press Syndicate, and\na Sunday strip was launched March 21, 1971. Circulation of Doonesbury eventually\nexpanded to more than 1,400 newspapers internationally.
