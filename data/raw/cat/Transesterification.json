{"cursor":"4341","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In organic chemistry, 'transesterification' is the process of exchanging the\norganic group Râ³ of an ester with the organic group Râ² of an alcohol. These\nreactions are often catalyzed by the addition of an acid or base catalyst. The\nreaction can also be accomplished with the help of enzymes (biocatalysts)\nparticularly lipases (E.C.3.1.1.3).\n\n\n\nStrong acids catalyse the reaction by donating a proton to the carbonyl group,\nthus making it a more potent electrophile, whereas bases catalyse the reaction\nby removing a proton from the alcohol, thus making it more nucleophilic. Esters\nwith larger alkoxy groups can be made from methyl or ethyl esters in high purity\nby heating the mixture of ester, acid/base, and large alcohol and evaporating\nthe small alcohol to drive equilibrium.\n","linknr":141,"url":"Transesterification","recorded":1362500064,"links":23,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Substitution reactions"],"headings":["Mechanism","Applications","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Transesterification.png/500px-Transesterification.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/General_transesterification_mechanism.png/500px-General_transesterification_mechanism.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["base","chemistry"]],"members":["base"],"related":["Organic_chemistry","Ester","Alcohol","Catalyst","Acid","Base_(chemistry)","Carbonyl","Electrophile","Nucleophile","Polyester","Dimethyl_terephthalate","Ethylene_glycol","Polyethylene_terephthalate","Methanol","Plastic_recycling","Triglycerides","Biodiesel","Vegetable_oil","Biodiesel","World_War_II","Patented","United_States","Colgate-Palmolive","Biolipid","Glycerine","Explosives","Biolipid","Biolipid","Protecting_group","Chiral_auxiliary","Biodiesel_production","Interesterified_fat","Otera's_catalyst","Transalkylation","Transamidification"]}
