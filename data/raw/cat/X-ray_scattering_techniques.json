{"cursor":"3494","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'X-ray scattering techniques' are a family of non-destructive analytical\ntechniques which reveal information about the crystal structure, chemical\ncomposition, and physical properties of materials and thin films. These\ntechniques are based on observing the scattered intensity of an X-ray beam\nhitting a sample as a function of incident and scattered angle, polarization,\nand wavelength or energy. Note that X-ray scattering is different from X-ray\ndiffraction, which is widely used for X-ray crystallography.\n","linknr":144,"url":"X-ray_scattering_techniques","recorded":1362481760,"links":42,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["X-ray scattering"],"headings":["Scattering techniques","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg/250px-X-ray_diffraction_pattern_3clpro.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intensity","physics"]],"members":["intensity"],"related":["Scientific_technique","Crystal_structure","Scattering","Intensity_(physics)","X-ray","Diffraction","X-ray_crystallography","Elastic_collision","Small-angle_X-ray_scattering","X-ray_reflectivity","Wide-angle_X-ray_scattering","Inelastic_collision","Electronic_band_structure","Compton_scattering","Resonant_inelastic_X-ray_scattering","X-ray_Raman_scattering","Structure_determination","Materials_science","Metallurgy","Mineralogy","X-ray_crystallography","X-ray_generator","Ultrafast_x-rays","University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara"]}
