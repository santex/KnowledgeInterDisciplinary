It was\nestablished in September 2006, and took over the functions of the Scottish\nExaminations Board and the 'Scottish Vocational Education Council' in April 2007\n\nIt is partly funded by the Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate of the\nScottish Government, employing 750 staff, based in Glasgow and\nDalkeith. [http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/5656.html SQA - About SQA ] Students for National Qualifications receive their\nresults on, generally, the first Tuesday in August. Students signed up for the\nauthority's MySQA system are able to check their record online throughout the\nyear and get their exam results by text and/or email on the day that the results\nare issued. Those signed up to the service in 2010 received their results one\nday earlier than the official postal results. This also occurred in 2011,\nhowever only due to a mistake by the company holding the results. In 2012 the\nSQA itself sent the results out on the right day, but Robert Gordon University's\nbusiness school leaked whether students had been let\nin, http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/58590.html and a technical error with St\nAndrew's University's website leaked the results of\napplicants. http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/58571.html\n\nSQA is one of the four partner national organisations involved in the Curriculum\nfor Excellence. It works with partners on all strands of the development. Its\nprincipal role is to contribute to work on qualifications and assessment. SQAâs\nrole in Curriculum for Excellence is to design and develop the new\nqualifications and assessment.\n\nSQA is perhaps best known for the delivery of the annual diet of public\nexaminations within Scotland; each year the Authority organises public\nexaminations in a wide range of subjects, at various levels, for school pupils\nand college students. However, a greater number of candidates of all ages\nparticipates in SQA specialist, vocational and higher education qualifications.\n\nSQA Higher examinations are the general acceptable level for entry to\nUniversity. Scottish universities usually request a minimum of 3 Highers, all\nabove C level.\n\nThe SQA's functions and responsibilities are laid out in the Education\n(Scotland) Act 1996 as amended by the Scottish Qualifications Act 2002.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Scottish_Qualifications_Authority","recorded":1362583772,"links":18,"instances":["2000","scotland_act_1996","scottish"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Education in Scotland","Educational qualifications in Scotland|","Organisations based in Glasgow","Qualification awarding bodies in the United Kingdom","School examinations","Scottish Government Learning and Justice Directorate|Qualifications Authority","Executive non-departmental public bodies of the Scottish Government|Qualifications Authority","Government agencies established in 1996","1996 establishments in Scotland","Higher education in Scotland","Vocational education in Scotland"],"headings":["Main Qualification Types","Other qualifications","Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework","Responsibilities","Layout of the Examinations","National Assessment Bank","History","Controversy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a5/Sqa_logo.png/188px-Sqa_logo.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/65/SQA_EXAM_LAYOUT.png/220px-SQA_EXAM_LAYOUT.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/MYSQA.png/220px-MYSQA.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/SQA_Papers.png/220px-SQA_Papers.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["education","scotland_act_1996"],["higher","scottish"],["sqa_examinations_controversy","2000"]],"members":["sqa_examinations_controversy","education","higher"],"related":["Scottish_Gaelic","Scottish_public_bodies","Scottish_Government","Scottish_Examinations_Board","Education_and_Lifelong_Learning_Directorate","Scottish_Government","Glasgow","Dalkeith","Robert_Gordon_University","St_Andrew's_University","Curriculum_for_Excellence","Scottish_universities","Education_(Scotland)_Act_1996","Scottish_Qualifications_Act_2002","High_School","Standard_Grade","Intermediate_1","Intermediate_2","Higher_(Scottish)","Advanced_Higher","English_language","Mathematics","Accounting","Mental_Health","Scottish_Qualifications_Certificate","Scottish_Qualification_Authority","Prelim_Exams","Vocational_education","United_Kingdom","Employer","National_Vocational_Qualification","England","Wales","Northern_Ireland","Higher_Education","Higher_National_Certificate","Higher_National_Diploma","British_Sign_Language","Quality_Assurance_Agency_for_Higher_Education","Scottish_Government","Scottish_Credit_and_Qualifications_Framework","SCQF","China","Africa","Middle_East","Russia","National_Assessment_Bank","CSYS","Glasgow","Dalkeith","Chief_Executive","Ron_Tuck","SQA_examinations_controversy_(2000)","Higher_Grade"]}
