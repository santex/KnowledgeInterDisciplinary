{"cursor":"2593","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Implication' is the relationship between the two statements of a conditional\nstatement A , called the antecedent and B , called the\nconsequent when A implies B .\n\nIn logic, logical consequence is a fundamental concept which is often used\nsynonymously with 'implication'. However, sometimes the term is used to\ndistinguish between:\n* '[[Logical consequence|Logical implication]]', (also 'implication' or\n  'entailment', or the 'consequence relation'), a relation between statements\n  when one A implies the other B ; and\n* '[[Material conditional |Material implication]]', (also 'material\n  conditional', 'conditional' or 'conditional implication'), a logical\n  connective and binary truth function.\n::*In propositional logic, ' material implication' is a valid rule of\n::replacement which is an instance of the connective of the same name. It is the\n::rule that states that \" P implies Q \" is logically\n::equivalent to \"not- P or Q \".\n* 'Definitional implication' -- when one statement implies another by\n  definition. (\"If Jerry is my father, then he is my son's grandfather.\")\n* 'Causal implication' -- when the relation between the antecedent and\n  consequent is discovered empirically. (\"If I put the litmus paper in acid, it\n  will turn red.\")\n* 'Decisional implication' -- when there is no logical connection nor one by\n  definition between the consequent and antecedent. This is a decision of the\n  speaker to behave in the specified way under the specified circumstances. (\"If\n  I'm wrong, I'll eat my hat.\")\n\n'Other uses':\n* In modal logic, '[[Strict conditional|strict implication]]', (also 'strict\n  conditional') is a modal connector, a logical connective of modal logic that\n  expresses necessity.\n* In linguistics, specifically in pragmatics:\n::* Implicature\n::* Entailment (pragmatics)\n* In medical diagnosis, the scientific method, and forensics, a hypothetical\n  cause is implicated or indicated when a reason for the condition can be found,\n  given that cause.\n","linknr":124,"url":"implications","recorded":1362669557,"links":15,"instances":["pragmatics","logic","logic"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophy disambiguation","Conditionals"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/5/9d5ed678fe57bcca610140957afab571.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/5/9d5ed678fe57bcca610140957afab571.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/f/c/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/5/9d5ed678fe57bcca610140957afab571.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/c/44c29edb103a2872f519ad0c9a0fdaaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/9/f09564c9ca56850d4cd6b3319e541aee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/4/c/44c29edb103a2872f519ad0c9a0fdaaa.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/9/f09564c9ca56850d4cd6b3319e541aee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/Disambig_gray.svg/30px-Disambig_gray.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["statement","logic"],["antecedent","logic"],["entailment","pragmatics"]],"members":["entailment","statement","antecedent"],"related":["Statement_(logic)","Conditional_sentence","Antecedent_(logic)","Consequent","Logic","Logical_consequence","Concept","Binary_relation","Logical_connective","Binary_function","Truth_function","Propositional_calculus","Valid","Rule_of_replacement","Logical_connective","Logical_equivalence","Empirical_evidence","Modal_logic","Modal_operator","Logical_truth","Linguistics","Pragmatics","Implicature","Entailment_(pragmatics)","Medical_diagnosis","Scientific_method","Forensics"]}
