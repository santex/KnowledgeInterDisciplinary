{"cursor":"51627","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues|original research=February 2011|refimprove=April 2008|\n\n}}\n\nIn broadcasting, 'syndication' is 'the sale of the right' to broadcast radio\nshows and television shows by multiple radio stations and television stations,\nwithout going through a broadcast network, though the process of syndication may\nconjure up structures like those of a network itself, by its very nature\n(citation needed). It is common in countries where broadcast programming is\nscheduled by television networks with local independent affiliates, particularly\nin the United States. In the rest of the world, however, most countries have\ncentralized networks and/or TV stations without local affiliates and syndication\nis less common, although shows can also be syndicated internationally. In the\nfilm industry, film distribution is handled by film distributors.\n","linknr":1067,"url":"Broadcast_syndication","recorded":1362674837,"links":40,"instances":["broadcasting","television","company","north_america","television","radio_host","political_commentator","us_game_show","tv_channel","television","radio_and_television","singer","united_states","film_series","fiction","tv_channel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Broadcasting|Syndication","Television
