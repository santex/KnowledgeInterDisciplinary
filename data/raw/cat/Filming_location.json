{"cursor":"8832","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'', June 2005, on Hollywood Boulevard.]]\n\nA 'filming location' is a place where some or all of a film or television series\nis produced, in addition to or instead of using sets constructed on a movie\nstudio backlot or soundstage. For example, the television series [[24\n(TV series)|24]] is filmed primarily on location except for some scenes which\nare always filmed on the same sets.\n\nIn filmmaking, a 'location' is any place where a film crew will be filming\nactors and recording their dialog. A location where dialog is not recorded may\nbe considered as a second unit photography site. Filmmakers often choose to\nshoot on location because they believe that greater realism can be achieved in a\n\"real\" place, however location shooting is also often motivated by the film's\nbudget. For instance, the independent horror film ''Marianne'' was shot entirely\non location in Sweden. However, many films shoot interior scenes on a sound\nstage and exterior scenes on location.\n\nIt is often mistakenly believed that filming \"on location\" takes place in the\nactual location in which its story is set, but this is not necessarily the case.\n","linknr":326,"url":"Filming_location","recorded":1362665373,"links":23,"instances":["comics","film","province","film","film","2011_film","los_angeles","arts","film","2002_film"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Film shooting locations|"],"headings":["Types of locations","Substitute locations","Gallery","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5a/Black_Dahlia_Film_Shoot_3.jpg/220px-Black_Dahlia_Film_Shoot_3.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Weird_Science_house_north_view.JPG/120px-Weird_Science_house_north_view.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/78/Ferris_Bueller_house_northeast_view.JPG/120px-Ferris_Bueller_house_northeast_view.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b6/American_Pie_house_west_view.JPG/120px-American_Pie_house_west_view.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Donnie_Darko_house_northwest_view.JPG/120px-Donnie_Darko_house_northwest_view.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Mount_Carmel_High_School_%28Los_Angeles%29_pic.JPG/120px-Mount_Carmel_High_School_%28Los_Angeles%29_pic.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["realism","arts"],["marianne","2011_film"],["almería","province"],["gorky_park","film"],["blood_diamond","film"],["queen_of_the_damned","film"],["amadeus","film"],["the_bourne_identity","2002_film"],["metropolis","comics"],["washington","u.s._state"],["mount_carmel_high_school","los_angeles"]],"members":["metropolis","gorky_park","almería","amadeus","washington","blood_diamond","marianne","mount_carmel_high_school","realism","queen_of_the_damned","the_bourne_identity"],"related":["Hollywood_Boulevard","Film","Television_series","Set_construction","Movie_studio","Backlot","Soundstage","Second_unit","Realism_(arts)","Marianne_(2011_film)","Sweden","Location_shooting","Sound_stage","Backlot","Almería_(province)","Spain","Spaghetti_Western","Augusta,_Georgia","Boston,_Massachusetts","Bath,_Somerset","Boston,_Massachusetts","Bristol","Peckham","London","Berlin","Germany","Paris","London","Moscow","Russia","Birmingham","Brent_Cross","Hamburg","Budapest","Hungary","Paris","Cadiz","Havana","Cuba","Chicago,_Illinois","Chicago_'L'","New_York_elevated_railway","Glasgow","Scotland","Apostolic_Palace","Dubuque,_Iowa","Iowa","Cleveland","Boston","California","Vietnam","Garrison,_New_York","Yonkers,_New_York","Gibsons,_British_Columbia","Marblehead,_Massachusetts","Gorky_Park_(film)","Glod,_Dâmboviţa","Romania","Kazakhstan","Hamilton,_Ontario","Hawaii","West_Africa","Brazil","Amazon_River","Helsinki","Finland","Hedsor_House","England","Isle_of_Man","Ireland","Iceland","Himalayas","Iwo_Jima","Lincoln_Cathedral","Westminster_Abbey","Liverpool","Madrid","Malta","Sparta","Rome","Rome","Beirut","Cyprus","Tel_Aviv","Athens","Manchester","Maputo","Mozambique","Sierra_Leone","Blood_Diamond_(film)","Melbourne","Australia","Queen_of_the_Damned_(film)","Mount_Taranaki/Egmont","New_Zealand","Himeji","Kyoto","Japan","Oxford","China","Prague","Czech_Republic","Vienna","Austria","Amadeus_(film)","Zürich","Switzerland","The_Bourne_Identity_(2002_film)","Puerto_Rico","Brazil","Romania","Roslyn,_Washington","Alaska","Slovakia","Wales","North_Korea","St_Pancras,_London","Arkham_Asylum","Gotham_City","Saint_Petersburg","Sydney","Metropolis_(comics)","Thailand","List_of_films_that_use_Thailand_as_a_location","Vietnam_War","Port_of_Tilbury","Essex","Toronto","Canada","Chicago","New_York_City","Vancouver_film_locations","Canada","Washington_(U.S._state)","Seattle,_Washington","Vienna","Austria","Bratislava","Czechoslovakia","Winnetka,_Illinois","Chicago,_Illinois","Teen_film","Mount_Carmel_High_School_(Los_Angeles)","Location_shooting","Location_manager","Location_scouting","Location_library","Filmmaking"]}
