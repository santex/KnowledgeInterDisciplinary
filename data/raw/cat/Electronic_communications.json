Other examples of pre-\nmodern \"telecommunication\" include audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-\nblown horns, and loud whistles. Electrical and electromagnetic telecommunication\ntechnologies include telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, radio, microwave\ntransmission, fiber optics, communications satellites and the Internet.\n\nA revolution in wireless telecommunications began in the first decade of the\n1900s with pioneering developments in radio communications by Nikola Tesla and\nGuglielmo Marconi. Marconi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 for his\nefforts. Other highly notable pioneering inventors and developers in the field\nof electrical and electronic telecommunications include Charles Wheatstone and\nSamuel Morse (telegraph), Alexander Graham Bell (telephone), Edwin Armstrong,\nand Lee de Forest (radio), as well as John Logie Baird and Philo Farnsworth\n(television).\n\nThe world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way\ntelecommunication networks grew from 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed)\ninformation in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed)\nexabytes in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007.

Given this growth, telecommunications\nplay an increasingly important role in the world economy and the global\ntelecommunications industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012.

[http://www.plunkettresearch.com/telecommunications-\nmarket-research/industry-and-business-data/statistics Introduction to the\nTelecommunications Industry], Internet Engineering Task Force, June 2012.\nThe service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was estimated to\nbe $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the worldâs gross domestic\nproduct (GDP).\n","linknr":1848,"url":"Electronic_communications","recorded":1362683903,"links":141,"instances":["radio","communication","communications","biaxially_oriented","journal","ghosting","telecommunications","united_kingdom","protocol","telecommunications","electronics","computing","telecommunications","computing","telecommunications","electrical_engineering","satellite_communications","signal_processing","electricity","video","radio"],"pdf":["http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs_iportals/iportals/aboutus/history_center/conferences/che2004/Dilhac.pdf","http://www.itu.int/itudoc/gs/promo/tsb/88192.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660009169_1966009169.pdf","http://www.passeursdimages.fr/IMG/pdf/projections13.pdf","http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_News.and.Broadband.pdf","http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_News.and.Broadband.pdf","http://adage.com/images/random/datacenter/2008/spendtrends08.pdf","http://adage.com/images/random/datacenter/2008/spendtrends08.pdf","https://www.itu.int/osg/csd/wtpf/wtpf2009/documents/ITU_ITRs_88.pdf","http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/mels/cm1500/dwdm/dwdm_ovr.pdf","http://www.dynamix.ca/doc/HDVhandbook1.pdf","http://www.informit.com/content/images/0735709777/samplechapter/0735709777.pdf"],"categories":["History
