{"cursor":"13344","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"), a macroinvertebrate used as an indicator of water quality.]]\n\n'Biological indicators' are species that can be used to monitor the health of an\nenvironment or ecosystem. They are any biological species or group of species\nwhose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or\nenvironmental integrity is present. One example of a group of bioincators are\nthe copepods and other small water crustaceans that are present in many water\nbodies. Such organisms can be monitored for changes (biochemical, physiological,\nor behavioural) that may indicate a problem within their ecosystem.\nBioindicators can tell us about the cumulative effects of different pollutants\nin the ecosystem and about how long a problem may have been present, which\nphysical and chemical testing cannot.\n\nA 'biological [[wikt:monitor|monitor]]', or 'biomonitor', can be defined as an\norganism that provides quantitative information on the quality of the\nenvironment around it. Therefore, a good biomonitor will indicate the presence\nof the pollutant and also attempt to provide additional information about the\namount and intensity of the exposure.\n\nA 'bioindicator' is an organism or biological response that reveals the presence\nof the pollutants by the occurrence of typical symptoms or measurable responses,\nand is therefore more qualitative. These organisms (or communities of organisms)\ndeliver information on alterations in the environment or the quantity of\nenvironmental pollutants by changing in one of the following ways:\nphysiologically, chemically or behaviourally. The information can be deduced\nthrough the study of: #their content of certain elements or compounds #their\nmorphological or cellular structure #metabolic-biochemical processes #behaviour,\nor #population structure(s).\n\nThe importance and relevance of biomonitors, rather than man-made equipment, is\njustified by the statement: \"There is no better indicator of the status of a\nspecies or a system than a species or system itself.\"\n\nThe use of a biomonitor is described as biological monitoring (abbr.\nbiomonitoring) and is the use of the properties of an organism to obtain\ninformation on certain aspects of the biosphere. Biomonitoring of air\npollutants can be passive or active. Passive methods observe plants growing\nnaturally within the area of interest. Active methods detect the presence of\nair pollutants by placing test plants of known response and genotype into the\nstudy area.\n\nBioaccumulative indicators are frequently regarded as biomonitors.\n\nDepending on the organism selected and their use, there are several types of\nbioindicators. {{cite web\n| url=http://www.biobasics.gc.ca/english/View.asp?x=740 | author=Government of\n| Canada | accessdate= | title=Biobasics: Bioindicators}} 2008-07-08.\n","linknr":261,"url":"Bioindicator","recorded":1362509011,"links":38,"instances":["biophysical","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf","http://www.environment.gov.au/water/publications/environmental/rivers/nrhp/pubs/signal.pdf","http://www.environment.gov.au/water/publications/environmental/rivers/nrhp/pubs/signal.pdf","http://www.dwa.gov.za/iwqs/rhp/methods/dickens%20and%20graham.pdf"],"categories":["Bioindicators|","Ecology","Measurement of biodiversity","Water quality indicators","Water pollution"],"headings":["Plant indicators","Animal indicators and toxins","Microbial indicators and chemical pollutants","Microbial indicators in oil and gas exploration","Macroinvertebrate bioindicators","See also","References","Related Journal","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Trichoptera_caddisfly_1.jpg/220px-Trichoptera_caddisfly_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["environment","biophysical"],["morphology","biology"],["cell","biology"],["environment","biophysical"]],"members":["environment","cell","morphology"],"related":["Macroinvertebrate","Water_quality","Species","Ecosystem","Copepod","Crustacean","Water_body","Physiological","Behavioural","Pollution","Organism","Quantitative_property","Environment_(biophysical)","Qualitative_data","Pollutant","Physiological","Chemical","Behavioural","Chemical_element","Chemical_compound","Morphology_(biology)","Cell_(biology)","Metabolic","Biochemical","Population","Biomonitoring","Genotype","Bioaccumulation","Environmental_preservation","Moss","Lichen","Bark","Bark_pockets","Tree_ring","Leaf","Fungi","Lichen","Fungi","Algae","Conservation_biology","Air_pollution","Sulfur_dioxide","Nitrogen_oxide","Genetically_engineered","Toxicity","Environment_(biophysical)","Population_biology","Pollution","Population_decline","Overpopulation","Toxin","Microorganism","Aquatic_ecosystem","Terrestrial_ecoregion","Proteins","Cadmium","Benzene","Hydrocarbon","Buoyancy","DNA_analysis","Macroinvertebrates","Ecological_health","Australia","Waterwatch","United_States","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Periphyton","Fish","U.S._state","Biosurvey","Water_quality","South_Africa","Aquatic_biomonitoring","ISO/IEC_17025","Department_of_Water_Affairs","Imposex","Dog_conch","Sea_snail","Malaysia","Bioassay","Biological_integrity","Biological_monitoring_working_party","Biosignature","Botanical_prospecting_for_uranium","Ecological_indicator","Environmental_indicator","Indicator_plant","Indicator_species","Indicator_value","Water_pollution"]}
