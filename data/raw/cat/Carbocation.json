Among the\nsimplest examples are methenium , methanium , and ethanium . Some carbocations\nmay have two or more positive charges, on the same carbon atom or on different\natoms; such as ethylene dication . HansjÃ¶rg GrÃ¼tzmacher,\nChristina M. Marchand (1997), \"Heteroatom stabilized carbenium ions\",\nCoordination Chemistry Reviews, volume 163, pages 287-344. \n\nUntil the early 1970s, all carbocations were called carbonium ions. Gold\nBook definition [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C00839.html carbonium ion]\n[http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/C00839.pdf PDF]  In present day chemistry a\ncarbocation is any positively charged carbon atom, and they are classified in\ntwo main categories according to the valence of the charged carbon: three in the\ncarbenium ions (that can be seen as protonated carbenes, hence the name), and\nfive or six in the carbonium ions (protonated alkanes, named by analogy of\nammonium). This nomenclature was proposed by G. A. Olah. \nGeorge A. Olah (1972), \"Stable carbocations. CXVIII.
