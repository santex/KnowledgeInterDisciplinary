{"cursor":"58412","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'[[Education]] reform' is the name given to a political process with the goal of\nimproving public education. Small improvements in education theoretically have\nlarge social returns, in health, wealth and well-being. Historically, reforms\nhave taken different forms because the motivations of reformers have differed. A\nstated motivation has been to reduce cost to students and society. From the\nancient times until the 1800s, one goal was to reduce the expense of a classical\neducation. Ideally, classical education is undertaken with a highly educated full-\ntime (extremely expensive) personal tutor. Historically, this was available only\nto the most wealthy. Encyclopedias, public libraries and grammar schools are\nexamples of innovations intended to lower the cost of a classical education.\n\nRelated reforms attempted to develop similar classical results by concentrating\non \"why\", and \"which\" questions neglected by classical education. Abstract,\nintrospective answers to these questions can theoretically compress large\namounts of facts into relatively few principles. This path was taken by some\nTranscendentalist educators, such as Amos Bronson Alcott. In the early modern\nage, Victorian schools were reformed to teach commercially useful topics, such\nas modern languages and mathematics, rather than classical subjects, such as\nLatin and Greek.\n\nMany reformers focused on reforming society by reforming education on more\nscientific, humanistic, pragmatic or democratic principles. John Dewey, and\nAnton Makarenko are prominent examples of such reformers.\n\nSome reformers incorporated several motivations, e.g. Maria Montessori, who both\n\"educated for peace\" (a social goal), and to \"meet the needs of the child,\" (A\nhumanistic goal.)\n\nIn historic Prussia, an important motivation for the invention of Kindergarten\nwas to foster national unity by teaching a national language while children were\nyoung enough that learning a language was easy.\n\nThe reform has taken many forms and directions. Throughout history and the\npresent day, the meaning and methods of education have changed through debates\nover what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an\neducated society.\n\nChanges may be implemented by individual educators and/or by broad-based school\norganization and/or by curriculum changes with performance evaluations.\n","linknr":540,"url":"Educational_reform","recorded":1362665827,"links":25,"instances":["educationalist","education","think_tank","education"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20081104082039/http://www.uschamber.com/NR/rdonlyres/eguedi4ugpgi5lshzvgvskrgiqw6xeaiiqj5fmtimjwy2xmnknavlu5mngsviu4uhgo3xjb7nmluvqqz54bit7yg5ve/070227jointplatform.pdf","http://www.uschamber.com/NR/rdonlyres/eguedi4ugpgi5lshzvgvskrgiqw6xeaiiqj5fmtimjwy2xmnknavlu5mngsviu4uhgo3xjb7nmluvqqz54bit7yg5ve/070227jointplatform.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20081104082039/http://www.uschamber.com/NR/rdonlyres/eguedi4ugpgi5lshzvgvskrgiqw6xeaiiqj5fmtimjwy2xmnknavlu5mngsviu4uhgo3xjb7nmluvqqz54bit7yg5ve/070227jointplatform.pdf","http://www.ifets.info/journals/14_3/12.pdf"],"categories":["Education
