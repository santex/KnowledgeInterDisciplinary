As part of the lymphatic system, lymph vessels are\ncomplementary to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are lined by\nendothelial cells, and have a thin layer of smooth muscles, and adventitia that\nbind the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to\npropulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are mainly concerned\nwith absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are\nslightly larger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular system. Lymph\nvessels that carry lymph to a lymph node are called the afferent lymph vessel,\nand one that carries it from a lymph node is called the efferent lymph vessel,\nfrom where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a\nvein, or may travel to a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one\nof the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation.\n\nGenerally, lymph flows away from the tissues to lymph nodes and eventually to\neither the right lymphatic duct or the largest lymph vessel in the body, the\nthoracic duct. These vessels drain into the right and left subclavian veins\nrespectively.\n","linknr":504,"url":"Lymph_vessel","recorded":1362553297,"links":40,"instances":["anatomy","physiology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lymphatic system"],"headings":["Function","Diseases of the lymphatic system","Additional images","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Illu_lymph_capillary.jpg/250px-Illu_lymph_capillary.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Gray599.png/250px-Gray599.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Lymph_vessel.png/200px-Lymph_vessel.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Illu_lymphatic_system.jpg/66px-Illu_lymphatic_system.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Gray1093.png/119px-Gray1093.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["circulation","physiology"],["lumen","anatomy"]],"members":["lumen","circulation"],"related":["Terminologia_Anatomica","Anatomy","Valve","Lymph","Lymphatic_system","Cardiovascular_system","Endothelium","Smooth_muscle","Adventitia","Lymph_capillaries","Interstitial_fluid","Lymph_node","Afferent_lymph_vessel","Efferent_lymph_vessel","Lymph_duct","Subclavian_vein","Circulation_(physiology)","Biological_tissue","Lymph_node","Right_lymphatic_duct","Thoracic_duct","Subclavian_veins","Edema","Epithelium","Endothelium","Basement_membrane","Smooth_muscle","Lumen_(anatomy)","Adventitia","Peristalsis","Smooth_muscle","Arterial","Pulse","Fibrous_protein","CD31","Anastomoses","Semilunar_valves","Capillary","Edema","Right_lymphatic_duct","Thoracic_duct","Subclavian_vein","Afferent_lymph_vessel","Efferent_lymph_vessel","Right_lymph_duct","Thoracic_duct","Subclavian_vein","Lymphangiomatosis"]}
