It can be contrasted with the flourish,\nwhere the magician intentionally displays skills, such as the ability to cut\ncards one-handed, which is akin to juggling. Advanced sleight of hand requires\nmonths or years of practice before it can be performed proficiently in front of\nspectators. Sleight of hand is mostly employed in close-up magic, but it can\nalso be used in stage magic. There are hundreds of different sleights at the\nperformer's disposal, but they can generally be classified into groups such as\nswitches, changes, and others.\n\nThere are several stories about magicians using sleight of hand in real life,\nsuch as when American illusionist David Copperfield said he used sleight of hand\nto fool a mugger into thinking he had nothing in his pockets while carrying a\ncellphone, passport and wallet. {{cite web\n | url = http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2006/-\n | 04/25/0425copperfield.html title = Magician David Copperfield robbed after\n | show at Kravis Center accessdate = 2008-01-11\n }}\n","linknr":213,"url":"Pass_(sleight_of_hand)","recorded":1362670290,"links":20,"instances":["illusion","magic","illusionist"],"pdf":["http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/corrections/pdf/cv_b0567.pdf","http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/corrections/pdf/cv_b0567.pdf"],"categories":["Sleight of hand|","Card magic","Coin magic"],"headings":["Etymology and history","Sleight of hand in close-up magic","Principles of sleight of hand","Deceit","Misdirection","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Crystal_Clear_app_Startup_Wizard.png/80px-Crystal_Clear_app_Startup_Wizard.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["magic","illusion"],["david_copperfield","illusionist"],["misdirection","magic"]],"members":["magic","misdirection","david_copperfield"],"related":["Magic_(illusion)","Card_sharp","Card_flourish","Juggling","David_Copperfield_(illusionist)","Robbery","Old_Norse","Seneca_the_Younger","Rhetoric","Close-up_magic","Coin_Magic","Dai_Vernon","Misdirection_(magic)","Penn_&_Teller","Gambling","Confidence_trick","Shell_game","Three-card_monte","Mediumship","Psychics","Mediumship","Close-up_magic","Mentalism","Thumb_tip","Cups_and_balls","French_Drop","Herrmann_pass","Invisible_Turnover_Pass","Tenkai_palm"]}
