{"cursor":"82817","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'platform game' (or 'platformer') is a video game which requires an avatar to\njump to and from suspended platforms or over obstacles (jumping puzzles). The\nplayer must control these jumps to avoid the avatar falling from platforms or\nmissing necessary jumps. The most common unifying element to games in this video\ngame genre is a jump button; other jump mechanics include swinging from\nextendable arms, as in [[Ristar]] or [[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic\nCommando]], or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in [[Alpha Waves]].\nThese mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called\nplatforming, a verbification of platform. Games where jumping is automated\ncompletely, such as [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]], fall outside of\nthe genre.\n\nPlatform games originated in the early 1980s, and 3D successors were popularized\nin the mid-1990s. The term itself describes games where jumping on platforms is\nan integral part of the gameplay, and came into use some time after the genre\nhad been established, but no later than 1983. However, it is not a pure genre and\nis very frequently coupled with elements of other genres, such as the shooter\nelements in [[Contra (video game)|Contra]], the adventure elements of\n[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity|Flashback]] or the RPG elements of\n[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]].\n\nWhile commonly associated with console gaming, there have been many important\nplatform games released to arcades, as well as for handheld systems and home\ncomputers. Europe, North America, and Japan have played major parts in the\ngenre's evolution. Platform themes range from cartoon-like \"mascot\" games to\nscience fiction and fantasy epics.\n\nAt one point, platform games were the most popular genre of video game. At the\npeak of their popularity, it is estimated that between one-quarter and one-third\nof console games were platformers. This estimate is based on counting\nplatform games released on specific systems. For example, on the Sega Master\nSystem, 113 of the 347 games (32.5 percent) listed on vgmuseum.com are platform\ngames, and 264 of the 1044 Sega Genesis games (25.2 percent) are\nplatformers. No genre either before or since has been able to achieve a\nsimilar market share. As of 2006, the genre had become far less dominant,\nrepresenting a 2 percent market share (compared to 15 percent in 1998), but is still commercially viable, with\na number of games selling in the millions of units. Since 2010, a variety of\n\"endless running\" platformers for mobile devices brought renewed popularity to\nthe genre.\n","linknr":1402,"url":"Platform_game","recorded":1362579015,"links":50,"instances":["console","character","video_game","video_game","company","video_games","computing","video_game","software","game_boy","video_games","sixth_generation_era","character","video_games"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Platform
