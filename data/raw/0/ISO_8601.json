It was issued by the International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The\npurpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined\nmethod of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of\nnumeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is\ntransferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric\ndates and times.\n\nThe standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears\nfirst in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It\nalso provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information\nacross time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time\n(UTC).
