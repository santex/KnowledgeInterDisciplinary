It is the first feature film\ndirected by Anton Corbijn, who had worked with Joy Division as a photographer.\nThe screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh was based on the biography [[Touching from a\nDistance]] by Curtis' widow Deborah, who served as a co-producer on the film.\nTony Wilson, who released Joy Division's records through his Factory Records\nlabel, also served as a co-producer. Curtis' bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter\nHook, and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via their\npost-Joy Division act New Order. Control was filmed partly on location in\nNottingham, Manchester, and Macclesfield, including areas where Curtis lived,\nand was shot in colour and then printed to black-and-white. Its title comes from\nthe Joy Division song \"She's Lost Control\"..\n\nSam Riley and Samantha Morton star as Ian and Deborah Curtis, and the film\nportrays the events of the couple's lives from 1973 to 1980, focusing on their\nmarriage, the formation and career of Joy Division, Ian's struggle with\nepilepsy, and his extramarital affair with Belgian journalist Annik HonorÃ©,\nculminating in his May 1980 suicide.
