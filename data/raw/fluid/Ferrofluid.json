{"cursor":"17903","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'ferrofluid' (portmanteau of ferromagnetic, and fluid) is a liquid which\nbecomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field.\n\nFerrofluids are colloidal liquids made of nanoscale ferromagnetic, or\nferrimagnetic, particles suspended in a fluid (usually an organic solvent or\nwater). Each tiny particle is thoroughly coated with a surfactant to inhibit\nclumping. Large ferromagnetic particles can be ripped out of the homogeneous\ncolloidal mixture, forming a separate clump of magnetic dust when exposed to\nstrong magnetic fields. The magnetic attraction of nanoparticles is weak enough\nthat the surfactant's Van der Waals force is sufficient to prevent magnetic\nclumping or agglomeration. Ferrofluids usually do not\nretain magnetization in the absence of an externally applied field and thus are\noften classified as \"superparamagnets\" rather than ferromagnets.\n\nThe difference between ferrofluids and magnetorheological fluids (MR fluids) is\nthe size of the particles. The particles in a ferrofluid primarily consist of\nnanoparticles which are suspended by Brownian motion and generally will not\nsettle under normal conditions. MR fluid particles primarily consist of micrometre-\nscale particles which are too heavy for Brownian motion to keep them suspended,\nand thus will settle over time because of the inherent density difference\nbetween the particle and its carrier fluid. These two fluids have very different\napplications as a result.\n","linknr":324,"url":"Ferrofluid","recorded":1362512416,"links":44,"instances":["pendulum_song","mechanical","band","computing","band","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/download/v25/v25a10.pdf"],"categories":["Magnetism","Continuum mechanics","Plasma physics","Nanomaterials"],"headings":["Description","Applications","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Ferrofluid_Magnet_under_glass_edit.jpg/350px-Ferrofluid_Magnet_under_glass_edit.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Ferrofluid_poles.jpg/220px-Ferrofluid_poles.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/4/924d20c75d6a4bc38cce8b97182b661f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/f/f7f177957cf064a93e9811df8fe65ed1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/9/d/b9d99db8626de63193c7fe96273a6cae.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Ferrofluid_close.jpg/220px-Ferrofluid_close.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Ferrofluid_in_magnetic_field.jpg/220px-Ferrofluid_in_magnetic_field.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg/25px-Stylised_Lithium_Atom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["suspension","chemistry"],["copper(ii_sulfate"],["manganese(ii_chloride"],["seal","mechanical"],["seal","mechanical"],["pendulum","band"],["watercolour","pendulum_song"],["isis","band"],["doc","computing"]],"members":["watercolour","seal","isis","doc","pendulum","suspension"],"related":["Portmanteau","Ferromagnetic","Fluid","Magnetic_field","Colloidal","Nanoscale","Ferromagnetism","Ferrimagnetic_interaction","Fluid","Organic_solvent","Surfactant","Nanoparticle","Van_der_Waals_force","Agglomeration","Magnetization","Magnetorheological_fluid","Suspension_(chemistry)","Brownian_motion","Magnetite","Hematite","Iron","Paramagnetic","Copper(II)_sulfate","Manganese(II)_chloride","Surfactant","Surfactant","Colloid","Seal_(mechanical)","Lubricant","Nanoelectromechanical_systems","Magnetorheological_fluid","Micrometre","Curie_temperature","Magnetic_field","Magnetic_energy","Gravity","Surface_tension","Specific_surface_energy","Gravitational_energy","Field_strength","Magnetic_susceptibility","Surfactant","Oleic_acid","Tetramethylammonium_hydroxide","Citric_acid","Soy_lecithin","Surfactant","Brownian_motion","Chemical_polarity","Adsorption","Micelle","Steric_effects","Magnetic_saturation","Packing_density","Viscosity","Neodymium_magnet","Seal_(mechanical)","Hard_disk","Friction","Neodymium","Attitude_control","Magnetic_field","Angular_momentum","Optical","Refractive","Magnet","Light","Specific_viscosity","Polarizer","Analyzer","Helium-neon_laser","Medicine","Contrast_agent","Magnetic_resonance_imaging","Cancer","Iron_oxide","Experimental_cancer_treatment","Magnetic_hyperthermia","Heat","Heat_transfer","Thermomagnetic_convection","Microgravity","Loudspeaker","Voice_coil","Damping","Curie's_law","Heat_sink","MEMS","Ferrofluid_mirror","Optical_telescope","Museum","Fountain","Sachiko_Kodama","Art","Pendulum_(band)","Watercolour_(Pendulum_song)","Isis_(band)","Conversation_piece","Smart_fluid","Magnetic_field_viewing_film","Magnetorheological_fluid","Electrorheological_fluid","Magnetohydrodynamics","Magnetic_ionic_liquid","Plasma_physics","Fluid_mechanics","Continuum_mechanics","PDF","DOC_(computing)"]}
