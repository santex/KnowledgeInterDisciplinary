{"cursor":"3563","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Run-length encoding' ('RLE') is a very simple form of data compression in which\nruns of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many\nconsecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather\nthan as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such\nruns: for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, and\nanimations. It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could\ngreatly increase the file size.\n\nRLE may also be used to refer to an early graphics file format supported by\nCompuServe for compressing black and white images, but was widely supplanted by\ntheir later Graphics Interchange Format. RLE also refers to a little-used image\nformat in Windows 3.x, with the extension 'rle', which is a Run Length Encoded\nBitmap, used to compress the Windows 3.x startup screen.\n","linknr":443,"url":"Run-length_encoding","recorded":1362668551,"links":31,"instances":["computing","image_processing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lossless compression algorithms"],"headings":["Example","Applications","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["palette","computing"],["quantization","image_processing"]],"members":["palette","quantization"],"related":["Data_compression","CompuServe","Graphics_Interchange_Format","Windows_3.x","Pixel","Scan_line","ASCII","DEFLATE","LZ77","Lossless_data_compression","Palette_(computing)","JPEG","Quantization_(image_processing)","Truevision_TGA","PackBits","PCX","ILBM","Fax","Modified_Huffman_coding","Kolakoski_sequence","Look-and-say_sequence","Comparison_of_graphics_file_formats","Golomb_coding","Modified_Huffman_coding","Burrows-Wheeler_transform","Run_Length_Limited","Bitmap_index","Forsythâ€“Edwards_Notation","Rosetta_Code"]}
