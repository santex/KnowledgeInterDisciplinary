A disk\nimage is usually created by creating a complete sector-by-sector copy of the\nsource medium and thereby perfectly replicating the structure and contents of a\nstorage device.\n\nSome disk imaging utilities omit unused file space from source media, or\ncompress the disk they represent to reduce storage requirements, though\nthese are typically referred to as archive files, as they are not literally\ndisk images.\n\nDisk image file formats may be open standards, such as the ISO image format for\noptical disc images, or proprietary to particular software applications.\n\nA 'tape image' is an image of the contents of a computer's magnetic tape. Image\nfiles derived from magnetic tape data storage are known as tape images.\n","linknr":336,"url":"Disk_image","recorded":1362538583,"links":32,"instances":["file_format","unix","file_format"],"pdf":["http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vsphere4/r40/vsp_40_esx_server_config.pdf","http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vsphere4/r40/vsp_40_esx_server_config.pdf"],"categories":["Archive formats","Computer file formats","Disk image emulators","Disk images|","Hacking (hobbyist)","Optical disc authoring","Virtualization software","Virtual machines","Warez","Optical disc copy protection"],"headings":["History","Uses","Creation","Write utilities","File formats","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["vhd","file_format"],["vdi","file_format"],["dd","unix"],["dd","unix"],["el_torito","cd-rom_standard"]],"members":["vdi","dd","el_torito","vhd"],"related":["Computer_file","Hard_drive","Tape_drive","Floppy_disk","Optical_disc","USB_flash_drive","Disk_sector","Archive_file","File_format","Open_standard","ISO_image","Magnetic_tape","Magnetic_tape_data_storage","Backup","Disk_cloning","Hard_drive","Tape_drive","USB_flash_drive","Floppy_drive","Compact_disc","DVD","Blu-ray_Disc","HD_DVD","Network_share","Random_access_memory","RAM_disk","OTFE","Linux","Mac_OS_X","Loop_device","Microsoft_Windows","Windows_8","Virtual_machine","Linux_distribution","Mac_OS_X","Apple_Disk_Image","Mac_OS_X","Software","Downloads","Web_browser","Apple_Disk_Image","Microsoft_Windows","ISO_image","Windows_7","Comparison_of_disc_image_software","OTFE","FreeOTFE","TrueCrypt","Cleartext","Virtual_Machine_Monitor","Hard_disk_drive","VMDK","VHD_(file_format)","VDI_(file_format)","EnCase","Operating_system","File_locking","Booting","CD","DVD","Short_filename","Commercial_software","Copy_protection","Disk_sector","Metadata","Linux","Dd_(unix)","Live_CD","Windows_Vista","Windows_Vista_startup_process","Standard_operating_environment","Emulator","CD/DVD_copy_protection","Kilobyte","No-CD_crack","Hard_drive","Backup","Optical_media","Disk_image","Floppy_disk","MS-DOS","GNU_General_Public_License","Disk_image","Disk_sector","Unix","Unix-like","Dd_(Unix)","Rawwrite_for_windows","Boot_image","Disk_cloning","Mtools","Loop_device","No-CD_crack","ROM_image","El_Torito_(CD-ROM_standard)","Protected_Area_Run_Time_Interface_Extension_Services","Software_cracking","Comparison_of_disc_image_software","Card_image"]}
