It incorporates cultural and social\naspects of history. Historic plaques are one form of documentation of\nsignificant occurrences in the past and oral histories are another. Local\nhistory is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to\npreserve a local historic building or other historic site. Many works of local\nhistory are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists\nemployed by various organizations. An important aspect of local history is the\npublication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records\nwhich relate to particular areas.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Local_history","recorded":1362574110,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["History","Community","Cultural history","Social history","Fields of history"],"headings":["Geographically contexts","Artistic genre uses","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["national_curriculum","england,_wales_and_northern_ireland"]],"members":["national_curriculum"],"related":["History","Local_community","Cultural_history","Social_history","Oral_history","British_Association_for_Local_History","United_Kingdom","Antiquarian","Victoria_County_History","Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom","Historic_counties_of_England","Institute_of_Historical_Research","University_of_London","Reading_University","Leicester_University","National_Curriculum_(England,_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland)","Alan_Ball_Local_History_Awards","New_media","Public_library","Chartered_Institute_of_Library_and_Information_Professionals","United_States_of_America","Village","Township","USA","National_Register_of_Historic_Places","Historical_societies","If_This_House_Could_Talk","Ukraine","James_Hogg","Scotland","English_local_history","Family_history","Historic_preservation","Microhistory","One-place_study","USA","National_Archives","BBC"]}
