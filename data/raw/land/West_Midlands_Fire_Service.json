[http://www.wmfs.net/Your_Fire_Service/Fire_Authority/ Fire\nAuthority]\n\nThe service was created in 1974 when the West Midlands county came into being.\nPrior to its creation, each of the county boroughs in the West Midlands area\n(Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Solihull, Walsall, Warley, West Bromwich and\nWolverhampton) had their own fire brigade. The largest of these brigades was the\nCity of Birmingham Fire Brigade. The WMFS was created by a merger of these, plus\nparts of Warwickshire Fire Brigade, and is now the second largest and one of the\nbest-performing fire and rescue teams in the\nUK. http://www.wmfs.net/Our_Performance\n\nThe service was originally headquartered in the former City of Birmingham Fire\nBrigade headquarters at Lancaster Circus which were opened on 2 December 1935 by\nHRH Duke of Kent. It is now a Listed building. However, the service moved to\npurpose built, modern headquarters on Vauxhall Road, Nechells, with the move\ncommencing in July 2008 (and being completed by the end of November).\n","linknr":336,"url":"West_Midlands_Fire_Service","recorded":1362570618,"links":22,"instances":["county"],"pdf":["http://www.solihull.gov.uk/akssolihull/images/att21656.pdf"],"categories":["Local government in the West Midlands (county)","Fire and rescue services of England"],"headings":["Organisation","Chief Fire Officers","Fire Stations","Fire appliances","Technical Rescue Unit (Urban Search and Rescue)","Future","Notable Incidents","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/EnglandWestMidlandsCounty.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Bickenhill_Community_Fire_Station%2C_West_Midlands%2C_England-21May2009.jpg/220px-Bickenhill_Community_Fire_Station%2C_West_Midlands%2C_England-21May2009.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6a/BirminghamCorpHydrant.jpg/220px-BirminghamCorpHydrant.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/WMFS_Volvo.JPG/220px-WMFS_Volvo.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["west_midlands","county"],["west_midlands","county"]],"members":["west_midlands"],"related":["West_Midlands_(county)","Birmingham","Statutory","Fire_service_in_the_UK","West_Midlands_(county)","County_borough","Birmingham","Coventry","County_Borough_of_Dudley","Solihull","Walsall","County_Borough_of_Warley","West_Bromwich","Wolverhampton","Historical_Fire_Brigades_of_the_United_Kingdom","City_of_Birmingham_Fire_Brigade","Warwickshire_Fire_Brigade","Lancaster_Circus","Duke_of_Kent","Listed_building","Nechells","Metropolitan_borough","Birmingham","Coventry","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Dudley","Sandwell","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Solihull","Metropolitan_Borough_of_Walsall","Wolverhampton","Moreton-in-Marsh","London_Fire_Brigade","Fire_station","Aston","Sutton_Coldfield","Erdington","Perry_Barr","Ward_End","Handsworth,_West_Midlands","Solihull","Sheldon,_West_Midlands","Coventry","Canley","Foleshill","Binley,_Coventry","Bickenhill","Highgate","Woodgate,_West_Midlands","Smethwick","Bournbrook","Kings_Norton","Northfield,_West_Midlands","Ladywood","Billesley,_West_Midlands","Hay_Mills","Oldbury,_West_Midlands","Brierley_Hill","Stourbridge","Cradley_Heath","Tipton","West_Bromwich","Dudley","Walsall","Bloxwich","Willenhall","Aldridge","Wolverhampton","Fallings_Park","Bilston","Tettenhall","Wednesbury","Fire_engine","Dennis_Sabre","Dennis_Specialist_Vehicles","2010_Haiti_earthquake","Fire_service_in_the_United_Kingdom","West_Midlands_Police","West_Midlands_Ambulance_Service","West_Midlands_Search_and_Rescue"]}
