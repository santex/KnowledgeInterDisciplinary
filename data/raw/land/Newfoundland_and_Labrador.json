Situated in the country's Atlantic region, it incorporates\nthe island of Newfoundland and mainland Labrador to the northwest, with a\ncombined area of . As of 2011, the province's population is 514,536. Approximately 94 percent of the province's population\nresides on the Island of Newfoundland (including its associated smaller\nislands), of which more than half live on the Avalon Peninsula. The province is\nCanada's most linguistically homogenous, and 97.6% of residents reported English\n(Newfoundland English) as their mother tongue in the 2006 census;. http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-\n555/T401-eng.cfm Historically, Newfoundland was also home to unique\nvarieties of French, and Irish, as well as the now-extinct Beothuk language. In\nLabrador, local dialects of Innu-aimun and Inuktitut are also spoken.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador's capital and largest city, St. John's, is Canada's\n20th-largest Census Metropolitan Area, and is home to almost 40 percent of the\nprovince's population. St. John's is the seat of government, home to the House\nof Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador and the highest court in the\njurisdiction, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal.\n\nA former colony and dominion of the United Kingdom, Newfoundland and Labrador\nbecame the tenth province to enter the Canadian Confederation on March 31, 1949,\nas 'Newfoundland'. On December 6, 2001, an amendment was made to the\nConstitution of Canada to change the province's official name to Newfoundland\nand Labrador. In day-to-day conversation, however, Canadians\ngenerally still refer to the province itself as Newfoundland and to the region\non the Canadian mainland as Labrador.\n","linknr":1584,"url":"Newfoundland_and_Labrador","recorded":1362486255,"links":165,"instances":["governor","voting","oil_field","oil_field","1710","oil_field","1783","island","painter","politician","newfoundland_and_labrador","food","1754"],"pdf":["http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/91-214-x/91-214-x2008000-eng.pdf","http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/91-214-x/91-214-x2008000-eng.pdf","http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/pdf2011/TheEconomicReview2011.pdf","http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/pdf2011/TheEconomicReview2011.pdf","http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/ER2010/TheEconomicReview2010.pdf","http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/ER2010/TheEconomicReview2010.pdf","http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/publctn/gp-pg/ppc-chp/ppc-chp-eng.pdf","http://www.pch.gc.ca/pc-ch/publctn/gp-pg/ppc-chp/ppc-chp-eng.pdf","http://www.economics.gov.nl.ca/ER2010/TheEconomicReview2010.pdf"],"categories":["Newfoundland
