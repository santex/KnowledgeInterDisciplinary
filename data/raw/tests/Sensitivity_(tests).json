{"cursor":"13715","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Sensitivity' and 'specificity' are statistical measures of the performance of a\nbinary classification test, also known in statistics as classification function.\n'Sensitivity' (also called the true positive rate, or the '''recall rate''' in\nsome fields) measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly\nidentified as such (e.g. the percentage of sick people who are correctly\nidentified as having the condition). 'Specificity' measures the proportion of\nnegatives which are correctly identified as such (e.g. the percentage of healthy\npeople who are correctly identified as not having the condition, sometimes\ncalled the true negative rate). These two measures are closely related to the\nconcepts of type I and type II errors. A perfect predictor would be described as\n100% sensitive (i.e. predicting all people from the sick group as sick) and 100%\nspecific (i.e. not predicting anyone from the healthy group as sick); however,\ntheoretically any predictor will possess a minimum error bound known as the\nBayes error rate.\n\nFor any test, there is usually a trade-off between the measures. For example: in\nan airport security setting in which one is testing for potential threats to\nsafety, scanners may be set to trigger on low-risk items like belt buckles and\nkeys (low specificity), in order to reduce the risk of missing objects that do\npose a threat to the aircraft and those aboard (high sensitivity). This trade-\noff can be represented graphically as a receiver operating characteristic curve.\n","linknr":337,"url":"Sensitivity_(tests)","recorded":1362480342,"links":38,"instances":["test","classification_context","information_retrieval","tests"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical theory","Biostatistics","Medical statistics","Statistical ratios","Bioinformatics","Cheminformatics","Summary statistics for contingency tables"],"headings":["Definitions","Medical examples","Worked example","Estimation of errors in quoted sensitivity or specificity","Terminology in information retrieval","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/8/b/18b9c2c365f5f031143d310c9834755b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/8/5/a85720f465b9dcbefc9afc78aff3c9de.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/HighSensitivity_LowSpecificity_1401x1050.png/420px-HighSensitivity_LowSpecificity_1401x1050.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/LowSensitivity_HighSpecificity_1400x1050.png/420px-LowSensitivity_HighSpecificity_1400x1050.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/2/3/f238379cef5ce35ee24909b0f061fbbb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/6/1a696fcbcd3c51ddb4ec33152b4d4045.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/6/6/2666a86f6df34d6e8234e063e5e94f0e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/c/9/0c95c1d7a51d732d401f0bfac6b6e39b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/f/76f998543b2d48478e3bc7d234551f88.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/c/9/1c913113aeab0524f5026f61458c92bd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/2/b/72bb88380b5fde05a7480e91466e3706.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/9/9/a995a9186773b2b09224dea326d9f884.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/3/0735e03c4fcf423b88eb90f6fe7d40d2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/44px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precision_and_recall#definition","classification_context"],["precision_and_recall#definition","classification_context"],["precision_and_recall#definition","classification_context"],["sensitivity","test"],["specificity","tests"],["gain","information_retrieval"]],"members":["sensitivity","gain","specificity"],"related":["Binary_classification","Classification_rule","Statistical_classification","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Error_bound","Bayes_error_rate","Airport_security","Receiver_operating_characteristic","Precision_and_recall","Positive_predictive_value","Precision_and_recall","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Erythema_chronicum_migrans","Lyme_disease","Hereditary_colon_cancer","Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval","Confidence_intervals","Information_retrieval","F-score","Harmonic_mean","Statistical_hypothesis_testing","Statistical_power","Type_I_and_type_II_errors","Confusion_matrix","False_alarm","Type_I_error","Type_II_error","Sensitivity_(test)","Hit_rate","Accuracy","Specificity_(tests)","Positive_predictive_value","Negative_predictive_value","False_discovery_rate","Matthews_correlation_coefficient","Accuracy_and_precision","Brier_score","Confusion_matrix","Detection_theory","F-score","Gain_(information_retrieval)","Likelihood_ratios_in_diagnostic_testing","Matthews_correlation_coefficient","Receiver_operating_characteristic","Selectivity","Sensitivity_index","Statistical_significance","Youden's_J_statistic","OpenEpi"]}
