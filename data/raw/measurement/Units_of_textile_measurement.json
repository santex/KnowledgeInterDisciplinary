{"cursor":"16747","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Textile yarns are measured in various units, such as: the denier and tex (linear\nmass density of fibres), super S (fineness of wool fiber), worsted count, woolen\ncount, cotton count (or Number English Ne), Number metric (Nm) and yield (the\ninverse of denier and tex). Yarn is spun thread used for knitting, weaving, or\nsewing. Thread is a long, thin strand of cotton, nylon, or other fibers used in\nsewing or weaving. Both yarn and thread are measured in terms of cotton count\nand yarn density. Fabric is cloth, typically produced by weaving or knitting\ntextile fibers, and is measured in units such as mommes (momme is a number that\nequals the weight in pounds of a piece of silk if it were sized 45 inches by 100\nyards), thread count (a measure of the coarseness or fineness of fabric), ends\nper inch (e.p.i), and picks per inch (p.p.i).\n","linknr":305,"url":"Units_of_textile_measurement","recorded":1362904074,"links":36,"instances":["weaving","mass","fabric","unit","fabric","weaving"],"pdf":["http://www.nationaltextile.org/library/ftc/thread_count.pdf"],"categories":["Units of density","Textiles"],"headings":["Fiber/Fibre","Yarn and thread","Fabric","References","Bibliography","External links","",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/d/7ed760a9abc8cbe406b5f297e357c3cf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/f/f7f177957cf064a93e9811df8fe65ed1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Thread2.jpg/180px-Thread2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/7/8/5785a551123c7d08a3c50579a9f0cef4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/7/f/f7f177957cf064a93e9811df8fe65ed1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/COLLECTIE_TROPENMUSEUM_Garenspinnerij_TMnr_20018521.jpg/180px-COLLECTIE_TROPENMUSEUM_Garenspinnerij_TMnr_20018521.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/TwistPerInch2.jpg/220px-TwistPerInch2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Alpackaull.jpg/110px-Alpackaull.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tex","unit"],["pound","mass"],["chiffon","fabric"],["warp","weaving"],["warp","weaving"],["reed","weaving"],["reed","weaving"],["shrinkage","fabric"]],"members":["warp","pound","chiffon","tex","shrinkage","reed"],"related":["Denier","Linear_mass_density","Fibers","Mass","Gram","Meters","French_denier","Yarn","International_System_of_Units","Tex_(unit)","Agglomeration","Microfiber","Polyester","Diameter","Tights","Pantyhose","Continental_Europe","Deci","Super_S_or_S_number","Spinning_count","Worsted","Linear_density","Roving","Linear_density","Cotton","Surface_density","Silk","Pound_(mass)","Inch","Yard","Habutai","Chiffon_(fabric)","Crepe_de_Chine","Gauze","Raw_silk","Organza","Charmeuse","Threads_per_inch","Warp_(weaving)","Weft","Linen","Bed_sheet","Percale","Plying","National_Textile_Association","ASTM_International","Federal_Trade_Commission","Warp_(weaving)","Reed_(weaving)","Weaving","Plain_weave","Reed_(weaving)","Shrinkage_(fabric)","Weft"]}
