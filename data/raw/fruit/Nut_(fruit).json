{"cursor":"13599","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Nut}}\n\ns from the Common Hazel]]\ns]] , left, and its seed, right, having been removed from its pericarp.]] Museum\n  in Himachal Pradesh, India.]] A 'nut' is a fruit composed of a hard shell and\n  a seed, where the hard-shelled fruit does not open to release the seed\n  (indehiscent). So, while, in a culinary context, a wide variety of dried seeds\n  are often called nuts, in a botanical context, only ones that include the\n  indehiscent fruit are considered true nuts. The translation of \"nut\" in\n  certain languages frequently requires paraphrases as the concept is ambiguous.\n\nMost seeds come from fruits that naturally free themselves from the shell,\nunlike nuts such as hazelnuts, chestnuts, and acorns, which have hard shell\nwalls and originate from a compound ovary. Culinary usage of the term is less\nrestrictive, and some nuts as defined in food preparation, like pistachios and\nBrazil nuts, are not\nnuts in a botanical sense. Common usage of the term often refers to any hard-\nwalled, edible kernel as a nut.\n","linknr":493,"url":"Nut_(fruit)","recorded":1362483726,"links":94,"instances":["fruit","plants","biology","disambiguation","tree","plant"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Fruit morphology","Edible nuts and seeds","Snack foods","Vegan cuisine","Vegetarian cuisine","Christmas food","Staple foods"],"headings":["Botanical definition","Culinary definition and uses","Nutritional benefits","Other uses","Historical usage","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Hazelnuts.jpg/220px-Hazelnuts.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Chestnut.jpg/220px-Chestnut.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/W_Nuss_Gr_99.jpg/220px-W_Nuss_Gr_99.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/A_nut_cutter.JPG/220px-A_nut_cutter.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/KoreanPineSeeds.jpg/220px-KoreanPineSeeds.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Nuts_and_seeds_%28996x563%29.PNG/300px-Nuts_and_seeds_%28996x563%29.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Foods.jpg/19px-Foods.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg/40px-Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ovary","plants"],["order","biology"],["wingnut","plant"],["capsule","fruit"],["capsule","fruit"],["horse-chestnut","tree"],["nucifera","disambiguation"]],"members":["capsule","ovary","order","nucifera","wingnut"],"related":["Common_Hazel","Indehiscent","Indehiscent","Hazelnut","Chestnut","Acorn","Pistachio","Brazil_nut","Botany","Fruit","Seed","Ovary_(plants)","Carpel","Flower","Order_(biology)","Fagales","Juglandaceae","Walnut","Hickory","Pecan","Wingnut_(plant)","Fagaceae","Beech","Chestnut","Oak","Lithocarpus","Tanoak","Betulaceae","Hazel","Corylus_maxima","Hornbeam","Botany","Pyrena","Seed","Drupe","Cuisine","Seed","Snack_food","Cookery","Cosmetics","Jay","Squirrel","Acorn","Food_allergy","Almond","Drupe","Brazil_nut","Capsule_(fruit)","Candlenut","Cashew","Chilean_hazelnut","Aesculus","Capsule_(fruit)","Macadamia","Pachira_aquatica","Mongongo","Peanut","Legume","Fabaceae","Pine_nut","Pine","Pinophyta","Pistachio","Epidemiological","Coronary_heart_disease","Clinical_trial","Almond","Walnut","LDL","Fatty_acid","Hypolipidemic","Glycemic_index","Insulin_resistance","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Junk_food","Essential_fatty_acids","Unsaturated_fats","Monounsaturated_fats","Arginine","Antioxidants","Horse-chestnut_(tree)","British_Isles","Glucoside","Aesculin","Slingshot","Almond","Euryale_ferox","Acorns","Pistachio","Water_chestnut","Hominins","Pleistocene","Native_Americans_in_the_United_States","California","List_of_edible_seeds","Nucifera_(disambiguation)"]}
