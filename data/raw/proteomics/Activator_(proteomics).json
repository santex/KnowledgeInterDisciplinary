They are the opposite of enzyme inhibitors.\nThese molecules are often involved in the allosteric regulation of enzymes in\nthe control of metabolism. An example of an enzyme activator working in this way\nis fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which activates phosphofructokinase 1 and\nincreases the rate of glycolysis in response to the hormone\ninsulin.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Activator_(proteomics)","recorded":1362555073,"links":21,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Enzyme kinetics"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Phosphofructokinase_6PFK_wpmp.png/220px-Phosphofructokinase_6PFK_wpmp.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png/60px-PBB_GE_PNPLA6_203718_at_tn.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["effector","biology"]],"members":["effector"],"related":["Phosphofructokinase","Enzyme","Enzyme_inhibitor","Allosteric_regulation","Metabolism","Fructose_2,6-bisphosphate","Phosphofructokinase_1","Glycolysis","Insulin","Enzyme_inducer","Effector_(biology)"]}
