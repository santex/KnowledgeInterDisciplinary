{"cursor":"42157","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer networking, 'network address translation' ('NAT') is the process of\nmodifying IP address information in IP packet headers while in transit across a\ntraffic routing device.\n\nThe simplest type of NAT provides a one-to-one translation of IP addresses. RFC\n2663 refers to this type of NAT as 'basic NAT', which is often also called a 'one-to-\none NAT'. In this type of NAT only the IP addresses, IP header checksum and any\nhigher level checksums that include the IP address are changed. The rest of the\npacket is left untouched (at least for basic TCP/UDP functionality; some higher\nlevel protocols may need further translation). Basic NATs can be used to\ninterconnect two IP networks that have incompatible addressing.\n\nHowever, it is common to hide an entire IP address space, usually consisting of\nprivate IP addresses, behind a single IP address (or in some cases a small group\nof IP addresses) in another (usually public) address space. To avoid ambiguity\nin the handling of returned packets, a one-to-many NAT must alter higher level\ninformation such as TCP/UDP ports in outgoing communications and must maintain a\ntranslation table so that return packets can be correctly translated back. RFC\n2663 uses the term 'NAPT' ('network address and port translation') for this type\nof NAT. Other names include 'PAT' ('port address translation'), 'IP\nmasquerading', 'NAT Overload' and 'many-to-one NAT'. Since this is the most\ncommon type of NAT it is often referred to simply as NAT.\n\nAs described, the method enables communication through the router only when the\nconversation originates in the masqueraded network, since this establishes the\ntranslation tables. For example, a web browser in the masqueraded network can\nbrowse a website outside, but a web browser outside could not browse a web site\nin the masqueraded network. However, most NAT devices today allow the network\nadministrator to configure translation table entries for permanent use. This\nfeature is often referred to as \"static NAT\" or port forwarding and allows\ntraffic originating in the \"outside\" network to reach designated hosts in the\nmasqueraded network.\n\nIn the mid-1990s NAT became a popular tool for alleviating the consequences of\nIPv4 address exhaustion. [http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPNetworkAddre-\nssTranslationNATProtocol.htm\nwww.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPNetworkAddressTranslationNATProtocol.htm] It\nhas become a common, indispensable feature in routers for home and small-\noffice Internet connections. Most systems using NAT do so in order to enable\nmultiple hosts on a private network to access the Internet using a single\npublic IP address.\n\nNetwork address translation has serious drawbacks in terms of the quality of\nInternet connectivity and requires careful attention to the details of its\nimplementation. In particular, all types of NAT break the originally envisioned\nmodel of IP end-to-end connectivity across the Internet and NAPT makes it\ndifficult for systems behind a NAT to accept incoming communications. As a\nresult, NAT traversal methods have been devised to alleviate the issues\nencountered.\n","linknr":381,"url":"Network_address_translation","recorded":1362539257,"links":54,"instances":["information_technology","telecommunications","firewall","computing","network","computing","computing","networking","computing","computer_software"],"pdf":["http://www.tieline.com/Downloads/Audio-over-IP-Instant-Expert-Guide-v1.pdf","http://www.tieline.com/Downloads/Audio-over-IP-Instant-Expert-Guide-v1.pdf","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel4/6056/16183/00749275.pdf"],"categories":["Network address translation|*","Internet architecture"],"headings":["One-to-many NATs","Implementation","NAT and TCP/UDP","DNAT","SNAT","Dynamic network address translation","NAT loopback","Applications affected by NAT","Advantages of PAT","Drawbacks","Specifications","Examples of NAT software","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Full_Cone_NAT.svg/400px-Full_Cone_NAT.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Restricted_Cone_NAT.svg/400px-Restricted_Cone_NAT.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Port_Restricted_Cone_NAT.svg/400px-Port_Restricted_Cone_NAT.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Symmetric_NAT.svg/400px-Symmetric_NAT.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["router","computing"],["router","computing"],["host","network"],["server","computing"],["daemon","computer_software"],["packet","information_technology"],["router","computing"],["dmz","computing"],["packet","information_technology"],["router","computing"],["firewall","networking"],["wingate","computing"],["pf","firewall"],["firewall","networking"],["gateway","telecommunications"]],"members":["packet","gateway","pf","wingate","host","router","dmz","firewall","server","daemon"],"related":["Computer_network","IP_address","IPv4_header","Router_(computing)","Checksum","Transmission_Control_Protocol","User_Datagram_Protocol","Private_IP_address","Web_browser","Port_forwarding","IPv4_address_exhaustion","Router_(computing)","Host_(network)","Private_network","Internet","End-to-end_connectivity","NAT_traversal","Private_network","Internet_service_provider","Internet_Control_Message_Protocol","Simple_traversal_of_UDP_over_NATs","IETF","Port_forwarding","TCP_hole_punching","NAT_traversal","Ephemeral_ports","Peer-to-peer","IP_address","Internet_socket","Server_(computing)","SMTP","Daemon_(computer_software)","IPv4","Internet_Control_Message_Protocol","Transmission_Control_Protocol","User_Datagram_Protocol","Maximum_transmission_unit","Path_MTU_Discovery","DNAT","IP_address","Packet_(information_technology)","Router_(computing)","IP_address","Port_forwarding","DMZ_(computing)","Demilitarised_zone","ISA_Server","ISA_Server","Secure_Network_Address_Translation","Computer_network","IP_address","Internet_Protocol","Packet_(information_technology)","Router_(computing)","Firewall_(networking)","NAT_loopback","NAT_reflection","NAT_hairpinning","Wide_area_network","Default_gateway","Hosts_file","LAND","IP_subnet","Application_Layer","File_Transfer_Protocol","Session_Initiation_Protocol","File_Transfer_Protocol","Session_Initiation_Protocol","Voice_over_IP","Real-time_Transport_Protocol","STUN","Application_Layer_Gateway","NAT_traversal","STUN","Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment","Session_Border_Controller","UDP_hole_punching","Universal_Plug_and_Play","NAT-PMP","SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol","IPsec","Session_Initiation_Protocol","Transport_Layer_Security","ISO/OSI_Reference_Model","User_Datagram_Protocol","TISPAN","Dan_Kaminsky","Cache_poisoning","IPv4_address_exhaustion","IPv6","End-to-end_connectivity","Transmission_Control_Protocol","User_Datagram_Protocol","File_Transfer_Protocol","Application-level_gateway","Tunneling_protocol","IPsec","IPsec","Internet_Architecture_Board","Keepalive","Internet_service_provider","India","Russia","Asia","Internet_Architecture_Board","HTTP","VOIP","Videoconferencing","NAT_traversal","IEEE","IETF","Cisco","Mapping_of_Address_and_Port","A+P","IPv6","Stateless_protocol","Carrier_Grade_NAT","DS_Lite","Customer_premises_equipment","NAT444","IPv6","3COM","Internet_Connection_Sharing","WinGate_(computing)","Iptables","IPFilter","PF_(firewall)","Netfilter","AYIYA","Carrier-grade_NAT","Firewall_(networking)","Gateway_(telecommunications)","Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol","Middlebox","IPv4","Port_forwarding","Port_triggering","Private_IP_address","Proxy_server","Routing","Subnetwork","TCP_and_UDP_port","Teredo_tunneling"]}
