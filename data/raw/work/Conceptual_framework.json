For example,\nthe philosopher Isaiah Berlin used the \"hedgehogs\" versus \"foxes\"\napproach; Michiko Kakutani (Tuesday, April 28,\n2009)\"[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/books/28kaku.html?pagewanted=all The\nEra of Adapting Quickly]\", The [[New York Times]]  a \"hedgehog\" might\napproach the world in terms of a single organizing principle; a \"fox\" might\npursue multiple conflicting goals simultaneously.\n\nConceptual frameworks (theoretical frameworks) are a type of intermediate\ntheory that attempt to connect to all aspects of inquiry (e.g., problem\ndefinition, purpose, literature review, methodology, data collection and\nanalysis). Conceptual frameworks can act like maps that give coherence to\nempirical inquiry. Because conceptual frameworks are potentially so close to\nempirical inquiry, they take different forms depending upon the research\nquestion or problem.\n\nSeveral types of conceptual frameworks have been identified, Patricia M.\nShields and Hassan Tajalli (2006), \"Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in\nSuccessful Student Scholarship,\" Journal of Public Affairs Education 12(3): 313-\n334. https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3967 Patricia M.\nShields (1998). \"Pragmatism as a Philosophy of Science:A Tool for Public\nAdministration,\" Research in Public Administration. Volume 4: 195-225.\nhttps://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3954 such as\n\n* Working hypothesis\n* Descriptive Categories\n* Practical ideal types\n* Models of operations research\n* Formal hypotheses\n\nThese are linked to particular research purposes such as: Examples:\n[https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/105 Applied Research Projects\nat Texas State University - San Marcos]\n* Exploration or Exploratory research\n* Description or Descriptive research\n* Gauging\n* Decision making\n* Explanation\n* Prediction\n\nProponents claim that when purpose and framework are aligned, other aspects of\nempirical research such as methodological choices and statistical techniques\nbecome simpler to identify.\n\nFrameworks have also been used to explain conflict theory and the balance\nnecessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks,\nvisible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries\nform and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom)\nare mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks,\nstasis, evolution and revolution.  Anomalies may exist without\nadequate \"lenses\" or \"filters\" to see them and may become visible only when the\ntools exist to define them. Thomas Kuhn.
