The definition of a node depends on the network and protocol layer\nreferred to. A physical network node is an active electronic device that is\nattached to a network, and is capable of sending, receiving, or forwarding\ninformation over a communications channel. A passive distribution\npoint such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.\n\nIn network theory or graph theory, the term node refers to a point in a network\ntopology at which lines intersect or\nbranch.
