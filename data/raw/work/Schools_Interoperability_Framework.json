Until recently, it has been used\nprimarily in the United States alone; however, it is increasingly being\nimplemented in Australia, the UK, India and elsewhere.\n\nThe specification is composed of two parts: an XML specification for modeling\neducational data, and a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) specification for\nsharing that data between institutions.\n\nSIF is not a product, but an industry initiative that enables diverse\napplications to interact and share data. As of March 2007, SIF is estimated to\nhave been used in more than 48 states and 6 countries, supporting five million\nstudents.
