{"cursor":"7559","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Business networking' is a socioeconomic activity by which groups of like-minded\nbusinesspeople recognize, create, or act upon business opportunities. A business\nnetwork is a type of social network whose reason for existing is business\nactivity. There are several prominent business networking organizations that\ncreate models of networking activity that, when followed, allow the business\nperson to build new business relationships and generate business opportunities\nat the same time. A professional network service is an implementation of\ninformation technology in support of business networking. Many businesspeople\ncontend business networking is a more cost-effective method of generating new\nbusiness than advertising or public relations efforts. This is because business\nnetworking is a low-cost activity that involves more personal commitment than\ncompany money.\n\nAs an example, a business network may agree to meet weekly or monthly with the\npurpose of exchanging business leads and referrals with fellow members. To\ncomplement this activity, members often meet outside this circle, on their own\ntime, and build their own one-to-one relationship with the fellow member.\n\nBusiness networking can be conducted in a local business community, or on a\nlarger scale via the Internet. Business networking websites have grown over\nrecent years due to the Internet's ability to connect people from all over the\nworld. Internet companies often set up business leads for sale to bigger\ncorporations and companies looking for data sources.\n\nBusiness networking can have a meaning also in the ICT domain, i.e. the\nprovision of operating support to companies and organizations, and related value\nchains and value networks.\n\nIt refers to an activity coordination with a wider scope and a simpler\nimplementation than pre-organized workflows or web-based impromptu searches for\ntransaction counterparts (workflow is useful to coordinate activities, but it is\ncomplicated by the use of s.c. patterns to deviate the flow of work from a pure\nsequence, in order to compensate its intrinsic linearity; impromptu searches for\ntransaction counterparts on the web are useful as well, but only for non-\nstrategic supplies; both are complicated by a plethora of interfaces needed\namong different organizations and even between different IT applications within\nthe same organization).\n","linknr":154,"url":"Business_networking","recorded":1363388986,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Network_marketing","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations","/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check","/wiki/Socioeconomic","/wiki/Businesspeople","/wiki/Social_network","/wiki/Professional_network_service","/wiki/Information_technology","/wiki/Cost-effective","/wiki/Advertising","/wiki/Public_relations","/wiki/Referral_marketing","/wiki/Internet","/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology","/wiki/Value_chain","/wiki/Value_network","/wiki/Web_search","/wiki/Information_technology","#Large_firms_networks_vs._small_business_networks","#Online_business_networking","#Face-to-face_business_networking","#General_business_networking","#Networked_Businesses","#Business_networking_in_the_ICT_domain","#See_also","#References","#External_links","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Bulk_buying","/wiki/Financial_quote","/wiki/Retail_price","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/Business_partner","/wiki/Global_economy","/wiki/Social_network","/wiki/E-commerce","/wiki/Globalization","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=3","/wiki/Interpersonal_communication","/wiki/Face_time","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=4","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Distribution_(business)","/wiki/Social_stratification","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Value_chain","/wiki/IT_support","/wiki/Software_application","/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning","/wiki/Workflows","/wiki/Computer_data_storage","/wiki/Digital_signature","/wiki/Decryption","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/Professional_network_service","/wiki/Personal_Network","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=8","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit&section=9","http://edition.cnn.com/2010/BUSINESS/04/08/social.media.small.biz/index.html","http://books.google.es/books?id=KhbDsM3ld_cC","/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number","/wiki/Special:BookSources/3-540-41351-0,_9783540413516","http://books.google.es/books?id=KhbDsM3ld_cC","/wiki/Template:Business_organizations","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Business_organizations&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Business_organizations&action=edit","/wiki/Employers%27_organization","/wiki/Chamber_of_commerce","/wiki/Trade_association","/wiki/Cooperative_federation","/wiki/Zaibatsu","/wiki/Keiretsu","/wiki/Chaebol","/wiki/Trade_union","/wiki/Consumer_organization","/wiki/Cartel","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&oldid=541480856","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Business_models","/wiki/Category:Business_terms","/wiki/Category:Professional_networks","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_in-text_citations_from_August_2012","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_in-text_citations","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Business+networking&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Business+networking","/wiki/Business_networking","/wiki/Talk:Business_networking","#","/wiki/Business_networking","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Business_networking&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:Re
