(2000). \"Cultivation Revisited: Some Genres\nHave Some Effects on Some Viewers\". Communication Reports, 13(2), 99.\n\nDeveloped by George Gerbner and Larry Gross of the University of Pennsylvania,\ncultivation theory derived from several large-scale research projects as part of\nan overall research project entitled 'Cultural Indicators'. The purpose of the\nCultural Indicators project was to identify and track the 'cultivated' effects\nof television on viewers. They were \"concerned with the effects of television\nprogramming (particularly violent programming) on the attitudes and behaviors of\nthe American public.\" Miller, K. (2005). Communications\ntheories: Perspectives, processes, and contexts. New York: McGraw-Hill.\nGerbner asserts that the overall concern about the effects of television on\naudiences stemmed from the unprecedented centrality of television in American\nculture. \"The theory clearly posits that the cultivation effect occurs only\nafter long-term, cumulative exposure to television. \" Cohen, J. & Weimann, G. (2000). \"Cultivation Revisited: Some Genres\nHave Some Effects on Some Viewers\" Communication Reports, 13(2), 99. He\nclaimed that because TV contains so much violence, people who spend the most\ntime in front of the tube develop an exaggerated belief in a mean and scary\nworld. \" Griffin, E. (2012). Communication Communication\nCommunication. McGraw-Hill: New York, (8), 366-377. He posited that\ntelevision as a mass medium of communication had formed in to a common symbolic\nenvironment that bound diverse communities together, socializing people in to\nstandardized roles and behaviors. \"Today, the TV set is a key member of the\nhousehold, with virtually unlimited access to every person in the family.\" Griffin, E. (2012). Communication Communication Communication.\nMcGraw-Hill: New York, (8), 366-377. He compared the power of television\nto the power of religion, saying that television was to modern society what\nreligion once was in earlier times.\n\nCultivation Analysis is a positivistic theory, meaning it assumes the existence\nof objective reality and value-neutral research. West, Richard &\nTurner, Lynn (2010).Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application.\n(Fourth Edition). McGraw Hill. A study conducted by Jennings Bryant and\nDorina Miron (2004), which surveyed almost 2,000 articles published in the three\ntop mass communication journals since 1956, found that Cultivation Analysis was\nthe third most frequently utilized theory, showing that it continues to be one\nof the most popular theories in mass communication research.
