{"cursor":"12435","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Value theory' encompasses a range of approaches to understanding how, why and\nto what degree people value things; whether the thing is a person, idea, object,\nor anything else. This investigation began in ancient philosophy, where it is\ncalled axiology or ethics. Early philosophical investigations sought to\nunderstand good and evil and the concept of \"the good\". Today much of value\ntheory is scientifically empirical, recording what people do value and\nattempting to understand why they value it in the context of psychology,\nsociology, and economics. \n\nAt the general level, there is a difference between moral and natural goods.\nMoral goods are those that have to do with the conduct of persons, usually\nleading to praise or blame. Natural goods, on the other hand, have to do with\nobjects, not persons. For example, to say that \"Mary is a morally good person\"\nmight involve a different sense of \"good\" than the one used in the sentence\n\"Wow, that was some good food\".\n\nEthics tend to be focused on moral goods rather than natural goods, while\neconomics tends to be interested in the opposite. However, both moral and\nnatural goods are equally relevant to goodness and value theory, which is more\ngeneral in scope.\n","linknr":198,"url":"Goodness_and_value_theory","recorded":1362373709,"links":17,"instances":["ethics","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Value","Axiological theories"],"headings":["Sociology","Economics","Ethics and Axiology","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties","philosophy"],["relative_value","philosophy"],["intrinsic_value","ethics"],["absolute_value","philosophy"],["relative_value","philosophy"]],"members":["intrinsic_value","absolute_value","relative_value","intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties"],"related":["Philosophy","Axiology","Ethics","Good_and_evil","Science","Empirical","Psychology","Sociology","Economics","Sociology","Max_Weber","Émile_Durkheim","Talcott_Parsons","Jürgen_Habermas","Historical_institutionalism","Historical_materialism","Behaviorism","Postmodern_philosophy","Revealed_preference","Economic_value","Consensus","Exchange_value","Service_economy","Substance_use_disorder","Economic_growth","Cigarette","Tobacco","Lung_cancer","Public_good","Suicide","Make-work_job","Ecological_Economics","Marx","Labour_Theory_of_Value","Emergy","Ethics","Plato","Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties_(philosophy)","Environmental_ethics","Aldo_Leopold","Holmes_Rolston_III","John_McMurtry","UNESCO","John_Dewey","Ethic_valuation","Relative_value_(philosophy)","Intrinsic_value_(ethics)","Absolute_intrinsic_value_denial","Contributory_conditionality","Moral_philosophy","Absolute_value_(philosophy)","Relative_value_(philosophy)","Intrinsic_good","Categorical_Imperative","Ethic_of_Reciprocity","Golden_Rule","Axiology","Cultural_Institutions_Studies","Graded_absolutism","Intuitionism","Labor_theory_of_value","Law_of_value","Morality","Friedrich_Nietzsche","Normative_science","Aesthetics","Ethics","Logic","Pirsig's_metaphysics_of_Quality","Rationality","Rationality_and_power","Summum_bonum","Ultimate_importance","Value-added_theory","Anthropological_theories_of_value"]}
