{"cursor":"4269","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, 'duality' is a correspondence\nbetween properties of a category C and so-called 'dual properties' of the\nopposite category C op . Given a statement regarding the category C, by\ninterchanging the source and target of each morphism as well as interchanging\nthe order of composing two morphisms, a corresponding dual statement is obtained\nregarding the opposite category C op . 'Duality', as such, is the\nassertion that truth is invariant under this operation on statements. In other\nwords, if a statement is true about C, then its dual statement is true about\nC op . Also, if a statement is false about C, then its dual has to be\nfalse about C op .\n\nGiven a concrete category C, it is often the case that the opposite category\nC op per se is abstract. C op need not be a category that\narises from mathematical practice. In this case, another category D is also\ntermed to be in 'duality' with C if D and C op are equivalent as\ncategories.\n\nIn the case when C and its opposite C op are equivalent, such a\ncategory is 'self-dual'.\n","linknr":132,"url":"Dual_(category_theory)","recorded":1362896912,"links":14,"instances":["category_theory","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Category theory","Duality theories|Category theory"],"headings":["Formal definition","Examples","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/a/a5a0406f40aa56d878c3c55c0f019d58.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/d/9dd6c05179403906880d2c028164cea8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/3/f/43f68a3b14cad7fc8e9f51efbf05ab72.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/4/6/b46b1562fd94ed61ac8bf3b19a876370.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/7/5/875b6a81670f5847f434c2c1cb3b4c94.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/7/b/a7be33c9699b7c86ffe5b4f779a3b4a5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/9/0/19070998a9b4872fdcaf8c07ec04e5ab.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/a/3/4a331f169bcd7cbce63862ea60d9f9b8.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["duality","order_theory"],["limit","category_theory"],["limit","category_theory"],["duality","mathematics"]],"members":["limit","duality","set"],"related":["Category_theory","Mathematics","Opposite_category","Morphism","Concrete_category","Equivalence_of_categories","First_order_language","Morphism","Function_composition","Monomorphism","Epimorphism","Partial_order","Set_(mathematics)","Lattice_theory","De_Morgan's_laws","Duality_(order_theory)","Limit_(category_theory)","Limit_(category_theory)","Fibration","Cofibration","Algebraic_topology","Homotopy_theory","Eckmannâ€“Hilton_duality","Dual_object","Duality_(mathematics)","Opposite_category"]}
