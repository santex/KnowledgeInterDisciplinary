Other terms used for the line graph include the\n'theta-obrazom', the 'covering graph', the 'derivative', the 'edge-to-vertex\ndual', the 'conjugate', and the 'representative graph' , as well as the\n'edge graph', the 'interchange graph', the 'adjoint graph', and the 'derived\ngraph' .\n\nOne of the earliest and most important theorems about line graphs is due to ,\nwho proved that with one exceptional case the structure of G can be recovered\ncompletely from its line graph. In other words, with that one exception, the\nentire graph can be deduced from knowing the adjacencies of edges (\"lines\").\n","linknr":265,"url":"Conjugate_(graph_theory)","recorded":1362565167,"links":25,"instances":["graph_theory","graph_theory","graph_theory","graph_theory","graph_theory","geometry","graph_theory","graph_theory","graph_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Graph families","Intersection classes of graphs","Graph operations"],"headings":["Formal definition","Examples","Properties","Characterization and recognition","Iterating the line graph operator","Relations to other families of graphs","Generalizations","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Line_graph_construction_1.svg/135px-Line_graph_construction_1.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Line_graph_construction_2.svg/135px-Line_graph_construction_2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Line_graph_construction_3.svg/135px-Line_graph_construction_3.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Line_graph_construction_4.svg/128px-Line_graph_construction_4.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Forbidden_line_subgraphs.svg/300px-Forbidden_line_subgraphs.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/e/c/7ec67670185195b16820829b113d8830.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/b/e9bbcb5bf88882f3425307e40ae827df.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/LineGraphExampleA.svg/100px-LineGraphExampleA.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/6/d/e6d586f8474f6ca38436c11ed9be85e6.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["edge","graph_theory"],["vertex","graph_theory"],["rectification","geometry"],["clique","graph_theory"],["matching","graph_theory"],["independent_set","graph_theory"],["path","graph_theory"],["tree","graph_theory"],["clique","graph_theory"],["könig's_theorem","graph_theory"]],"members":["clique","tree","path","independent_set","matching","rectification","edge","vertex"],"related":["Mathematics","Graph_theory","Undirected_graph","Edge_(graph_theory)","Vertex_(graph_theory)","Adjacent","Intersection_graph","Spectral_graph_theory","Two-graph","Cubic_graph","Polyhedra","Tetrahedron","Octahedron","Cube","Cuboctahedron","Dodecahedron","Icosidodecahedron","Rectification_(geometry)","Clique_(graph_theory)","Icosahedron","Matching_(graph_theory)","Independent_set_(graph_theory)","Connected_graph","Path_(graph_theory)","Maximum_independent_set_problem","Maximum_matching","Edge_chromatic_number","Vertex_chromatic_number","Edge-transitive_graph","Vertex-transitive_graph","Euler_cycle","Hamiltonian_graph","Claw-free_graph","Induced_subgraph","Tree_(graph_theory)","Block_graph","Clique_(graph_theory)","Graph_isomorphism","Induced_subgraph","Complete_bipartite_graph","Line_graphs_of_hypergraphs","Connected_graph","Cycle_graph","Graph_isomorphism","Path_graph","Empty_graph","Claw-free_graph","Bipartite_graph","Perfect_graph","König's_theorem_(graph_theory)","Rook's_graph","Complete_bipartite_graph","Dipole_graph","Shannon_multigraph","De_Bruijn_graph","Complete_graph","Random_walk","Weighted_edges","Hypergraph","Family_of_sets","Line_graph_of_a_hypergraph","Intersection_graph","Rendiconti_del_Circolo_Matematico_di_Palermo"]}
