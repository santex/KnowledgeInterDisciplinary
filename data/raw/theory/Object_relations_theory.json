Based on psychodynamic theory, the theory object relations suggests\nthat people relate to others and situations in their adult lives as shaped by\nfamily experiences during infancy. For example, an adult who experienced neglect\nor abuse in infancy would expect similar behavior from others who remind them of\nthe neglectful or abusive person from their past (often a parent). These images\nof people and events turn into Objects in the subconscious that the person\ncarries into adulthood, and are used by the subconscious to predict people's\nbehavior in their social relationships and interactions.\n\nInternal objects are formed by the patterns emerging in one's repeated\nsubjective experience of the caretaking environment which may or may not be\naccurate representations of the actual, external others. In the theory, Objects\nare usually internalized images of one's mother, father, or primary caregiver,\nalthough they could also consist of parts of a person, for instance an infant\nrelating to the breast, or things in one's inner world (one's internalized image\nof others). Later experiences can reshape these early patterns, but\nObjects often continue to exert a strong influence throughout life. Greenberg, J. & Mitchell, S. (1983). Object Relations in\nPsychoanalytic Theory. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and\nLondon, England. Objects are initially comprehended in the infant mind by\ntheir functions and are termed \"part objects.\" The\nbreast that feeds the hungry infant is the \"good breast,\" while hungry infant\nthat finds no breast is in relation to the \"bad breast.\" With a \"good enough\" \"facilitating environment\" part object\nfunctions eventually transform into a comprehension of whole objects. This\ncorresponds with the ability to tolerate ambiguity, to see that both the \"good\"\nand the \"bad\" breast are a part of the same mother figure.\n\nOtto Rank, coiner of the term \"pre-Oedipal,\" was the first to create a modern\ntheory of \"object relations\" in the late 1920s. It was later independently\nformulated by Ronald Fairbairn in 1952, Fairbairn, W.R.D. (1952).\nPsychoanalytic Studies of the Personality. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul,\n1981. but the line of thought being referred to first emerged in 1917,\nbeginning with Ferenczi and, later, Rank. Ogden, T. (2005). This Art of\nPsychoanalysis: Dreaming undreamt dreams and interrupted cries. NY: Routledge.\n(p. 27). Although first formulated in the 1920s by Otto Rank, object\nrelations theory was extended in the 1940s and 50s by British psychologists\nRonald Fairbairn, Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, Harry Guntrip, Scott Stuart,\nand others.\n","linknr":418,"url":"Object_relations_theory","recorded":1362676442,"links":31,"instances":["psychodynamics","mythology","psychology","psychoanalysis","psychology","psychology","psychoanalysis"],"pdf":["http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/160/2/241.pdf"],"categories":["Freudian psychology","Psychoanalysis","Neopsychoanalytic schools","Psychological theories","History of mental health in the United Kingdom"],"headings":["History","Kleinian object relations theory","Continuing developments in the theory","See also","Notes","References and further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Freud-Museum.jpg/170px-Freud-Museum.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Amormaterno.png/70px-Amormaterno.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["psyche","psychology"],["british_independent_group","psychoanalysis"],["splitting","psychology"],["pleasure_principle","psychology"],["eros","mythology"],["jointness","psychodynamics"],["reparation","psychoanalysis"]],"members":["jointness","eros","splitting","british_independent_group","psyche","pleasure_principle","reparation"],"related":["Psychoanalytic_psychology","Psyche_(psychology)","Psychodynamics","Mother","Father","Breast","Infant","Otto_Rank","Ronald_Fairbairn","Ferenczi","Rank","Otto_Rank","Melanie_Klein","Donald_Winnicott","Harry_Guntrip","British_Independent_Group_(psychoanalysis)","Sigmund_Freud","Anna_Freud","Ego_psychology","Margaret_Mahler","Michael_Balint","Splitting_(psychology)","Hanna_Segal","Wilfred_Bion","Projective_identification","Introjection","Pleasure_principle_(psychology)","Reality_principle","Defense_mechanism","Wilfred_Bion","Thomas_Ogden","John_Steiner","James_Grotstein","Donald_Meltzer","Ester_Bick","Sigmund_Freud","Object_relation","Drive_theory","Melanie_Klein","Libido","Eros_(mythology)","Death","Thanatos","Love","Hate","Libido","Attachment_theory","John_Bowlby","Psychiatry","Psychotherapy","N._Gregory_Hamilton","Glen_O._Gabbard","Psychology","N._Gregory_Hamilton","Otto_F._Kernberg","Attachment_theory","Jointness_(psychodynamics)","Family_therapy","Psychoanalysis","Relational_psychoanalysis","Reparation_(psychoanalysis)","Transference_focused_psychotherapy","Unthought_known","Otto_Rank","Melanie_Klein","Joseph_J._Sandler","Ronald_Fairbairn","Donald_Winnicott","Wilfred_Bion","Ignacio_Matte_Blanco","John_Bowlby","James_F._Masterson"]}
