Fulfilling the burden of\nproof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of\nproof off to another party.\n","linknr":351,"url":"Legal_burden_of_proof","recorded":1362676871,"links":35,"instances":["law","law","philosophy","common_law","law"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Criminal law","Civil law (common law)","American legal terms","Evidence law","Legal doctrines and principles"],"headings":["Definition","Standard of proof: United States","Standard of proof: United Kingdom trials","Other standards for presenting cases or defenses","Examples","See also","References","Bibliography","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["maxim","philosophy"],["remedy","law"],["civil_law","common_law"],["equity","law"],["brocard","law"],["civil_law","common_law"]],"members":["remedy","equity","maxim","civil_law","brocard"],"related":["Maxim_(philosophy)","Presumption_of_innocence","Trier_of_fact","Presumption_of_innocence","Affirmative_defense","Evidential_burden","Affirmative_defenses","Probable_cause","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Grand_jury","Indictment","Remedy_(law)","Drug_Enforcement_Administration","Child_Protective_Services","Administrative_agencies","Standard_of_review","Social_Security_Disability_Insurance","Administrative_law_judge","Social_Security_Administration","United_States_Federal_courts","Exhaustion_of_remedies","Civil_law_(common_law)","Family_court","Child_support","Child_Support_Standards_Act","Probability","Tom_Denning,_Baron_Denning","United_States","Civil_procedure","Criminal_procedure","Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States","Equity_(law)","Paternity","PINS","Juvenile_delinquency","Child_custody","Probate","Living_wills","Life_support","Right_to_die","Air_of_reality","Canada","Affirmative_defense","Insanity_defense","Western_world","Criminal_law","Prosecutor","List_of_legal_Latin_terms","Brocard_(law)","Ei_incumbit_probatio_qui_dicit","Presumption_of_innocence","Jurisdiction","Witness","Forensic_evidence","Autopsy","England_and_Wales","Magistrates'_Courts_Act_1980","Drunk_in_charge","European_Convention_on_Human_Rights","Judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords","Civil_law_(common_law)","United_States_Supreme_Court","Philosophic_burden_of_proof","Probative","Rebuttable_presumption"]}
