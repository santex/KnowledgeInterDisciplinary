{"cursor":"1263","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":This article is about rot prevention. For other uses, see [[Rot\n(disambiguation)|Rot]].\n\n'Rot-proof' or 'rot resistant' is a condition of or , by a process or\ntreatment of materials used in industrial manufacturing or production to\nprevent biodegradation and chemical decomposition. Decomposition is a factor\nin which organic matter breaks down overtime. It is commonly caused by fungus,\nmold or mildew.\n\nThere are natural conditions where the environment is to animals, bacteria and\nfungus, for example in high altitude and the freezing subzero temperatures of\nthe Arctic and Antarctic, which creates a similar suspension. The proofing of\nmeterials may also prevent dry rot and wet rot.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Rot-proof","recorded":1362675738,"links":12,"instances":["economics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical properties","Physical quantities"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/20101121_212039_Mildew.jpg/130px-20101121_212039_Mildew.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["production","economics"]],"members":["production"],"related":["Surface_finishing","Industry","Manufacturing","Production_(economics)","Biodegradation","Chemical_decomposition","Decomposition","Fungus","Mold","Mildew","Temperature","Dry_rot","Fireproofing","Rustproof","Toughness","Waterproofing"]}
