It was one of a series of battles, with\nhonours to both sides, that took place following an invasion of the then kingdom\nof Wessex by an army of Danes led by Bagsecg and Halfdan Ragnarsson in an\nattempt to conquer Wessex. Both battle and campaign are described in the Anglo-\nSaxon Chronicle, and this account provides the earliest known written record of\nthe existence of the town of Reading.\n\nThe Danes had established a camp at Reading, defended by the Thames and Kennet\nrivers on two sides, and by a rampart on the western side. Three days after\ntheir arrival, a party of Danes rode out towards nearby Englefield, where a West\nSaxon force under the command of Ãthelwulf, the Ealdorman of the shire, was\nwaiting for them. In the ensuing Battle of Englefield many of the Danes were\nkilled, and the rest driven back to Reading.\n\nFour days later, Ãthelwulf had been joined by the main West Saxon army, led by\nKing Ãthelred and his brother, Alfred the Great. The entire Saxon force marched\non Reading. The assault was directed mainly at a gateway through the ramparts,\nand fierce and bloody fighting followed, before the attack was repulsed. Among\nthe many dead of both sides was Ãthelwulf. The Saxon forces were forced to\nretreat, allowing the Danes to continue their advance into Wessex.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Reading, Ãthelred and Alfred reformed their army, and a\nfew days later won a famous victory at the Battle of Ashdown, forcing the Danes\nto retreat to Reading once more. Two weeks later the Danes won the Battle of\nBasing, and then, on 22 March, the Battle of Marton. In April Ãthelred died, to\nbe succeeded by Alfred. The Danish army remained in Reading until late in 871,\nwhen they retreated to winter quarters in London, and much of King Alfred's 28-\nyear reign was taken up with the Danish conflict.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Battle_of_Reading_(871)","recorded":1362484829,"links":27,"instances":["germanic_tribe"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Conflicts in 871","871 in Europe","Battles involving Wessex|Reading 0871","Battles involving the Vikings|Reading 0871","Battles involving Denmark|Reading 0871","History of Reading, Berkshire","Military history of Berkshire","9th century in England","870s in Europe"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Wyvern_of_Wessex.svg/70px-Wyvern_of_Wessex.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/RavenBanner.svg/70px-RavenBanner.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Military_symbol.svg/30px-Military_symbol.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Miecze.svg/30px-Miecze.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["danes","germanic_tribe"]],"members":["danes"],"related":["Norse_activity_in_the_British_Isles","Reading,_Berkshire","Berkshire","Wessex","Danelaw","Vikings","Æthelred_of_Wessex","Alfred_the_Great","Bagsecg","Halfdan_Ragnarsson","Battle","Reading,_Berkshire","England","Berkshire","Wessex","Danes_(Germanic_tribe)","Bagsecg","Halfdan_Ragnarsson","Wessex","Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle","River_Thames","River_Kennet","Englefield,_Berkshire","Wessex","Æthelwulf_of_Berkshire","Ealdorman","Battle_of_Englefield","Æthelred_of_Wessex","Alfred_the_Great","Battle_of_Ashdown","Battle_of_Basing","Battle_of_Marton","London"]}
