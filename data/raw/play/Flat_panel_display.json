They are far lighter and thinner than traditional television sets\nand video displays that use cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and are usually less than\nthick. (Some CRTs were designed to have a flat front surface, and equipment\nusing them was advertised as \"flat-screen\", which can cause confusion.)\n\nFlat panel displays can be divided into two general display technology\ncategories: volatile and static.\n\nThe first engineering proposal for a flat screen TV was by General Electric as a\nresult of its work on radar monitors. Their publication of their findings gave\nall the basics of future flat screen TVs and monitors. But GE did not continue\nwith the R&D required and never built a working flat screen at that time.

Plasma TV Science.org - [http://www.plasmatvscience.org/plasmatv-\nhistory1.html The History of Plasma Display Panels] The first-ever active-\nmatrix addressed display was made by T Peter Brody's Thin-Film Devices\ndepartment at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1968.\n\nIn many applications, specifically modern portable devices such as laptops,\nmobile phones, digital cameras, camcorders, point-and-shoot cameras, and pocket\nvideo cameras, any display disadvantages are made up for by portability\nadvantages.\n\nMost of the modern flat-panel displays use LCD technologies. Most LCD screens\nare backlit to make them easier to read in bright environments. They are thin\nand light. They provide better linearity and higher resolution.\n\nAs of 2012, 50% of global market share in flat panel display (FPD) production\nare solely dominated by Taiwanese manufacturers such as AU Optronics and Chimei\nInnolux Corporation.\n\n==Common ty\nLiquid crystal displays are lightweight, compact, portable, cheap, more\nreliable, and easier on the eyes than CRTs. A thin layer of liquid crystal, a\nliquid that exhibits crystalline properties, is sandwiched between 2\nelectrically conducting plates.The top plate has transparent electrodes\ndeposited on it, and the back plate is a mirror. By applying proper electrical\nsignals across the plates, various segments of the liquid crystal can be\nactivated, causing changes in their light diffusing or polarizing properties.\nThese segments can either transmit or block light. An image is produced by\npassing light through selected segments of the liquid crystal and then reflected\nit back from the mirror to the viewer. They are used in various electronics like\nwatches, calculators, and notebook computers.\n\nPlasma panels A plasma display consists of two glass plates separated by a thin\ngap filled with a gas such as neon. Each of these plates has several parallel\nelectrodes running across it. The electrodes on the two plates are at right\nangles to each other. A voltage applied between the two electrodes one on each\nplate causes a small segment of gas at the two electrodes to glow. The glow of\ngas segments is maintained by a lower voltage that is continuously applied to\nall electrodes. A similar pulsing arrangement is used to selectively turn\npoints off.\n\nElectroluminescent panels In an electroluminescent display (ELD), the image\nis created by applying electrical signals to the plates which makes the\nphosphor glow.\n","linknr":177,"url":"Flat_panel_display","recorded":1362684438,"links":29,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Display technology"],"headings":["Volatile","Static","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/TFT_Monitor_Flachbildschirm.jpg/220px-TFT_Monitor_Flachbildschirm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Electronic_visual_display","Television_set","Video_display","Cathode_ray_tube","Display_technology","University_of_Illinois","Active-matrix","T_Peter_Brody","Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation","Laptop","Mobile_phone","Digital_camera","Camcorder","Point-and-shoot_camera","Pocket_video_camera","AU_Optronics","Chimei_Innolux_Corporation","Liquid_crystal_display","Plasma_display","Electroluminescent_display","Active-matrix_liquid_crystal_display","Electronic_paper","E_Ink","Gyricon","Electroluminescent_display","Digital_Light_Processing","Field_emission_display","Interferometric_modulator_display","LED_display","Liquid_crystal_display","Organic_light-emitting_diode","Plasma_display","Quantum_dot_display","Surface-conduction_electron-emitter_display","Bistable","Electrophoretic_display","Computer_monitor","Electronic_paper","Flexible_display","Large-screen_television_technology","LED-backlit_LCD_television","Display_motion_blur","Mobile_display","On-vehicle_display","Sony_Watchman","Stereoscopy","Touch_panel","Transparent_display"]}
