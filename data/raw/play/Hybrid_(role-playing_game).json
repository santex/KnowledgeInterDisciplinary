The \"game\" is\nsaid to correctly model physical reality, and originated from a series of\n\"disjointed\" posts by the author on a Usenet board. Hybrid consists of over 500\ndifferent and non-sequential rules, many of them utilizing references to pop\nculture and politics, cross-references to other rules (existent or not) and even\nother completely different RPG's, equations with undefined variables, and other\nrandom content. The version numbering system is also non-sequential, version\n0.21 is considered newer than 0.34. An RPGnet reviewer declared Hybrid to be\n\"unmitigated nonsense\", and the game is also ranked as the 2nd worst RPG on the\nsite.\n","linknr":107,"url":"Hybrid_(role-playing_game)","recorded":1362543151,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Role-playing game systems"],"headings":["Rules","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/40px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Role_playing_game","Usenet","Pop_culture","Politics","Cross-reference","Undefined_variable","RPGnet"]}
