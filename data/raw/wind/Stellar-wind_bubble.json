{"cursor":"1664","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Stellar-wind bubble' is the astronomical term usually used to describe a cavity\nlight years across filled with hot gas blown into the interstellar medium by the\nhigh-velocity (several thousand km/s) stellar wind from a single massive star of\ntype O or B. Weaker stellar winds still blow bubble structures though, and these\nare also called 'astrospheres'. The heliosphere blown by the solar wind, within\nwhich all the major planets of the Solar System are embedded, is in fact a small\nexample of a stellar-wind bubble.\n\nStellar-wind bubbles have a two-shock structure. The freely-expanding\nstellar wind hits an inner termination shock, where its kinetic energy is\nthermalized, producing 10 6Â K, X-ray emitting plasma. The hot,\nhigh-pressure, shocked wind expands, driving a shock into the surrounding\ninterstellar gas. If the surrounding gas is dense enough (number densities\nn > 0.1 \\mbox{ cm}^{-3} or so), the swept up gas radiatively cools\nfar faster than the hot interior, forming a thin, relatively dense shell around\nthe hot, shocked wind.\n","linknr":303,"url":"Stellar-wind_bubble","recorded":1362480489,"links":22,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stellar astronomy","Galactic astronomy","Interstellar media"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/f/c1f954ee6ffcd74b372dcfff361cca5f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/He1523a.jpg/15px-He1523a.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"]],"members":["plasma"],"related":["Astronomy","Interstellar_medium","Stellar_wind","Star","Stellar_classification","O_star","B_V_star","Stellar_wind","Heliosphere","Solar_wind","Planet","Solar_System","Stellar_wind","Kelvin","X-ray","Plasma_(physics)"]}
