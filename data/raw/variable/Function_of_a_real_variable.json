{"cursor":"1400","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'function of a real variable' is a mathematical function whose\ndomain is the real line. More loosely, a function of a real variable is\nsometimes taken to mean any function whose domain is a subset of the real line.\n\nFunctions of a real variable were the classical object of study in mathematical\nanalysis, specifically real analysis. In that context, a function of a real\nvariable was usually meant a real-valued function of a real variable, that is, a\nfunction whose domain and codomain were the real numbers. However, because of\ntheir convenience in fields such as Fourier analysis, it was also common to\nconsider complex functions of a real variable, that is, a function whose domain\nwas the real numbers and whose range was the complex numbers.\n\nUntil the introduction of functional analysis in the 1920s, the study of\nfunctions of a real variable was one of the two major subdivisions of\nmathematical analysis. The other was the study of functions of a complex\nvariable, otherwise known as complex analysis.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Function_of_a_real_variable","recorded":1362540098,"links":15,"instances":["mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Real analysis","Mathematical terminology","Types of functions"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["domain","mathematics"]],"members":["domain"],"related":["Mathematics","Mathematical_function","Domain_(mathematics)","Real_line","Real_line","Mathematical_analysis","Real_analysis","Codomain","Fourier_analysis","Functional_analysis","Complex_analysis","Real-valued_function"]}
