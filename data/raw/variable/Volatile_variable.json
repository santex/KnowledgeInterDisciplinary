{"cursor":"14154","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computer programming, particularly in the C, C++, C#, and Java programming\nlanguages, a variable or object declared with the 'volatile' keyword usually has\nspecial properties related to optimization and/or threading. Generally speaking,\nthe 'volatile' keyword is intended to prevent the compiler from applying any\noptimizations on the code that assume values of variables cannot change \"on\ntheir own.\"\n\nThe actual definition and applicability of the 'volatile' keyword is often\nmisconstrued in the context of the C language. Although C++, C#, and Java share\nthe same keyword volatile from C, there is a great deal of difference between\nthe semantics and usefulness of 'volatile' in each of these programming\nlanguages.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Volatile_variable","recorded":1362676443,"links":20,"instances":["computer_programming","computer_science","programming","computer_science","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","computer_science","programming_language"],"pdf":["http://www.aristeia.com/Papers/DDJ_Jul_Aug_2004_revised.pdf"],"categories":["C programming language","Variable (computer programming)","Concurrency control"],"headings":["In C and C++","In Java","In C#","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["c","programming_language"],["c_sharp","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["variable","programming"],["object","computer_science"],["keyword","computer_programming"],["java","programming_language"],["polling","computer_science"],["thread","computer_science"],["lock","computer_science"],["c_sharp","programming_language"]],"members":["keyword","object","variable","lock","polling","java","c","thread","c_sharp"],"related":["Computer_programming","C_(programming_language)","C++","C_Sharp_(programming_language)","Java_(programming_language)","Variable_(programming)","Object_(computer_science)","Keyword_(computer_programming)","Java_(programming_language)","Memory-mapped_I/O","Setjmp","Atomic_operation","Polling_(computer_science)","Optimizing_compiler","Infinite_loop","Hardware_register","CPU","Memory_barrier","GNU_Compiler_Collection","Andrei_Alexandrescu","Java_programming_language","Thread_(computer_science)","Happened-before","Sun_Microsystems","Lock_(computer_science)","Double-checked_locking","C_Sharp_(programming_language)"]}
