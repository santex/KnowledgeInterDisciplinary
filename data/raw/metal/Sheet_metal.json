It is one of\nthe fundamental forms used in metalworking and can be cut and bent into a\nvariety of different shapes. Countless everyday objects are constructed with\nsheet metal. Thicknesses can vary significantly; extremely thin thicknesses are\nconsidered foil or leaf, and pieces thicker than 6 mm (0.25 in) are\nconsidered plate.\n\nSheet metal is available in flat pieces or as a coiled strip. The coils are\nformed by running a continuous sheet of metal through a roll slitter.\n\nThe thickness of the sheet metal is called its gauge. Commonly used steel sheet\nmetal ranges from 30 gauge to about 8 gauge. The larger the gauge number, the\nthinner the metal. Gauge is measured in ferrous (iron based) metals while\nnonferrous metals such as aluminum or copper are designated differently; i.e.\nCopper is measured in thickness by Ounce.\n\nThere are many different metals that can be made into sheet metal, such as\naluminum, brass, copper, steel, tin, nickel and titanium. For decorative uses,\nimportant sheet metals include silver, gold, and platinum (platinum sheet metal\nis also utilized as a catalyst.)\n\nSheet metal also has applications in car bodies, airplane wings, medical tables,\nroofs for buildings (Architectural) and many other things. Sheet metal of iron\nand other materials with high magnetic permeability, also known as laminated\nsteel cores, has applications in transformers and electric machines.\nHistorically, an important use of sheet metal was in plate armor worn by\ncavalry, and sheet metal continues to have many decorative uses, including in\nhorse tack. Sheet metal workers are also known as \"Tin Bashers\",(\"Tin Knockers\")\nwhich is derived from the hammering of panel seams when installing tin roofs.\n\nLayout Techniques There are three primary procedures in Layout. 1. Parallel\n2.Radial 3. Triangulation.\n","linknr":380,"url":"Sheet_metal","recorded":1362669039,"links":56,"instances":["mechanical","metalworking","furniture","metalworking","metalworking","polymers","metalworking","electromagnetism"],"pdf":["http://www.coyotesteel.com/assets/img/PDFs/ASTM-ASTI_thicknessTolerance.pdf"],"categories":["Metal forming","Fabrication (metal)"],"headings":["Materials","Gauge","Forming processes","Fasteners","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Acap.svg/36px-Acap.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Chrysler_Building_detail.jpg/220px-Chrysler_Building_detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Mild_steel_sheet_metal_close_up.jpg/250px-Mild_steel_sheet_metal_close_up.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Thickness_vs_gauge.png/220px-Thickness_vs_gauge.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/a/3/8a3c2af37b0ee5dceb6a90cb59def800.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Parts_made_by_deep_drawing_-_20100630.jpg/220px-Parts_made_by_deep_drawing_-_20100630.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Biegeanimation_3D.gif/220px-Biegeanimation_3D.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Rundwalzen.png/220px-Rundwalzen.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["permeability","electromagnetism"],["stamping","metalworking"],["spinning","polymers"],["drawing","metalworking"],["cabinet","furniture"],["fan","mechanical"],["rolling","metalworking"],["bending","metalworking"]],"members":["fan","rolling","cabinet","drawing","stamping","spinning","bending","permeability"],"related":["Metal","Metalworking","Foil","Metal_leaf","Structural_steel","Roll_slitting","Sheet_metal_gauge","Iron","Aluminum","Brass","Copper","Steel","Tin","Nickel","Titanium","Silver","Gold","Platinum","Catalyst","Permeability_(electromagnetism)","Transformer","Electric_machine","Plate_armor","Cavalry","Horse_tack","Stainless_steel","Formability","Weldability","Brushed_metal","Pump","Valve","Heat_treating","Cutlery","Aluminium","Deep_drawing","Jewelry","Stamping_(metalworking)","Spinning_(polymers)","Drawing_(metalworking)","Mail_box","Cabinet_(furniture)","Tank","Fan_(mechanical)","Pressure_vessel","6061_aluminium_alloy","Rolling_(metalworking)","Sheet_metal_operations","Ultimate_tensile_strength","Aluminum_can","Brickwork","Tin_snips","Surform","Bending_(metalworking)","Brake_press","Back_gauge","Progressive_stamping","Machine_press","Mandrel","Repoussé_and_chasing","Cleko","Rivet","Sheet_metal_screw","Circle_grid_analysis","Forming_limit_diagram","Diamond_plate","Strip_steel","Temper_mill"]}
