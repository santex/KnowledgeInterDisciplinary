Liquidmetal alloys combine a number\nof desirable material features, including high tensile strength, excellent\ncorrosion resistance, very high coefficient of restitution and excellent anti-\nwearing characteristics, while also being able to be heat-formed in processes\nsimilar to thermoplastics. Despite the name, they are not liquid at room\ntemperature. liquidmetal.com.\n[http://coatings.liquidmetal.com/our.material.asp Liquidmetal Coatings\nMaterial]. Retrieved 2008-10-23\n\nLiquidmetal was introduced for commercial applications in 2003. It is used for,\namong other things, golf clubs, watches and covers of cell phones.\n\nThe alloy was the end result of a research program into amorphous metals carried\nout at Caltech. It was the first of a series of experimental alloys that could\nachieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling rates. Amorphous\nmetals had been made before, but only in small batches because cooling rates\nneeded to be in the millions of degrees per second. For example, amorphous wires\ncould be fabricated by splat cooling a stream of molten metal on a spinning\ndisk. Because Vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates, production of larger\nbatch sizes was possible. More recently, a number of additional alloys have been\nadded to the Liquidmetal portfolio. These alloys also retain their amorphous\nstructure after repeated re-heating, allowing them to be used in a wide variety\nof traditional machining processes.\n","linknr":257,"url":"Liquidmetal","recorded":1362481753,"links":21,"instances":["spacecraft","company","engineering","process","equipment"],"pdf":["http://www.materialstoday.com/pdfs_7_3/telford.pdf"],"categories":["Alloys","Amorphous metals","California Institute of Technology","2003 introductions","The Swatch Group","Apple Inc. industrial design"],"headings":["Characteristics","Uses","Commercial alloys","Licensed uses","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["golf_club","equipment"],["molding","process"],["yield","engineering"],["vertu","company"],["genesis","spacecraft"]],"members":["genesis","vertu","yield","molding","golf_club"],"related":["Amorphous_metal","Alloy","California_Institute_of_Technology","Tensile_strength","Corrosion_resistance","Coefficient_of_restitution","Thermoplastic","Golf_club_(equipment)","Watch","Cell_phone","Glass","Molding_(process)","Amorphous","Titanium","Aluminum","Yield_(engineering)","Composite_material","Tensile_strength","Ball_bearing","Plastic_deformation","Catastrophic_failure","Metal_matrix_composite","Golf_ball","Ski","Baseball_bat","Tennis_racquet","Wear","Plastic","SanDisk","USB_flash_drive","Sandisk_Sansa","Flash_memory","Digital_audio_player","Mobile_phone","Vertu_(company)","IPhone","Apple_Inc.","Petroleum","Drill_string","Thermal_power_station","Water-tube_boiler","Depleted_uranium","Kinetic_energy_penetrator","Solar_wind","Ion","Genesis_(spacecraft)","Strength_to_weight_ratio","Aluminium","Zirconium","Apple_Inc.","The_Swatch_Group"]}
