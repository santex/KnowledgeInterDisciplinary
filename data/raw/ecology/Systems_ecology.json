{"cursor":"11486","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Systems ecology' is an interdisciplinary field of ecology, taking a holistic\napproach to the study of ecological systems, especially ecosystems. Systems\necology can be seen as an application of general systems theory to ecology.\nCentral to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a\ncomplex system exhibiting emergent properties. Systems ecology focuses on\ninteractions and transactions within and between biological and ecological\nsystems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems\ncan be influenced by human interventions. It uses and extends concepts from\nthermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.\n","linknr":662,"url":"Systems_ecology","recorded":1362476973,"links":27,"instances":["new_hampshire"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Systems ecology|","Environmental science","Environmental social science","Formal sciences","Systems theory|Ecology"],"headings":["Overview","Summary of relationships in systems ecology","Closely related fields","See also","References","Literature","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/300px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f7/Summary_of_Relationships.jpg/300px-Summary_of_Relationships.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Ecoecolfigure1.jpg/220px-Ecoecolfigure1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Complex-adaptive-system.jpg/32px-Complex-adaptive-system.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/FoodWeb.jpg/140px-FoodWeb.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg/140px-Genomics_GTL_Program_Payoffs.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["white_mountains","new_hampshire"]],"members":["white_mountains"],"related":["Interdisciplinary","Ecology","Holism","Ecosystem","General_systems_theory","Complex_system","Emergent_properties","Thermodynamics","Ecological_economics","R.L._Kitching","Principles_of_energetics","Howard_T._Odum","Ecosystem_principles","Formal_analogy","Energy_Systems_Language","Maximum_power","Ecological_engineering","Electronic_engineer","Arne_Naess","Gandhi","Environmental_activist","Environmental_management","Anthropocentric","J.B.S._Haldane","Joanna_Macy","John_Seed","Ecological_self","Altruism","Biospherical_equality","Human_chauvinism","Complexity","Natural_environment","System","Environmental_science","Ecosystem","Economics","Ecology","Environmental_economics","Principles","Principles_of_energetics","Western_culture","Eastern_culture","Indigenous_peoples","Ecology","White_Mountains_(New_Hampshire)","New_Hampshire","Life","Abiotic","Ecosystem","Science","Chemical","Bedrock","Soil","Plant","Animal","Industrial_process","Agroecology","Ecological_literacy","Emergy","Energetics","Energy_Systems_Language","Holism_in_science","Holistic_management","Landscape_ecology","Antireductionism","Biosemiotics","Ecosemiotics","Gregory_Bateson","Howard_T._Odum"]}
