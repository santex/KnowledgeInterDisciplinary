{"cursor":"3525","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Delivery' was a British blues/progressive rock musical group, formed in the\nlate 1960s. The band was one of the wellsprings of the progressive rock\nCanterbury scene.\n\nFounded in 1966 as 'Bruno's Blues Band' by guitarist Phil Miller, his elder\nbrother, pianist Steve Miller, drummer Pip Pyle and bassist Jack Monck, the band\ngigged around London for a few years. In 1968, saxophonist Lol Coxhill joined\nthem, and the band's name was changed to 'Steve Miller's Delivery'. In 1969, the\nband teamed up with blues singer Carol Grimes and bassist Roy Babbington\nreplaced Monck. The resulting line-up recorded and released one album: [[Fools\nMeeting]]. Although Grimes wanted to appear as a band member, the record company\nreleased the album under \"Carol Grimes and Delivery\". In 1971, Pyle left the\nband to join Gong and was replaced by Laurie Allan (who also later joined Gong).\nSoon after that, the band broke up.\n\nPhil Miller went on to found Matching Mole with Robert Wyatt and Dave Sinclair,\nbut a new Delivery line-up was assembled in the spring of 1972 consisting of\nthe Miller brothers, Pyle and Richard Sinclair (bass and vocals), then Steve\nMiller's bandmate in Caravan. The band played a few live shows in\nAugust/September that year, but with Steve Miller being replaced by Dave\nSinclair (from Matching Mole and Caravan), the band changed its name to\nHatfield and the North. A final Delivery performance took place in November\n1972 for the BBC's Radio One In Concert series, with an unusual line-up\nbringing together the Miller brothers, Pyle, Babbington, Coxhill and Sinclair,\nthe latter on vocals only.\n\nSteve Miller went on to release two shared (rather than \"duo\") albums with\nCoxhill for Virgin's Caroline budget label in 1973/74.\n\nRoy Babbington, who had played with the Keith Tippett Group and Nucleus in 1971-\n73, went on to join Soft Machine from 1973-76. Laurie Allan rejoined Gong a\ncouple of times, most notably appearing on 1973's Flying Teapot, and later\nBarbara Thompson's Paraphernalia.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Delivery_(band)","recorded":1363183864,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Blues","/wiki/Progressive_rock","/wiki/Canterbury_scene","/wiki/Phil_Miller","/w/index.php?title=Steve_Miller_(keyboardist)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Pip_Pyle","/wiki/Jack_Monck","/wiki/London","/wiki/Lol_Coxhill","/wiki/Carol_Grimes","/wiki/Roy_Babbington","/wiki/Fools_Meeting","/wiki/Gong_(band)","/wiki/Laurie_Allan","/wiki/Matching_Mole","/wiki/Robert_Wyatt","/wiki/Dave_Sinclair","/wiki/Richard_Sinclair","/wiki/Caravan_(band)","/wiki/Matching_Mole","/wiki/Caravan_(band)","/wiki/Hatfield_and_the_North","/wiki/Keith_Tippett","/wiki/Nucleus_(band)","/wiki/Soft_Machine","/wiki/Gong_(band)","/wiki/Barbara_Thompson_(musician)","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Fools_Meeting","/wiki/Album","/wiki/Single_(music)","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=edit&section=2","http://calyx.club.fr/bands/obscure.html#delivery","http://calyx.club.fr","http://www.macgraphic.co.jp/ich/","http://calyx.club.fr/mus/miller_steve.html","http://calyx.club.fr","http://www.allclassical.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:lvfe4jj71wa4~T1","http://www.allmusic.com","http://www.carolgrimes.com/reviews_press/archive.html#fools","http://www.carolgrimes.com","http://www.musicstreetjournal.com/deliver.htm","http://www.musicstreetjournal.com","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&oldid=540931640","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Canterbury_scene","/wiki/Category:English_progressive_rock_groups","/wiki/Category:English_rock_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Musical_groups_established_in_1968","/wiki/Category:Articles_lacking_sources_from_May_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_lacking_sources","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Delivery+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Delivery+%28band%29","/wiki/Delivery_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Delivery_(band)","#","/wiki/Delivery_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Delivery_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Delivery_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&oldid=540931640","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Delivery_%28band%29&id=540931640","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Delivery+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Delivery+%28band%29&oldid=540931640&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Delivery_(band)&printable=yes","//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(Band)","//it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(gruppo_musicale)","//hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery","//nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery","//ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%87%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Delivery
