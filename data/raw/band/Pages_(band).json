The\nband consisted of Richard Page and Steve George on vocals and keyboards,\nsupported by various studio musicians, some of whom from time to time were\nconsidered part of the band proper. Although Pages was highly regarded for its\nwell-crafted pop and jazz-fusion sound, the group did not achieve commercial\nsuccess, and disbanded after recording three albums. Pages is perhaps best known\nas the launching pad for the recording careers of Page and George, who later\nformed Mr. Mister and topped the charts during the mid-1980s with pop classics\nsuch as \"Broken Wings\" and \"Kyrie.\"\n","linknr":142,"url":"Pages_(band)","recorded":1362551519,"links":13,"instances":["musician","keyboardist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Musical groups from Los Angeles, California","American pop rock music groups","American soft rock music groups"],"headings":["Origins","''Pages'' (1978)","''Future Street'' (1979)","''Pages'' (1981)","After Pages","Discography","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/51/Pages_%28band%29.jpg/220px-Pages_%28band%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["richard_page","musician"],["steve_george","keyboardist"],["richard_page","musician"],["steve_george","keyboardist"]],"members":["richard_page","steve_george"],"related":["Los_Angeles","California","United_States","Pop_rock","Soft_rock","Epic_Records","Capitol_Records","Mr._Mister","Third_Matinee","Richard_Page_(musician)","Steve_George_(keyboardist)","Charles_Foster_Johnson","United_States","Pop_rock","Musical_ensemble","Richard_Page_(musician)","Steve_George_(keyboardist)","Mr._Mister","Phoenix,_Arizona","Los_Angeles","Las_Vegas_Valley","Andy_Gibb","I_Just_Want_to_Be_Your_Everything","Blood,_Sweat_&_Tears","Bobby_Colomby","Epic_Records","Eponym","Charles_Foster_Johnson","Capitol_Records","Jay_Graydon","Tommy_Funderburk","Like_a_Virgin","Billboard_200","Epic_Records","Epic_Records","Capitol_Records","Billboard_Hot_100"]}
