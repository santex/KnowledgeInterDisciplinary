{"cursor":"3015","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Technique' was a female alternative synth pop band from the mid-1990s featuring\nKate Holmes of Frazier Chorus and singer Xan Tyler. The band was named after New\nOrder's 1989 album of the same name, and they were signed to Creation Records,\nthe record label owned by Holmes's husband - Alan McGee.\n\nHolmes and Tyler met at Butterfly, the studio owned by legendary producer and\nformer Killing Joke member Youth, where Tyler was working as a session backing\nvocalist. They began work on their debut album, with synthpop veteran Stephen\nHague and Oasis producer Owen Morris handling production duties alongside Holmes\nherself. Other notable contributors to the album included Ash frontman Tim\nWheeler, vocalist Kirsty Hawkshaw and Youth himself on bass.\n\nTechnique released two singles on Creation in the summer of 1999 - \"Sun is\nShining\" and \"You & Me\". \"Sun is Shining\" reached No. 64 in the UK Singles Chart\nin April 1999 and \"You & Me\" got to No. 56 in August of the same\nyear. Roberts, David. Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums.\nGuinness World Records Ltd 17th edition (2004), p. 551 ISBN 0-85112-199-3\nThe album, by now entitled Pop Philosophy, was promo-ed but never officially saw\nthe light of day after McGee decided to close the label. Technique lay dormant\nfor several years while McGee set up his new venture, Poptones. Holmes and Tyler\nboth contributed to Mission Control's Dub Showcase album (produced by Holmes's\nlong-term associated Mad Professor), which featured several unreleased songs\nfrom Pop Philosophy.\n\nIn 2000, C-pop singer Coco Lee had a huge hit on the Asian market with a cover\nof Technique's second single, You and Me. Following this, Poptones released a\ntruncated version of Pop Philosophy in Germany and Asia, featuring seven tracks\nplus two remixes by Matt Darey. Sun is Shining and You & Me were also re-\nreleased in Germany, and the band toured extensively during 2001.\n\nTechnique ended, but more was to come from the mysterious electro-pop band\nClient when Tyler was unable to take part in a tour supporting Depeche Mode.\nKate Holmes replaced her with Sarah Blackwood from Newcastle-upon-Tyne band\nDubstar, and shortly thereafter the two decided to collaborate and write\nmaterial together, and they created the new band.\n\nFrom this Depeche Mode tour a new masterplan was put in place, with the two\nbecoming Client A and Client B, plus a new deal with Andy Fletcher's Toast\nHawaii record label.\n","linknr":121,"url":"Technique_(band)","recorded":1363351016,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Technique_(disambiguation)","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Pop_(music)","/wiki/Frazier_Chorus","/wiki/Xan_Tyler","/wiki/New_Order","/wiki/Creation_Records","/wiki/Alan_McGee","/wiki/Record_producer","/wiki/Killing_Joke","/wiki/Synthpop","/wiki/Oasis_(band)","/wiki/Ash_(band)","/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Poptones","/wiki/Mad_Professor","/wiki/C-pop","/wiki/Coco_Lee","/wiki/Matt_Darey","/wiki/Client_(band)","/wiki/Depeche_Mode","/wiki/Sarah_Blackwood","/wiki/Newcastle-upon-Tyne","/wiki/Dubstar","/wiki/Andrew_Fletcher_(musician)","/wiki/Toast_Hawaii_(record_label)","/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0851121993","/wiki/File:MusicalnotesUK.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/MusicalnotesUK.svg/35px-MusicalnotesUK.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:UK-electronic-band-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:UK-electronic-band-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:UK-electronic-band-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Musical_notes.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Musical_notes.svg/35px-Musical_notes.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:House-band-stub","/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:House-band-stub&action=edit&redlink=1","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:House-band-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&oldid=504856752","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Creation_Records_artists","/wiki/Category:British_electronic_music_groups","/wiki/Category:British_pop_music_groups","/wiki/Category:Synthpop_groups","/wiki/Category:United_Kingdom_electronic_musical_group_stubs","/wiki/Category:House_music_group_stubs","/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_additional_references_from_September_2010","/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_additional_references","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Technique+%28band%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Technique+%28band%29","/wiki/Technique_(band)","/wiki/Talk:Technique_(band)","#","/wiki/Technique_(band)","/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Technique_(band)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Technique_(band)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&oldid=504856752","/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Technique_%28band%29&id=504856752","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Technique+%28band%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Technique+%28band%29&oldid=504856752&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Technique_(band)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:
