The name 'Grand Slam' was\ninvented after a plethora of other band names had been considered, including\n'Reactor Factor', 'Catastrophe', 'Hell Bent On Havoc', 'Slam Anthem' and 'Slam'\n(which was actually the name of a song Lynott had in mind), before settling on\n'Grand Slam'.\n\nGrand Slam had little commercial success, but they did release some songs of\nnote, most of which have been accredited to Thin Lizzy, including \"Nineteen\",\n\"Sisters of Mercy\", \"Military Man\" (which was actually recorded and released by\nGary Moore on his 1985 album [[Run for Cover (album)|Run For Cover]]), and\n\"Dedication.\" The latter became the subject of controversy upon its inclusion as\nthe title track of the [[Dedication: The Very Best of Thin Lizzy]] compilation\nin 1991. Originally recorded as a Grand Slam demo by its authors, Laurence\nArcher and Phil Lynott, Thin Lizzy's management had former members Scott Gorham\nand Brian Downey overdub guitar and drum tracks, respectively, and in an attempt\nto pass the song off as a Lynott solo composition cut out Archer uncredited. The\nguitarist later settled out-of-court for a share of the publishing.\n\nAlthough Lynott had originally intended to include two members of the most\nrecent Thin Lizzy lineup, guitarist John Sykes and (after having been turned\ndown by MotÃ¶rhead drummer \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor), drummer Brian Downey. Downey\ndeclined, saying he \"didn't see the point in making a second-rate Thin Lizzy\",\nand Sykes, after much cajoling (as well as an impressive financial offer) from\nDavid Coverdale, left to join Whitesnake.\n\nLynott, although downhearted, carried on with his project, ending up with a line-\nup of Laurence Archer (lead guitar; ex-Stampede, Wild Horses, Lautrec), Donal\n'Doish' Nagle (guitar; ex-The Bogey\nBoys), http://irishrock.org/ipnw/bands/bogeyboys.html Robbie Brennan\n(drums), Mark Stanway (keyboards; ex-Magnum) and himself on bass guitar and\nvocals, as well as chief songwriting duties.\n\nLynott earned the nickname Sergeant Rock at the rehearsals at the E'EE studios\nin London, due to his almost overbearing strictness and dedication to the\nrehearsal drill.\n\nLynott was keen to shed the 'second-rate Thin Lizzy' tag, and was adamant that\nthey should only ever perform three Lizzy songs live (\"Cold Sweat\", from their\n1983 album [[Thunder and Lightning (album)|Thunder and Lightning]], \"Sarah\",\nfrom Lizzy's 1979 album [[Black Rose: A Rock Legend]], and the crowd favorite,\n\"Whiskey In the Jar\", which can be found on Grand Slam's [[Grand Slam: Live\n1984|Live 1984]] disc).\n\nGrand Slam split up in 1985, due to their lack of commercial success, and\ninability to secure a record deal (largely due to Lynott's reputation as a drug\nuser during his later Thin Lizzy days), although they were rumoured to be\nexcellent live, and had a large cult fan following.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, keyboardist Mark Stanway produced and released a live CD,\n[[Grand Slam: Live 1984]], and a compilation of Grand Slam songs, demos and\ninterviews, [[Studio Sessions (Grand Slam)|Studio Sessions]].\n\nFrontman Phil Lynott died on 4 January 1986 from liver, heart and kidney\nfailure, due to 7 years of drug abuse and alcohol excess.\n\nGuitarist Laurence Archer recorded a solo album, titled LA, in 1986, and went on\nto record and tour with a number of acts, including Brian Spence, Long Island\nRed, UFO, and Medicine Head before retiring from the music business in 1994. In\n2009, Archer reformed his old band, Stampede, who have since played a number of\nUK shows and are reportedly working on a new studio album.
