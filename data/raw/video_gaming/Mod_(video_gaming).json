{"cursor":"20355","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Mod' or 'modification' is a term generally applied to personal computer games\n(PC games), especially first-person shooters, role-playing games and real-time\nstrategy games. Mods are made by the general public or a developer and can be\nentirely new games in themselves, but mods are not stand-alone software and\nrequire the user to have the original release in order to run. They can include\nnew items, weapons, characters, enemies, models, textures, levels, story lines,\nmusic, and game modes. They also usually take place in unique locations. They\ncan be single-player or multiplayer. Mods that add new content to the underlying\ngame are often called 'partial conversions', while mods that create an entirely\nnew game are called 'total conversions' and mods that fix bugs only are called\n'[[unofficial patch]]es'.\n\nGames running on a PC are often designed with change in mind, allowing modern\ncomputer games to be modified by gamers without much difficulty. These mods\ncan add extra replay value and interest. The Internet provides an inexpensive\nmedium to promote and distribute mods, and they have become an increasingly\nimportant factor in the commercial success of some games. Developers such as\nid Software, Valve Software, Bethesda Softworks, Firaxis, Crytek, The Creative\nAssembly and Epic Games provide extensive tools and documentation to assist\nmod makers, leveraging the potential success brought in by a popular mod like\n[[Counter-Strike]].\n\nMods can significantly outshine and help to continue the success of the original\ngame, even when the original game has become dated. In that case, players might\nhave to clarify that they are referring to the unmodified game when talking\nabout playing a game. The term vanilla is often used make this distinction.\n\"Vanilla [[Battlefield 1942]]\", for example, refers to the original, unmodified\ngame. For vanilla games, prefix \"v\" or \"V\" is commonly used together with the\ngame title acronym, e.g., VQ3 stands for \"vanilla [[Quake III Arena|Quake 3]]\".\n\nAs early as the 1980s, computer game mods have been used for the sole purpose of\ncreating art, as opposed to an actual game. They can include recording in-game\naction as a movie, as well as attempting to reproduce real-life areas inside a\ngame with no regard for game play value. See also artistic computer game\nmodification, machinima, and demoscene.\n","linknr":333,"url":"Mod_(video_gaming)","recorded":1362676355,"links":36,"instances":["game_engine","software_development","software","series","software","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://ljudmila.org/~selectparks/dl/PippaStalker_GamingInArt.pdf","http://web.student.tuwien.ac.at/~e0326417/game_mods/game_mods.pdf"],"categories":["Video game mods","Video game development"],"headings":["Types","Official status of mods","Development","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Vg_development_icon.svg/100px-Vg_development_icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/da/Audi_Vice_City.JPG/250px-Audi_Vice_City.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["prefix","linguistics"],["grand_theft_auto","series"],["source","game_engine"],["source","game_engine"],["steam","software"],["maya","software"],["fork","software_development"]],"members":["source","fork","maya","grand_theft_auto","steam","prefix"],"related":["Personal_computer_game","First-person_shooter","Role-playing_game","Real-time_strategy","Single-player_video_game","Multiplayer_video_game","Internet","Id_Software","Valve_Software","Bethesda_Softworks","Firaxis","Crytek","The_Creative_Assembly","Epic_Games","Prefix_(linguistics)","Acronym","Artistic_computer_game_modification","Machinima","Demoscene","First-person_shooter","Video_game_genres","Copyright_infringement","Free_Software","Minecraft","Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)","Valve_Corporation","Source_(game_engine)","Software_bug","Hot_Coffee_mod","Parent","Video_game_art","Art_game","Performance_art","University_of_the_Witwatersrand","Vienna_University_of_Technology","Iimura_Takahiko","Firaxis","Gameplay","First-person_shooter","Command_&_Conquer_series","Open_source","Strategic_Simulations,_Inc.","Aurora_toolset","Software_development_kit","Valve_Hammer_Editor","Level_design","Source_(game_engine)","Quake_engine","Steam_(software)","Gmod_","Olympus_Games_","Bitmap","Maya_(software)","Linux","Aspyr","Id_Software","Epic_Games","UnrealEd","Macologist","CNET","YouTube","Malware","CNET.com","YouTube","DayZ","Cinema_Blend","Adventure_Construction_Set","Cartridge_tilting","Fork_(software_development)","Level_editor","Modding","ROM_hacking","Texture_artist","Steam_Workshop","NexusMods"]}
