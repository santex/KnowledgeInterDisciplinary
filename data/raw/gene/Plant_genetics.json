There are many facets of genetics in\ngeneral, and of course there are many facets to plants. The definition of\ngenetics is the branch of biology that deals with heredity, especially the\nmechanisms of hereditary transmission and the variation of inherited\ncharacteristics among similar or related organisms. Brooker, Robert.\nGenetics Analysis and Principles. 3rd. New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2009. Print.\n And the definition of a plant is any of various photosynthetic,\neukaryotic, multicellular organisms of the kingdom Plantae characteristically\nproducing embryos, containing chloroplasts, having cell walls which contain\ncellulose, and lacking the power of locomotion. Stern, Kingsley.\nIntroductory Plant Biology. 11th. New York City: McGraw-Hill, 2008.\nAlthough there has been a revolution in the biological sciences in the past\ntwenty years, there is still a great deal that remains to be discovered. The\ncompletion of the sequencing of the human genome, as well as the genomes of some\nagriculturally and scientifically important plants (for example rice), has\nincreased the possibilities of genetic research immeasurably.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Plant_genetics","recorded":1362506010,"links":17,"instances":["biological","herbicide","biology","biology","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant reproduction","Genetics"],"headings":["Features of plant biology","DNA","Gregor Mendel","Modern ways to genetically modify plants","Genetically engineered crops","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Genome_gradient.jpg/220px-Genome_gradient.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/DNA_Overview.png/100px-DNA_Overview.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg/32px-Rose_Amber_Flush_20070601.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["trait","biological"],["transformation","genetics"],["tissue","biology"],["roundup","herbicide"]],"members":["trait","roundup","tissue","cell","transformation"],"related":["Genetics","Plants","Biology","Heredity","Organisms","Photosynthetic","Eukaryotic","Organisms","Plantae","Embryos","Chloroplasts","Cell_(biology)","Cell_wall","Cellulose","Animal_locomotion","Human_genome","Genome","Rice","Mitochondria","Somatic_mutation","Germ_line","Cultivar","Self-fertilization","Polyploid","Wheat","Maize","Potatoes","Peanut","Strawberries","Tobacco","Orchids","Nucleic_acid","Geneticist","Plant_geneticist","Genotype","Phenotype","Gregor_Mendel","Augustinians","Priest","Trait_(biological)","Mendelian_inheritance","Transformation_(genetics)","Gene_gun","Ballistics","In_vivo","Monocotyledon","Maize","Tungsten","Tissue_(biology)","Dicotyledon","Soybeans","Tomatoes","Frequency","Tumor","Antibiotic","Herbicide","Plant_tissue_culture","Hormones","Progeny","Pesticides","Roundup_Ready_Corn","Transgenic_maize","Roundup_(herbicide)","Bt_cotton","Bioethics","Biological_engineering","Biotechnology_High_School","Biotechnology","Canola","Cloning","Pioneer_Hi-Bred","Ethics_of_technology","Eugenics","Experimental_evolution","Gene_flow","Gene_pool","Genetic_erosion","Genetic_pollution","Genetically_modified_organisms","Human_genetic_engineering","Ice-minus_bacteria","List_of_emerging_technologies","Marker_assisted_selection","Monsanto_Company","Paratransgenesis","Recombinant_DNA","Research_ethics","Stem_cell","Synthetic_biology","Transgene","Transgenic_bacteria"]}
