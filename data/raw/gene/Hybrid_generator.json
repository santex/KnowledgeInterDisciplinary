{"cursor":"8886","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'stand-alone power system' ('SAPS' or 'SPS'), also known as 'remote area power\nsupply' ('RAPS'), is an off-the-grid electricity system for locations that are\nnot fitted with an electricity distribution system. Typical SAPS include one or\nmore methods of electricity generation, energy storage, and regulation.\n\nElectricity is typically generated by one or more of the following methods:\n* Solar panel\n* Wind turbine\n* Geothermal source\n* Micro combined heat and power\n* Micro hydro\n* Diesel or biofuel generator\n\nStorage is typically implemented as a battery bank, but other solutions exist\nincluding fuel cells. Power drawn directly from the battery will be direct\ncurrent extra low voltage (DC ELV), and this is used especially for lighting as\nwell as for DC appliances. An inverter is used to generate AC low voltage, which\nmore typical appliances can be used with. , Spain]]\n\nStand-alone photovoltaic power systems are independent of the utility grid and\nmay use solar panels only or may be used in conjunction with a diesel generator\nor a wind turbine.\n","linknr":190,"url":"Hybrid_generator","recorded":1362543127,"links":22,"instances":["electricity"],"pdf":["http://www.trisanita.org/jases/asespaper2010/ases09v5n1y2010.pdf","http://www.trisanita.org/jases/asespaper2010/ases09v5n1y2010.pdf","http://www.localenergy.org/pdfs/Document%20Library/Fundamentals%20of%20batteries%20and%20charge%20control.pdf","http://www.localenergy.org/pdfs/Document%20Library/Fundamentals%20of%20batteries%20and%20charge%20control.pdf"],"categories":["Electric power generation"],"headings":["Types","Hybrid system","System monitoring","Performance assessment","Load related problems","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Depuradora_de_Lluc.JPG/380px-Depuradora_de_Lluc.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/22/PV-system_log_cabin.png/280px-PV-system_log_cabin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/PV-system_country_home1.png/300px-PV-system_country_home1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/TicketParkingMeter.jpg/150px-TicketParkingMeter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Wind-turbine-icon.svg/28px-Wind-turbine-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Crystal_energy.svg/29px-Crystal_energy.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["battery","electricity"],["battery","electricity"]],"members":["battery"],"related":["Off-the-grid","Electricity","Electricity_distribution","Electricity_generation","Grid_energy_storage","Photovoltaic_module","Wind_turbine","Geothermal","Micro_combined_heat_and_power","Micro_hydro","Diesel_generator","Biofuel","Battery_(electricity)","Fuel_cell","Direct_current","Extra_low_voltage","Inverter","Low_voltage","Spain","Photovoltaic","Utility_grid","MPPT","Battery_(electricity)","Wind_turbine","Diesel_engine","Solar_array","Grid-connected_photovoltaic_power_system","List_of_rooftop_photovoltaic_installations","Photovoltaic_power_plant","Building-integrated_photovoltaics","Solar_inverter","Energy_harvesting","Electrochemical_energy_conversion","Microgeneration","Off-the-grid","Rural_electricity","Australian_Greenhouse_Office","Stand-alone_photovoltaic_power_system","World_Bank_Group"]}
