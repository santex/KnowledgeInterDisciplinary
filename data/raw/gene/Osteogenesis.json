{"cursor":"4555","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, IGF) signalling.]] 'Ossification' (or 'osteogenesis') is the process of laying\ndown new bone material by cells called osteoblasts. It is synonymous with bone\ntissue formation. There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal,\nhealthy bone tissue: Intramembranous ossification is the direct\nlaying down of bone into the primitive connective tissue (mesenchyme), while\nendochondral ossification involves cartilage as a precursor. In fracture\nhealing, endochondral osteogenesis is the most commonly occurring process, for\nexample in fractures of long bones treated by plaster of Paris, whereas\nfractures treated by open reduction and stabilization by metal plate and screws\nmay heal by intramembranous osteogenesis.\n\nHeterotopic ossification is a process resulting in the formation of bone tissue\nthat is often atypical, at an extraskeletal location. Calcification is often\nconfused with ossification. Calcification is synonymous with the formation of\ncalcium-based salts and crystals within cells and tissue. It is a process that\noccurs during ossification, but not vice versa.\n\nThe exact mechanisms by which bone development is triggered remains unclear, but\nit involves growth factors and cytokines in some way.\n","linknr":440,"url":"Osteogenesis","recorded":1362511217,"links":46,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Animal physiology","Skeletal system","Tissues|*Ossification"],"headings":["Timetable for human ossification","Evolution","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/Bonemetabolism.svg/300px-Bonemetabolism.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Lepisosteus_oculatus_larva_at_22_days.png/220px-Lepisosteus_oculatus_larva_at_22_days.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Skeleton_woman_back.jpg/15px-Skeleton_woman_back.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Insulin-like_growth_factor","Bone","Osteoblast","Intramembranous_ossification","Mesenchyme","Endochondral_ossification","Cartilage","Fracture_healing","Plaster_of_Paris","Heterotopic_ossification","Calcification","Growth_factor","Cytokines","Scapulae","Os_coxae","Human_sternum","Clavicle","Vertebrae","Cartilage","Vertebrates","Mineral","Exaptation","Dystrophic_calcification","Mechanostat","Ossicone","Osteogenesis_imperfecta","Fibrodysplasia_ossificans_progressiva","Primrose_syndrome"]}
