He\npresented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work [[The Variation of\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication]] and felt that it brought 'together a\nmultitude of facts which are at present left disconnected by any efficient\ncause'. The etymology of the word comes from the Greek words pan (a prefix\nmeaning \"whole\", \"encompassing\") and genesis (\"birth\") or genos (\"origin\"). The\nhypothesis was eventually replaced by Mendel's laws of inheritance.\n\nMuch of Darwin's pangenesis theory was speculatively based on inheritance of\ntiny heredity particles he called gemmules that could be transmitted from parent\nto offspring. Darwin emphasized that only cells could regenerate new tissues or\ngenerate new organisms. He posited that atomic sized gemmules formed by cells\nwould diffuse and aggregate in the reproductive organs.\n","linknr":173,"url":"Pangenesis","recorded":1362486429,"links":29,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://jay.up.poznan.pl/JAG/pdfy/2009_Volume_50/2009_Volume_50_3-177-184.pdf","http://jay.up.poznan.pl/JAG/pdfy/2009_Volume_50/2009_Volume_50_3-177-184.pdf"],"categories":["Charles Darwin","Evolutionary biology","Developmental biology","History of biology","History of ideas","Genetics"],"headings":["Overview","Later elaboration","Galton's experiments on rabbits","See also","References","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["regeneration","biology"]],"members":["regeneration"],"related":["Charles_Darwin","Heredity","Greek_language","Mendelian_inheritance","Gemmules","Developmental_biology","Regeneration_(biology)","Lamarkism","Inheritance_of_acquired_characters","August_Weismann","Phenotypic_plasticity","Sexual_selection","Francis_Galton","Lamarckism"]}
