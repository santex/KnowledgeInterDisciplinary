{"cursor":"2073","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Not to be confused with the evolutionary concept of a [[transitional fossil]].\n\n\n\nIn genetics, a 'transition' is a point mutation that changes a purine nucleotide\nto another purine (A â G) or a pyrimidine nucleotide to another pyrimidine (C â\nT). Approximately two out of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are\ntransitions.\n\nTransitions can be caused by oxidative deamination and tautomerization. [ht-\ntp://www.mun.ca/biochem/courses/3107/Topics/Mutations.html Mutations & Mutagenesis ] Although there are twice as many possible\ntransversions, transitions appear more often in genomes, possibly due to the\nmolecular mechanisms that generate them.\n\n5-Methylcytosine is more prone to transition than unmethylated cytosine, due to\nspontaneous deamination. This mechanism is important because it dictates the rarity of CpG islands.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Transition_(genetics)","recorded":1362484032,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mutation"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Transitions-transversions-v3.png/300px-Transitions-transversions-v3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Point_mutation","Purine","Adenine","Guanine","Pyrimidine","Cytosine","Thymine","Single_nucleotide_polymorphism","Oxidative_deamination","Tautomerization","Transversions","5-Methylcytosine","Cytosine","Deamination","CpG_islands","Transversion"]}
