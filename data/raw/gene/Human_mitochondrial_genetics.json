The 'human\nmitochondrial genome' is the entirety of hereditary information contained in\nhuman mitochondria. Mitochondria are small structures in cells that generate\nenergy for the cell to use, and are hence referred to as the \"powerhouses\"\nof the cell.\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not transmitted through nuclear DNA (nDNA). In\nhumans, as in most multicellular organisms, mitochondrial DNA is inherited only\nfrom the mother's ovum. There are theories, however, that paternal mtDNA\ntransmission in humans can occur in certain circumstances.\n\nMitochondrial inheritance is therefore non-Mendelian, as Mendelian inheritance\npresumes that half the genetic material of a fertilized egg (zygote) derives\nfrom each parent.\n\nEighty percent of mitochondrial DNA codes for functional mitochondrial proteins,\nand therefore most mitochondrial DNA mutations lead to functional problems,\nwhich may be manifested as muscle disorders (myopathies).\n\nBecause they provide 30 molecules of ATP per glucose molecule in contrast to the\n2 ATP molecules produced by glycolysis, mitochondria are essential to all higher\norganisms for sustaining life. The mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders\ncarried in mitochondrial DNA, or nuclear DNA coding for mitochondrial\ncomponents. Slight problems with any one of the numerous enzymes used by the\nmitochondria can be devastating to the cell, and in turn, to the organism.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Human_mitochondrial_genetics","recorded":1362484137,"links":21,"instances":["mitochondrial","molecular_biology","dagmar_of_denmark","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Stone.JFS.2001.pdf","http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Stone.JFS.2001.pdf","http://www.mitomap.org/mitomapgenome.pdf","http://www.mitomap.org/mitomapgenome.pdf"],"categories":["Human mitochondrial genetics|"],"headings":["Quantity","Inheritance patterns","Genes","Genetic code variants","Replication, repair, transcription, and translation","Mitochondrial diseases","Use in identification","See also","References","Footnotes"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Mitochondrial_DNA_en.svg/300px-Mitochondrial_DNA_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Mitochondrial.jpg/220px-Mitochondrial.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["mt-tv","mitochondrial"],["promoter","biology"],["primer","molecular_biology"],["alexandra_feodorovna","alix_of_hesse"],["alexandra_feodorovna","alix_of_hesse#identification_of_remains"],["maria_feodorovna","dagmar_of_denmark"]],"members":["primer","maria_feodorovna","promoter","alexandra_feodorovna","cell"],"related":["Genetics","DNA","Mitochondria","Mitochondrial_DNA","Nuclear_DNA","Ovum","Paternal_mtDNA_transmission_in_humans","Non-Mendelian_inheritance","Mendelian_inheritance","Zygote","Genetic_code","Myopathy","Glycolysis","Mitochondrial_disease","Genetic_disorder","Base_pair","Cell_(biology)","Nuclear_DNA","Mitochondrial_disease","Mendelian_inheritance","Heteroplasmy","Wildtype","Threshold_expression","Paternal_mtDNA_transmission","Electron_transport_chain","NADH_dehydrogenase","MT-ND1","MT-ND2","MT-ND3","MT-ND4","MT-ND4L","MT-ND5","MT-ND6","Coenzyme_Q_-_cytochrome_c_reductase","Cytochrome_b","MT-CYB","Cytochrome_c_oxidase","MT-CO1","MT-CO2","MT-CO3","ATP_synthase","MT-ATP6","MT-ATP8","RRNA","MT-RNR1","MT-RNR2","TRNA","Alanine","MT-TA","Arginine","MT-TR","Asparagine","MT-TN","Aspartic_acid","MT-TD","Cysteine","MT-TC","Glutamic_acid","MT-TE","Glutamine","MT-TQ","Glycine","MT-TG","Histidine","MT-TH","Isoleucine","MT-TI","Leucine","MT-TL1","MT-TL2","Lysine","MT-TK","Methionine","MT-TM","Phenylalanine","MT-TF","Proline","MT-TP","Serine","MT-TS1","MT-TS2","Threonine","MT-TT","Tryptophan","MT-TW","Tyrosine","MT-TY","Valine","MT-TV_(mitochondrial)","Genetic_code","Stop_codon","Tryptophan","Isoleucine","Methionine","Endosymbiotic_theory","Aerobic_organism","Prokaryote","Symbiosis","Anaerobic_organism","Eukaryote","Promoter_(biology)","Primer_(molecular_biology)","POLRMT","POLRMT","In_vitro","POLG","Heavy_strand","Light_strand","Origin_of_replication","D-loop_replication","Mitochondrial_fission","Chromosomal_crossover","Binary_fission","Free_radicals","Parkinson's_disease","Alzheimer's_disease","Coronary_heart_disease","Porphyrin","Oocyte","Mitochondrial_disease","Personalized_medicine","MtDNA","Heteroplasmy","Diabetes_mellitus","Cancer","Cardiovascular_disease","Lactic_acidosis","Myopathy","Osteoporosis","Alzheimer's_disease","Parkinson_disease","Stroke","Male_infertility","Aging","Circumstantial_evidence","Missing_person","United_States","Jesse_James","Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)","Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh","Princess_Victoria_of_Hesse_and_by_Rhine","Nicholas_II_of_Russia","James_Carnegie,_3rd_Duke_of_Fife","Alexandra_of_Denmark","Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)","Paternal_mtDNA_transmission","Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroups","Cambridge_Reference_Sequence","Human_mitochondrial_molecular_clock"]}
