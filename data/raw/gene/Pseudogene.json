Pseudogenes often result from the accumulation of\nmultiple mutations within a gene whose product is not required for the survival\nof the organism.\n\nAlthough some do not have introns or promoters (these pseudogenes are copied\nfrom mRNA and incorporated into the chromosome and are called processed\npseudogenes), most have some gene-like features such as promoters,\nCpG islands, and splice sites. They are nonetheless considered nonfunctional due\nto a lack of protein-coding ability resulting from a variety of disabling\nmutations (e.g. premature stop codons or frameshifts), a lack of transcription,\nor their inability to encode RNA (such as with rRNA pseudogenes). The term was\ncoined in 1977 by Jacq et al.\n\nBecause pseudogenes are generally thought of as the last stop for genomic\nmaterial that is to be removed from the genome, they are\noften labeled as junk DNA. We can define a pseudogene operationally as a\nfragment of nucleotide sequence that resembles a known protein's domains but\nwith stop codons or frameshifts mid-domain. Nonetheless, pseudogenes contain\nfascinating biological and evolutionary histories within their sequences. This\nis due to a pseudogene's shared ancestry with a functional gene: in the same way\nthat Darwin thought of two species as possibly having a shared common ancestry\nfollowed by millions of years of evolutionary divergence (see speciation), a\npseudogene and its associated functional gene also share a common ancestor and\nhave diverged as separate genetic entities over millions of years.\n","linknr":598,"url":"Pseudogene","recorded":1362483460,"links":35,"instances":["biology","biology","biology","biology","genetics","genetics","genetics","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Genetics","Genes"],"headings":["Properties","Types and origin","Potential function","Gene resurrection","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Pseudogene_illustration.pdf/page1-400px-Pseudogene_illustration.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["promotor","biology"],["promotor","biology"],["splicing","genetics"],["function","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["homology","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["splicing","genetics"],["promotor","biology"],["fitness","biology"],["homology","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["promotor","biology"]],"members":["fitness","promotor","homology","function","splicing","translation","transcription","cell"],"related":["Gene","Protein","Gene_expression","Cell_(biology)","Mutations","Intron","Promotor_(biology)","MRNA","Chromosome","Promotor_(biology)","CpG_island","Splicing_(genetics)","Function_(biology)","Stop_codon","Frameshift","Transcription_(genetics)","RRNA","Junk_DNA","Nucleic_acid_sequence","Evolution","Charles_Darwin","Common_ancestor","Speciation","Homology_(biology)","DNA","Sequence_alignment","Base_pair","Convergent_evolution","Transcription_(genetics)","Pre-mRNA_processing","Translation_(genetics)","Protein_folding","Stop_codon","Frameshift_mutation","RNA","Transposable_element","Eukaryote","Mammal","Human_genome","Retrotransposons","Messenger_RNA","Reverse_transcription","Polyadenylation","Splicing_(genetics)","CDNA","Promotor_(biology)","Alternative_splicing","Gene_duplication","Mutation","Exon","Intron","Fitness_(biology)","Selection_pressure","Redundancy","Genetic_model","Genome_analysis","Genetic_drift","Population_bottleneck","Natural_selection","L-gulonolactone_oxidase","Ascorbic_acid","Caspase_12","Nonsense_mutation","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Genome","Gene_prediction","Algorithm","Drosophila","Retrotransposed","Trans-acting","Homology_(biology)","RING_finger_domain","Ubiquitin_ligase","SiRNA","Transcription_(genetics)","Promotor_(biology)","Open_reading_frame","Evolutionary_pressure","Lesions","Gene_conversion","Seminal_RNase","Gene_conversion","Olfactory_receptors","Metazoan","Primate","Evolution","Aroma_compound","Immunoglobulin","Paleontology","Data_mining","Annotation","Human_genome","Ribonuclease","Enzyme","Olfactory_receptor","Yeast","Cytochrome","Ribosomal_protein","Intergenic_region","ENCODE","Oocyte","Small_interfering_RNA","Gene_expression","Human_disabled_pseudogenes_list","Molecular_evolution","Retrotransposon","Retroposon"]}
