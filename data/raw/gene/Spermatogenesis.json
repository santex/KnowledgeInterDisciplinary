The primary\nspermatocyte divides into two secondary spermatocytes; each secondary\nspermatocyte then divides into two spermatids. These develop into mature\nspermatozoa, also known as sperm cells. Thus, the primary spermatocyte gives\nrise to two cells, the secondary spermatocytes, and the two secondary\nspermatocytes by their subdivision produce four spermatozoa.\n\nSpermatozoa are the mature male gametes in many sexually reproducing organisms.\nThus, spermatogenesis is the male version of gametogenesis. In mammals it occurs\nin the male testes and epididymis in a stepwise fashion, and for humans takes\napproximately 64 days. Spermatogenesis is highly dependent upon\noptimal conditions for the process to occur correctly, and is essential for\nsexual reproduction. DNA methylation and histone modification have been\nimplicated in the regulation of this process. It starts at puberty\nand usually continues uninterrupted until death, although a slight decrease can\nbe discerned in the quantity of produced sperm with increase in age (see Male\ninfertility). The entire process can be broken up into several distinct stages,\neach corresponding to a particular type of cell in human:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| 'Cell type' || '[[ploidy]]/[[chromosomes]] in human' || 'DNA copy\n| number/[[chromatids]] in human' || 'Process entered by cell'\n|- spermatogonium (types Ad, Ap and B) || diploid (2N) / 46 || 2C / 46 ||\n|  spermatocytogenesis (mitosis)\n|- primary spermatocyte || diploid (4N) / 46 || 4C / 46 || spermatidogenesis\n|  (meiosis 1)\n|- two secondary spermatocytes || haploid (N) / 23 || 2C / 46 ||\n|  spermatidogenesis (meiosis 2)\n|- four spermatids || haploid (N) / 23 || 1C / 23 || spermiogenesis\n|- four functional spermatozoids || haploid (N) / 23 || 1C / 23 || spermiation\n|-\n| || colspan=\"2\" | Ploidy and chromosome counts are for one cell in\n| || G 1, prior to DNA synthesis and division\n|}\n\n]]\n","linknr":431,"url":"Spermatogenesis","recorded":1362481166,"links":50,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/3/304.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/26/3/304.pdf"],"categories":["Developmental biology","Animal physiology","Mammal male reproductive system"],"headings":["Purpose","Location","Stages","Role of Sertoli cells","Influencing factors","Hormonal control","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Seminiferous_tubule_and_sperm.jpg/220px-Seminiferous_tubule_and_sperm.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Simplified_spermatozoon_diagram.svg/500px-Simplified_spermatozoon_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Spermatocytogenesis.png/250px-Spermatocytogenesis.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Germinal_epithelium_testicle.svg/250px-Germinal_epithelium_testicle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conception","biology"]],"members":["conception"],"related":["Spermatogonia","Meiosis","Spermatozoa","Spermatocytes","Spermatids","Sperm","Gamete","Gametogenesis","Mammal","Testes","Epididymis","Sexual_reproduction","DNA_methylation","Histone_modification","Puberty","Male_infertility","Spermatogonium","Spermatocytogenesis","Mitosis","Spermatocyte","Spermatidogenesis","Meiosis","Spermatocyte","Spermatidogenesis","Meiosis","Spermatid","Spermiogenesis","Spermatozoid","Oocyte","Conception_(biology)","Zygote","Sexual_reproduction","Chromosome","Haploid","Diploid","Species","Down_Syndrome","Klinefelter's_Syndrome","Spontaneous_abortion","Male_reproductive_system","Epididymis","Ejaculation","Seminiferous_tubule","Gametocytogenesis","Spermatocyte","Spermatogonium","Mitosis","Spermatocyte","Adluminal_compartment","Spermatocyte","Haploid","Spermatids","Chromosomal_crossover","Spermatid","Mitochondrium","Axoneme","DNA","Protamine","Chromatin","Golgi_apparatus","Acrosome","Centriole","Cytoplasm","Organelles","Phagocytosed","Testes","Sertoli_cell","Seminiferous_tubule","Epididymis","Peristalsis","Male_reproductive_system","Blood-testis_barrier","Androgen-binding_protein","Testosterone","Inhibin","Antimullerian_hormone","Hormone","Androgen_binding_protein","Leydig_cell","Scrotum","Celsius","Man","Mouse","Cremaster_muscle","Dartos","Anabolic_steroids","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","Hypothalamus","Pituitary_gland","Leydig_cell","Follicle_stimulating_hormone","Testosterone","Androgen_binding_protein","Blood-testis_barrier","Androgen_binding_protein","Apoptosis","Estradiol","Inhibin","Estradiol","Anisogamy","Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction","Folliculogenesis","Germ_cells","Male_infertility","Meiosis","Oogenesis","Oncofertility","Origin_and_function_of_meiosis","Sertoli_cells","Sexual_reproduction","Sperm_count"]}
