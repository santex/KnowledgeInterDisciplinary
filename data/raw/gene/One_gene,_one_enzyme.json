The concept was\nproposed by George Beadle and Edward Tatum in an influential 1941 paper {{Cite journal |author=Beadle GW, Tatum EL |date = 15\nNovember 1941 |title = Genetic Control of Biochemical Reactions in Neurospora\n|url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1078370/ |journal = PNAS\n|volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 499â506 |doi=10.1073/pnas.27.11.499\n|pmc=1078370 |pmid=16588492 |bibcode = 1941PNAS...27..499B }} on genetic\nmutations in the mold [[Neurospora crassa]], and subsequently was dubbed the\n\"one gene-one enzyme hypothesis\" by their collaborator Norman Horowitz. Fruton, p. 434 It is often considered the first\nsignificant result in what came to be called molecular biology. Morange, p.\n21 Although it has been extremely influential, the hypothesis was\nrecognized soon after its proposal to be an oversimplification. Even the\nsubsequent reformulation of the \"one gene-one polypeptide\" hypothesis is now\nconsidered too simple to describe the relationship between genes and\nproteins. {{cite journal |author=Bussard AE |year=2005 |title=A scientific\nrevolution?
