{"cursor":"21381","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":", a beta-glucan polysaccharide.]]\n\n'Polysaccharides' are long carbohydrate molecules of repeated monomer units\njoined together by glycosidic bonds. They range in structure from linear to\nhighly branched. Polysaccharides are often quite heterogeneous, containing\nslight modifications of the repeating unit. Depending on the structure, these\nmacromolecules can have distinct properties from their monosaccharide building\nblocks. They may be amorphous or even insoluble in water.\n\nWhen all the monosaccharides in a polysaccharide are the same type, the\npolysaccharide is called a homopolysaccharide or homoglycan, but when more than\none type of monosaccharide is present they are called heteropolysaccharides or\nheteroglycans.\n\nExamples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen, and\nstructural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin.\n\nPolysaccharides have a general formula of\nC x(H 2O) y where x is usually a large number\nbetween 200 and 2500. Considering that the repeating units in the polymer\nbackbone are often six-carbon monosaccharides, the general formula can also be\nrepresented as (C 6H 10 O5 )n where\n40â¤nâ¤3000.\n","linknr":589,"url":"Polysaccharides","recorded":1362512488,"links":73,"instances":["biology","genetics","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Energy/339-421.pdf","http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Energy/339-421.pdf","http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/129/1/141.pdf"],"categories":["Polysaccharides|","Carbohydrate chemistry"],"headings":["Structure","Function","Storage polysaccharides","Structural polysaccharides","Acidic polysaccharides","Bacterial capsular polysaccharides","Chemical Identification tests for polysaccharides","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Cellulose-Ibeta-from-xtal-2002-3D-balls.png/250px-Cellulose-Ibeta-from-xtal-2002-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Amylose_3Dprojection.corrected.png/350px-Amylose_3Dprojection.corrected.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Glycogen_structure.svg/300px-Glycogen_structure.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Glycogen_spacefilling_model.jpg/300px-Glycogen_spacefilling_model.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","biology"],["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["function","transcription","cell"],"related":["Beta-glucan","Polymer","Carbohydrate","Monomer","Glycosidic_bond","Macromolecule","Amorphous","Insoluble","Starch","Glycogen","Cellulose","Chitin","Monosaccharide","Aldehyde","Ketone","Hydroxyl","Carbon","Atom","Functional_group","Glucose","Fructose","Glyceraldehyde","Polymer","Glucose","Starch","Amylopectin","Glycosidic_bond","Polymer","Function_(biology)","Starch","Amylose","Amylopectin","Glycogen","Cellulose","Chitin","Cell_wall","Viscose","Nitrogen","Arthropod","Exoskeleton","Fungi","Surgical_thread","Callose","Laminarin","Chrysolaminarin","Xylan","Arabinoxylan","Mannan","Fucoidan","Galactomannan","Chitin","Arabinoxylans","Ruminant","Termite","Cellulose","Dietary_fiber","Gastrointestinal_tract","Bile_acids","Cholesterol","Short-chain_fatty_acid","Starches","Glucose","Glucopyranose","Amylose","Amylopectin","Insoluble","Water","Hydrolysis","Amylase","Potato","Rice","Wheat","Maize","Glucose","Glucose","Molecule","Animal","Fungi","Adipose_tissue","Liver","Muscle","Glycogenesis","Brain","Stomach","Starch","Plant","Amylopectin","Cytosol","Cell_(biology)","Glucose_cycle","Energy","Triglycerides","Hepatocyte","Muscle","Concentration","Muscles","Liver","Red_blood_cells","Basal_metabolic_rate","Intermittent_fasting","Kidney","Glial","Brain","White_blood_cells","Arabinoxylan","Pentose","Arabinose","Xylose","Plant","Cellulose","Lignin","Paper","Cotton","Polymer","Termite","Chitin","Polymers","Exoskeleton","Enzyme","Chitinase","Bacteria","Fungi","Chemoreceptors","Sugars","Enzyme","Glycosidic_bond","Ammonia","Chitosan","Cellulose","Glucose","Pectin","Carboxyl_group","Sulfur","Ester","Pathogenic_bacteria","Antigen","Protein","Molecular_weight","Atomic_mass_unit","Monosaccharide","Escherichia_coli","Conjugate_vaccine","Vaccine","Fungi","Algae","Xanthan_gum","Dextran","Pullulan","Shear_thinning","Ecology","Physiology","Cell_wall","Biofilm","Nucleotide","Nucleotide_sugar","Organism","Lipopolysaccharide","Metabolic_pathway","Exopolysaccharide","Rhamnolipid","Transcription_(genetics)","Protein_glycosylation","Pilin","Flagellin","Periodic_acid-Schiff_stain","Mucin","Glycan","Oligosaccharide_nomenclature","Polysaccharide_encapsulated_bacteria"]}
