The assay's purpose is to identify the tropism of an individual\npatient's HIV strain â R5, X4, or a combination of these known as dual/mixed\n(D/M). The results show whether the patient is infected with virus that enters\ncells using the R5 co-receptor, the X4 co-receptor, or both (dual/mixed).\n\nPatients with strains of HIV that prefer the R5 receptor tend to remain\nhealthy longer than those with the strains that prefer X4. However, over the\ncourse of the disease, a patient's viral population may undergo a \"tropism\nswitch\" from R5 to X4.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Trofile_assay","recorded":1362481381,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["HIV/AIDS","Virology"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Diagram_human_cell_nucleus_no_text.png/30px-Diagram_human_cell_nucleus_no_text.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["HIV_tropism","HIV","Assay","Monogram_Biosciences","HIV","HIV_tropism","CCR5","CXCR4"]}
