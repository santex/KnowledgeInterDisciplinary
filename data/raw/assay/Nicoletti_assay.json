{"cursor":"8321","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Cell cycle analysis' is a method in cell biology that employs flow cytometry to\ndistinguish cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Before analysis, the\ncells are and treated with a fluorescent dye that stains DNA quantitatively,\nusually propidium iodide (PI). The fluorescence intensity of the stained cells\nat certain wavelengths will therefore correlate with the amount of DNA they\ncontain. As the DNA content of cells duplicates during the S phase of the cell\ncycle, the relative amount of cells in the G 0 phase and G 1\nphase (before S phase), in the S phase, and in the G 2 phase and M\nphase (after S phase) can be determined, as the fluorescence of cells in the\nG 2/M phase will be twice as high as that of cells in the\nG 0/G 1 phase.\n\nCell cycle anomalies can be symptoms for various kinds of cell damage, for\nexample DNA damage, which cause the cell to interrupt the cell cycle at certain\ncheckpoints to prevent transformation into a cancer cell (carcinogenesis). Other\npossible reasons for anomalies include lack of nutrients, for example after\nserum deprivation.\n\nCell cycle analysis was first described in 1969 at Los Alamos Scientific\nLaboratory by a group from the University of California, {{cite journal\n| author = Van Dilla MA, Trujillo TT, Mullaney PF, Coulter JR date = 14 March\n| 1969 title = Cell Microfluorometry: A Method for Rapid Fluorescence\n| Measurement journal = Science volume = 163 issue = 3872 pages = 1213â1214 pmid\n| = 5812751 doi = 10.1126/science.163.3872.1213\n}}  using the Feulgen staining technique.
