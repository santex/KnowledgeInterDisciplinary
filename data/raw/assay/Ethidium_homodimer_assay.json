Because\nof this, ethidium homodimer may enter those cells and bind to DNA within those\ncells. Because live cells don't have a compromised membrane, the ethidium\nhomodimer can't enter.\n\nOne reason for doing an ethidium homodimer assay instead of using a TUNEL assay\nto measure cell death is that ethidium homodimer stains all of the dead or dying\ncells, while TUNEL only stains cells that have undergone programmed cell death.\n","linknr":73,"url":"Ethidium_homodimer_assay","recorded":1362481335,"links":10,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Laboratory techniques"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ethidium","Fluorescent","DNA","UV-light","Plasma_membrane","TUNEL_assay"]}
