{"cursor":"8471","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'electrophoretic mobility shift assay' (EMSA) or 'mobility shift\nelectrophoresis', also referred as a 'gel shift assay', 'gel mobility shift\nassay', 'band shift assay', or 'gel retardation assay', is a common affinity\nelectrophoresis technique used to study proteinâDNA or proteinâRNA interactions.\nThis procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of\nbinding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than\none protein molecule is involved in the binding complex. Gel shift assays are\noften performed in vitro concurrently with DNase footprinting, primer extension,\nand promoter-probe experiments when studying transcription initiation, DNA\nreplication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation. Although precursors\ncan be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods\ndescribed by Garner and Revzin  and Fried and Crothers.\n","linknr":157,"url":"Gel_shift_assay","recorded":1362481304,"links":19,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":["http://www.activemotif.com/documents/1680.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular genetics","Molecular biology","Protein methods","Proteomics","Analytical chemistry","Laboratory techniques","Electrophoresis","Biological techniques and tools"],"headings":["Principle","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Gel_shift_assay.png/220px-Gel_shift_assay.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Affinity_electrophoresis","Protein–DNA_interaction","Protein","RNA","In_vitro","DNase_footprinting","Primer_extension","Transcription_(genetics)","Gel_electrophoresis","Polyacrylamide_gel","Agarose_gel","Gel_electrophoresis","Oligonucleotide","Isotopic_labeling","Fluorescent_marker","Biotinylation","Ethidium_bromide","Streptavidin"]}
