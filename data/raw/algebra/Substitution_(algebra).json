{"cursor":"1886","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn algebra, the operation of 'substitution' can be applied in various contexts\ninvolving formal objects containing symbols (often called variables or\nindeterminates); the operation consists of systematically replacing occurrences\nof some symbol by a given value.\n\nA common case of substitution involves polynomials, where substitution of a\nnumerical value for the indeterminate of a (univariate) polynomial amounts to\nevaluating the polynomial at that value. Indeed this operation occurs so\nfrequently that the notation for polynomials is often adapted to it; instead of\ndesignating a polynomial by a name like P as one would do for other mathematical\nobjects one could define say\n: P(X)=X^5-3X^2+5X-17\nso that substitution for X can be designated by replacement inside \"P(X)\", say\n: P(2)=13 or P(X+1)=X^5+5X^4+10X^3+7X^2+4X-14 .\nSubstitution can however also applied to other kinds of formal objects built\nfrom symbols, for instance elements of free groups. In order for substitution to\nbe defined, one needs an algebraic structure with an appropriate universal\nproperty, that asserts the existence of unique homomorphisms that send\nindeterminates to specific values; the substitution then amounts to finding the\nimage under such a homomorphism.\n\nSubstitution is related to, but not identical to function composition; it is\nalso closely related to Î²-reduction in lambda calculus. In contrast to these\nnotions however, the accent in algebra is on the preservation of algebraic\nstructure by the substitution operation, the fact that substitution gives a\nhomomorphism for the structure at hand (in the case of polynomials, the ring\nstructure).\n","linknr":97,"url":"Substitution_(algebra)","recorded":1362688560,"links":15,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","variable"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebra"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/9/319aa608e3608bb80887a88679791a83.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/6/8/96862c59f57bcd4762827e8ed5408bac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/3/983378e0ed89f7925df56da4ab84a0e0.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg/40px-Rubik%27s_cube_v3.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["variable","mathematics"],["indeterminate","variable"],["ring","mathematics"]],"members":["variable","ring","indeterminate"],"related":["Algebra","Variable_(mathematics)","Indeterminate_(variable)","Polynomial","Free_group","Universal_property","Function_composition","Lambda_calculus","Homomorphism","Ring_(mathematics)"]}
