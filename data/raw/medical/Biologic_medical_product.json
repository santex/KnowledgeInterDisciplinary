{"cursor":"15195","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'biologic medical product', also known as a 'biological product', or more\nsimply as a 'biologic' or 'biological', is a medicinal product such as a\nvaccine, blood or blood component, allergenic, somatic cell, gene therapy,\ntissue, recombinant therapeutic protein, or living cells that are used as\ntherapeutics to treat diseases. Biologics are created by\nbiologic processes, rather than being chemically synthesized.\n\nBiologics can be composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex\ncombinations of these substances, or may be living entities such as cells and\ntissues. Biologics are isolated from a variety of natural sources â human,\nanimal, or microorganism â and may be produced by biotechnology methods and\nother technologies. Gene-based and cellular biologics, for example, often are at\nthe forefront of biomedical research, and may be used to treat a variety of\nmedical conditions for which no other treatments are available.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, biologics are regulated through varied regulatory pathway\nother than small molecule drugs and medical devices.\n","linknr":237,"url":"Biologic_medical_product","recorded":1362508621,"links":25,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-19572.pdf","http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-19572.pdf","http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf","http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/biosimilar/043704en.pdf","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-10-05/pdf/2010-24853.pdf","http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-10-05/pdf/2010-24853.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2003_63/dir_2003_63_en.pdf","http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2003_63/dir_2003_63_en.pdf","http://bio.org/speeches/pubs/er/BiotechGuide.pdf","http://bio.org/speeches/pubs/er/BiotechGuide.pdf","http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/biotech/genbio062001.pdf","http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/biotech/genbio062001.pdf"],"categories":["Pharmacology","Biotechnology products"],"headings":["Major classes","Biosimilars","Regulation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["tissue","biology"]],"members":["tissue"],"related":["Medicinal","Vaccine","Blood","Allergenic","Somatic_cell","Gene_therapy","Tissue_(biology)","Recombinant_protein","Therapeutic","Biology","Chemistry","Whole_blood","Organ_transplantation","Tissue_transplant","Stem_cell_therapy","Passive_immunization","Recombinant_DNA","Erythropoetin","Growth_hormone","Insulin","Monoclonal_antibodies","Hybridoma","Fusion_protein","Immunoglobulin","Pharmacology","Rheumatology","Oncology","Cardiology","Dermatology","Gastroenterology","Neurology","Recombinant_DNA","United_States_Adopted_Name","International_Nonproprietary_Name","Abatacept","Rheumatoid_arthritis","Immunoglobin","CTLA-4","Fusion_protein","T-cell","Adalimumab","Ankylosing_spondylitis","Psoriatic_arthritis","Crohn's_disease","Monoclonal_antibody","Tumor_necrosis_factor-alpha","Receptor_antagonist","Alefacept","Psoriasis","Erythropoietin","Anemia","Chemotherapy","Chronic_renal_failure","Recombinant_protein","Etanercept","Infliximab","Crohn's_disease","Trastuzumab","Breast_cancer","Humanized_antibodies","HER2/neu","Ustekinumab","Psoriasis","Humanized_antibodies","Denileukin_diftitox","Interleukin-2","Viral_gene_therapy","Virus","Small-molecule","Generic_drug","Clone_bank","Insulin","Growth_hormone","Biosimilar","Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act","Patent_cliff","Center_for_Biologics_Evaluation_and_Research","Center_for_Drug_Evaluation_and_Research","Biopharmaceutical","Biosimilar","Antibody-drug_conjugate","Center_for_Biologics_Evaluation_and_Research"]}
