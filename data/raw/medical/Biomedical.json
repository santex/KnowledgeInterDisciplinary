{"cursor":"10821","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n is one of the largest medical research facilities in the United States.]]\n\n, is one of the largest medical schools in Asia|200px|thumb]]\n\n'Biomedical research' (or 'experimental medicine'), in general simply known as\n'medical research', is the basic research, applied research, or translational\nresearch conducted to aid and support the body of knowledge in the field of\nmedicine. Medical research can be divided into two general categories: the\nevaluation of new treatments for both safety and efficacy in what are termed\nclinical trials, and all other research that contributes to the development of\nnew treatments. The latter is termed preclinical research if its goal is\nspecifically to elaborate knowledge for the development of new therapeutic\nstrategies. A new paradigm to biomedical research is being termed translational\nresearch, which focuses on iterative feedback loops between the basic and\nclinical research domains to accelerate knowledge translation from the bedside\nto the bench, and back again. Medical research may involve doing research on\npublic health, biochemistry, clinical research, microbiology, physiology,\noncology, surgery and research on many other non-communicable diseases such as\ndiabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThe increased longevity of humans over the past century can be significantly\nattributed to advances resulting from medical research. Among the major\nbenefits have been vaccines for measles and polio, insulin treatment for\ndiabetes, classes of antibiotics for treating a host of maladies, medication\nfor high blood pressure, improved treatments for AIDS, statins and other\ntreatments for atherosclerosis, new surgical techniques such as microsurgery,\nand increasingly successful treatments for cancer. New, beneficial tests and\ntreatments are expected as a result of the Human Genome Project. Many\nchallenges remain, however, including the appearance of antibiotic resistance\nand the obesity epidemic.\n\nMost of the research in the field is pursued by biomedical scientists, however\nsignificant contributions are made by other biologists, as well as chemists and\nphysicists. Medical research, done on humans, has to strictly follow the medical\nethics as sanctioned in the Declaration of Helsinki and elsewhere. In all cases,\nthe research ethics has to be respected.\n","linknr":539,"url":"Biomedical","recorded":1362501632,"links":31,"instances":["japan","united_states","uk"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Medical research|","Health research","Health sciences"],"headings":["Preclinical research","Clinical  trials","Funding","Regulations and guidelines","Fields of research","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Monoclonal_antibodies4.jpg/250px-Monoclonal_antibodies4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/UF_Cancer_Genetics_Complex.JPG/250px-UF_Cancer_Genetics_Complex.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/AIIMS_central_lawn.jpg/200px-AIIMS_central_lawn.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Wellcome.jpg/250px-Wellcome.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["medical_research_council","uk"],["food_and_drug_administration","united_states"],["ministry_of_health,_labour_and_welfare","japan"]],"members":["food_and_drug_administration","medical_research_council"],"related":["United_States","Basic_research","Applied_research","Translational_research","Medicine","Clinical_trial","Pre-clinical_development","Translational_research","Non-communicable_disease","Vaccine","Measles","Polio","Insulin","Diabetes","Antibiotic","Blood_pressure","AIDS","Statin","Atherosclerosis","Microsurgery","Cancer","Human_Genome_Project","Antibiotic_resistance","Obesity_epidemic","Biomedical_scientist","Biologist","Chemist","Physicist","Human_experimentation","Medical_ethics","Declaration_of_Helsinki","Research_ethics","Basic_science","Animal_experiments","Preclinical_imaging","Penicillin","Medication","Placebo","Multicenter_trial","Research_funding","United_Kingdom","Medical_Research_Council_(UK)","Wellcome_Trust","National_Institutes_of_Health","Pharmaceutical_company","Biotechnology","Medical_devices","Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation","National_Health_and_Medical_Research_Council","Orphan_drug","United_States","Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)","European_Medicines_Agency","EudraLex","Japan","Ministry_of_Health,_Labour_and_Welfare_(Japan)","World_Medical_Association","Declaration_of_Helsinki","International_Conference_on_Harmonisation_of_Technical_Requirements_for_Registration_of_Pharmaceuticals_for_Human_Use","Good_clinical_practice","Public_Health","Epidemiology","Preventive_medicine","Behavioral_health","Cancer","Aging","Endocrinology","Neuroendocrinology","Diabetes","Cellular_biology","Molecular_biology","Pharmacology","Neuroscience","Genetics","Epigenetics","Virology","Tissue_Engineering","Animal_testing","Biomedicine","Biomedical_informatics","Biomedical_scientist","Biomedical_technology","Human_experimentation","Medical_research_scientist","Medical_Scientist_Training_Program","Pharmaceutical_company","Preclinical_imaging","Title_21_of_the_Code_of_Federal_Regulations","Translational_Research"]}
