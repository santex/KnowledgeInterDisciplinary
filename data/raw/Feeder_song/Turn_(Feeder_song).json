It reached #27 in the UK singles charts, and led to\nthe Echo Park album re-entering the top 75 due to the pre-release airplay and\nstocking of the single on release week. It was also the band's third successive\ntop 30 single, the first time this had happened in their career.\n\nThe track called \"Come Back Around\" on CD1 is not the same song as the single\nfrom \"Comfort In Sound\", released a year later but a totally different song.\nWhen \"Come Back Around\" was mentioned as a new single, there was an initial\nconfusion among fans thinking it was a new version of the same song. The title\ntrack related to Grant Nicholas's experiences of being away while on tour.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Turn_(Feeder_song)","recorded":1362892611,"links":14,"instances":["music","album"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Feeder songs"],"headings":["Track listing","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/60/Feederturn.jpg/220px-Feederturn.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["echo_park","album"],["single","music"]],"members":["single","echo_park"],"related":["Feeder","Echo_Park_(album)","Compact_Disc","7\"_single","Alternative_rock","Echo_Records","Gil_Norton","Seven_Days_in_the_Sun","Feeder","Single_(music)","Grant_Nicholas"]}
