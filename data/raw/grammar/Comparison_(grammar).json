The usual degrees of comparison are the 'positive',\nwhich simply denotes a property (as with the English words big and fully); the\n'[[comparative]]', which indicates greater degree (as bigger and more fully);\nand the '[[superlative]]', which indicates greatest degree (as biggest and most\nfully).
