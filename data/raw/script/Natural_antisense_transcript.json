{"cursor":"13146","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are a group of RNAs encoded within a cell\nthat have transcript complementarity to other RNA transcripts. They have been identified in multiple eukaryotes,\nincluding humans, mice, yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana. This class of RNAs includes both protein-coding and\nnon-coding RNAs. Current evidence has suggested a\nvariety of regulatory roles for NATs, such as RNA interference (RNAi),\nalternative splicing, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. NATs are broadly grouped into two categories based\non whether they act in cis or in trans. Trans-\nNATs are transcribed from a different location than their targets and usually\nhave complementarity to multiple transcripts with some mismatches. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are an example of trans-NATs that\ncan target multiple transcripts with a few mismatches.\n'Cis-natural antisense transcripts' (cis-NATs) on the other hand are transcribed\nfrom the same genomic locus as their target but from the opposite DNA strand and\nform perfect pairs.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Natural_antisense_transcript","recorded":1362539257,"links":15,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Antisense RNA"],"headings":["Orientation of cis-NATs","Identification approach","Mechanisms","Importance","Cis-NATs and disease","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/de/Cis-NAT_orientations.jpg/250px-Cis-NAT_orientations.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/40/Transcriptional_Collision_Cis-NATs.jpg/250px-Transcriptional_Collision_Cis-NATs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Cis-Nats_and_cancer.jpg/250px-Cis-Nats_and_cancer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["poly(a_tail"],["promoter","biology"]],"members":["promoter"],"related":["RNA","RNA_interference","Alternative_splicing","Genomic_imprinting","X-inactivation","MicroRNA","MRNA","Expressed_sequence_tag","Poly(A)_tail","DNA_methylation","Histone","Promoter_(biology)","RNA_polymerase","Gene_regulatory_network","Xist","MiRNA","Thalassemia","Hemoglobin","Transposable_element","CpG_island","Oncogene","Tumor_suppressor_gene","Parkinson's_disease"]}
