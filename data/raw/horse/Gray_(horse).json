Most gray\nhorses have black skin and dark eyes; unlike many depigmentation genes, gray\ndoes not affect skin or eye color \"Pigmentation of the skin\nand eyes is not affected by G^G.\" Their adult hair coat is white, dappled,\nor white intermingled with hairs of other colors. Gray horses may be born any\nbase color, depending on other color genes present. White hairs begin to appear\nat or shortly after birth and become progressively lighter as the horse ages.\nGraying can occur at different ratesâvery quickly on one horse and very slowly\non another.\n\nGray horses appear in many breeds, though the color is most commonly seen in\nbreeds descended from Arabian ancestors. Some breeds that have large numbers of\ngray-colored horses include the Thoroughbred, the Arabian, the American Quarter\nHorse, the Percheron, the Andalusian, the Welsh pony, and the most famous of all\ngray horse breeds, the Lipizzaner.\n\nPeople who are unfamiliar with horses may refer to gray horses as \"white.\"\nHowever, a gray horse whose hair coat is completely \"white\" will still have\nblack skin (except under markings that were white at birth) and dark eyes. This\nis how to discern a gray horse from a white horse. White horses usually have\npink skin and sometimes even have blue eyes. Young horses with hair coats\nconsisting of a mixture of colored and gray or white hairs are sometimes\nconfused with roan. Some horses that carry dilution genes may also be confused\nwith white or gray.\n\nWhile gray is commonly called a coat color by breed registries, genetically it\nmay be more correct to call it a depigmentation pattern. It is a dominant\ngene, and thus a horse needs only one copy of the gray\nallele, that is, heterozygous, to be gray in color. A homozygous gray horse, one\ncarrying two gray alleles, will always produce gray foals.\n","linknr":342,"url":"Gray_(horse)","recorded":1362665008,"links":33,"instances":["color","horse","horse","horse","color","coat"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Horse coat colors"],"headings":["Prevalence","Changes in the color of gray horses","The genetics of gray","Horse coat colors sometimes confused with gray","Mythology","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Lipizzaner_DSC02439.jpg/220px-Lipizzaner_DSC02439.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Andalusier_3_-_galoppierend.jpg/220px-Andalusier_3_-_galoppierend.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Stutemitfohlen.jpg/220px-Stutemitfohlen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Julgamento_%C3%81rabe_REFON_.jpg/220px-Julgamento_%C3%81rabe_REFON_.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Mangalarga_Marchador.jpg/220px-Mangalarga_Marchador.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Asil_Arabian_Mare_AC2008_0001.jpg/220px-Asil_Arabian_Mare_AC2008_0001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Mustangs.jpg/150px-Mustangs.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bay","color"],["black","horse"],["white","horse"],["white","horse"],["roan","horse"],["bay","color"],["chestnut","coat"],["black","horse"],["white","horse"],["roan","horse"],["white","horse"],["white","horse"],["roan","horse"],["dun","color"],["black","horse"],["white","horse"],["white","horse"]],"members":["bay","roan","white","black","dun","chestnut"],"related":["Bay_(color)","Black_(horse)","White_(horse)","Sabino_horse","Equine_coat_color","Horse","List_of_horse_breeds","Arabian_horse","Thoroughbred","Arabian_horse","American_Quarter_Horse","Percheron","Andalusian_horse","Welsh_pony","Lipizzaner","Horse_markings","White_(horse)","Roan_(horse)","Dilution_gene","Breed_registry","Dominance_relationship","Allele","Heterozygous","Homozygous","Lipizzaner","Andalusian_horse","Percheron","Boulonnais_horse","Welsh_Pony","Thoroughbred","American_Quarter_Horse","Arabian_horse","Pinto_horse","Appaloosa","Color_breed","Foal","Foal","Foal","Bay_(color)","Chestnut_(coat)","Black_(horse)","White_(horse)","Horse_markings","Pinto_horse","Dilution_gene","Roan_(horse)","Sabino_horse","Bedouin","Arabian_horse","Rabicano","Dominant_gene","Allele","Homozygous","Allele","Heterozygous","Recessive_gene","White_(horse)","Allele","Gene","Stem_cell","Melanoma","Malignant_melanoma","White_(horse)","Cream_gene","Roan_(horse)","Rabicano","Varnish_roan","Appaloosa","Leopard_complex","Dilution_gene","Dun_(color)","Grullo","Dun_gene","Cream_gene","Pearl_gene","Champagne_gene","Silver_dapple_gene","Black_(horse)","White_(horse)","Uchaishravas","Sleipnir","University_of_California","Albinism","Equine_coat_color","Equine_coat_color_genetics","White_(horse)"]}
