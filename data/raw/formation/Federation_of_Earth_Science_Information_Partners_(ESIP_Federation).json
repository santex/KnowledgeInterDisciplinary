Partners\nutilize these neutral forums for knowledge exchange and collaborationâan\nintellectual commons of sortsâwhere practitioners solve common problems. This\ncommunity-based approach is discipline neutral, with IT supporting science by\nimproving discovery, access, integration and interoperability.\n\nInitially created by NASA in 1998, the ESIP Federation was formed in response to\na National Research Council recommendation calling for the involvement of\ncommunity stakeholders in the development of NASAâs EOSDIS as a critical element\nof the U.S. Global Change Research Program\n(http://www.gcrio.org/USGCRP/LaJolla/cover.html). Since its inception, theESIP\nFederation has continually grown and attracted a diverse group of partners, now\nincluding more than 125 member organizations. The ESIP Federationâs membership\nis broad, including federal data centers, government research laboratories,\nresearch universities, education resource providers, technology developers, and\nvarious nonprofit and commercial enterprises.\n\nSince it is community-driven, the ESIP Federation is an independent forum for\naddressing topics of interest to many in the Earth science data and technology\ncommunity. Participation in the ESIP Federation is open to organizations that\ncare about Earth science data and who wish to work across communities to expose,\ngather and enhance in-house capabilities in support of their organizationâs own\ndata management programs that promote their broader agency mission.\n","linknr":134,"url":"Federation_of_Earth_Science_Information_Partners_(ESIP_Federation)","recorded":1362268029,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://wiki.esipfed.org/images/9/95/StrategicPlan_2009-2013_FINAL.pdf"],"categories":["Earth sciences"],"headings":["History","Partners","Interests","Current activities","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Information_technology","Interoperability","Earth_science","Collaboration","Knowledge_exchange","NASA","United_States_National_Research_Council","EOSDIS","U.S._Global_Change_Research_Program","Data_management","Environmental_science","Earth_observation","Research","Education","Prototype","Internet","Virtual_organization","Non-profit_corporation","Memorandum_of_understanding","Data_center","Infrastructure","Madison,_Wisconsin","NOAA","USGS","Data_steward","Information_quality","Data_visualization","Climate_change","Environmental_Protection_Agency","State_school"]}
