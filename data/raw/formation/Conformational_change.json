{"cursor":"3096","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA macromolecule is usually flexible and dynamic. It can change its shape in\nresponse to changes in its environment or other factors; each possible shape is\ncalled a conformation, and a transition between them is called a 'conformational\nchange'. A macromolecular conformational change may be induced by many factors\nsuch as a change in temperature, pH, voltage, ion concentration,\nphosphorylation, or the binding of a ligand.\n\nMany biophysical techniques such as crystallography, NMR, electron paramagnetic\nresonance (EPR) using Spin label techniques, Circular Dichroism (CD), Hydrogen\nExchange, and FRET can be used to study macromolecular conformational change.\nDual Polarisation Interferometry is a benchtop technique capable of measuring\nconformational changes in biomolecules in real time at very high resolution.\n\nA specific nonlinear optical technique called second-harmonic generation (SHG)\nhas been recently applied to the study of conformational change in proteins. In\nthis method, a second-harmonic-active probe is placed at a site that undergoes\nmotion in the protein by mutagenesis or non-site-specific attachment, and the\nprotein is adsorbed or specifically immobilized to a surface. A change in\nprotein conformation produces a change in the net orientation of the dye\nrelative to the surface plane and therefore the intensity of the second harmonic\nbeam. In a protein sample with a well-defined orientation, the tilt angle of the\nprobe can be quantitatively determined, in real space and real time. Second-harmonic-\nactive unnatural amino acids can also be used as probes.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Conformational_change","recorded":1362509614,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~austin/hf_book/chapter26.pdf"],"categories":["Microbiology techniques"],"headings":["External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Ligand","Crystallography","NMR","Electron_paramagnetic_resonance","Spin_label","FÃ¶rster_resonance_energy_transfer","Dual_Polarisation_Interferometry","Princeton_University","Molmovdb","Protein_dynamics","Database_of_protein_conformational_diversity"]}
