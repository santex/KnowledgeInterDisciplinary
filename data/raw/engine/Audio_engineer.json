{"cursor":"15603","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nAn 'audio engineer', also called 'audio technician', 'audio technologist',\n'recording engineer', 'sound engineer', '[[sound operator]]', or 'sound\ntechnician', is a specialist in a skilled trade that deals with the use of\nmachinery and equipment for the recording, mixing and reproduction of sounds.\nThe field draws on many artistic and vocational areas, including electronics,\nacoustics, psychoacoustics, and music. An audio technician is proficient with\ndifferent types of recording media, such as analog tape, digital multitrack\nrecorders and workstations, and computer knowledge. With the advent of the\ndigital age, it is becoming more and more important for the audio technician to\nbe versed in the understanding of software and hardware integration from\nsynchronization to analog to digital transfers.\n\nAudio engineering concerns the creative and practical aspects of sounds and\nmusic, in contrast with the formal engineering discipline known as acoustical\nengineering. Producer, engineer, mixer Phil Ek has described audio engineering\nas the \"technical aspect of recordingâthe placing of microphones, the turning of\npre-amp knobs, the setting of levels. The physical recording of any project is\ndone by an engineer... the nuts and bolts.\" Many\nrecording engineers also invented new technology, equipment and techniques, to\nenhance the process and art.
