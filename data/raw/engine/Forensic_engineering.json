{"cursor":"14653","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Forensic engineering' is the investigation of materials, products, structures\nor components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing\npersonal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt\nwith by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing\nprocesses and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or\nmachinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it\nmay be of use in criminal law cases. Generally, the purpose of a forensic\nengineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to\nimprove performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining\nthe facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual\nproperty claims, especially patents.\n","linknr":581,"url":"Forensic_engineering","recorded":1362485845,"links":28,"instances":["medicine","common_law","business"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineering disciplines","Materials science","Engineering failures","Forensic disciplines|Engineering"],"headings":["History","Investigation","Analysis","Examples","Applications","Historic examples","Publications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Punuk.Alaska.skulls.jpg/150px-Punuk.Alaska.skulls.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Plate7new.jpg/200px-Plate7new.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/35/Plate4new.jpg/200px-Plate4new.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Broken_fuel_pipe.jpg/200px-Broken_fuel_pipe.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Amide_hydrolysis.svg/512px-Amide_hydrolysis.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Dee_bridge_disaster.jpg/350px-Dee_bridge_disaster.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","business"],["civil_law","common_law"],["implant","medicine"]],"members":["implant","civil_law","product"],"related":["Material_science","Product_(business)","Structure","Personal_injury","Product_liability","Civil_law_(common_law)","Criminal_law","Forensics","Engineering","Accident","Intellectual_property","Patent","Bridge_failure","Tay_Bridge_disaster","Dee_bridge_disaster","Tensile_test","Fractography","Edmond_Locard","Independent_testing_laboratory","Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis","Fault_tree_analysis","Safety_engineering","Failure_rate","Scanning_electron_microscope","Spectroscopy","Infrared","Ultraviolet","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Radiography","X-ray","Neutron","Magnifying_glass","Trace_evidence","Scanning_electron_microscope","Polyoxymethylene_plastic","Stress_corrosion_cracking","Sulfur","Sulfuric_acid","Match_moving","Photogrammetry","Image_rectification","Forensic_materials_engineering","Metal","Glass","Ceramic","Composite_material","Polymer","Diesel_fuel","Lorry","Scanning_electron_microscopy","Nylon","Stress_corrosion_cracking","Battery_acid","Hydrolysis","Sulfuric_acid","Injection_moulded","Nylon&nbsp;6,6","Diesel_fuel","Black_ice","Lubricity","Structural_failure","Rail_crashes","Aviation_accidents_and_incidents","Car_accident","Medical_device","Life-critical_system","Implant_(medicine)","Breast_implant","Heart_valve","Catheter","New_product_development","Accelerated_life_testing","Life-critical_system","Product_recall","Bathtub_curve","ASTM_International","BSI_Group","International_standard","Dee_bridge","Chester","England","Cast_iron","Girder","Wrought_iron","Ruabon","Robert_Stephenson","Inquest","Railway_Inspectorate","Royal_Engineers","Impact_force","Fracture","Eye_witness","Locomotive","Academic_literature","American_Society_of_Civil_Engineers","Car_accident","Catastrophic_failure","Failure_analysis","Forensic_chemistry","Forensic_electrical_engineering","Forensic_evidence","Forensic_materials_engineering","Forensic_photography","Forensic_polymer_engineering","Forensic_Science","Fractography","Stress_analysis","Structural_analysis","Structural_failure","Trace_evidence","Vehicular_accident_reconstruction"]}
