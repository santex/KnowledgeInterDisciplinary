{"cursor":"3776","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Surface engineering' is the sub-discipline of materials science which deals\nwith the surface of solid matter. It has applications to chemistry, mechanical\nengineering, and electrical engineering (particularly in relation to\nsemiconductor manufacturing).\n\nSolids are composed of a bulk material covered by a surface. The surface which\nbounds the bulk material is called the Surface phase. It acts as an interface\nto the surrounding environment. The bulk material in a solid is called the\nBulk phase.\n\nThe surface phase of a solid interacts with the surrounding environment. This\ninteraction can degrade the surface phase over time. Environmental\ndegradation of the surface phase over time can be caused by wear, corrosion,\nfatigue and creep.\n\nSurface engineering involves altering the properties of the Surface Phase in\norder to reduce the degradation over time. This is accomplished by making the\nsurface robust to the environment in which it will be used. A spectrum of topics\nthat represent the diverse nature of the field of surface engineering includes\nPlating technologies, Nano and emerging technologies and Surface engineering,\ncharacterization and testing.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Surface_engineering","recorded":1362509913,"links":13,"instances":["deformation","material"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Engineering disciplines","Surface engineering"],"headings":["Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fatigue","material"],["creep","deformation"]],"members":["creep","fatigue"],"related":["Materials_science","Surface","Chemistry","Mechanical_engineering","Electrical_engineering","Semiconductor_manufacturing","Solids","Surface_phase","Bulk_phase","Environmental_degradation","Wear","Corrosion","Fatigue_(material)","Creep_(deformation)","Surface_finishing","Surface_science","Tribology","Surface_metrology","Research_Publishing_Services"]}
