{"cursor":"12542","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Proteinâprotein interactions' occur when two or more proteins bind together,\noften to carry out their biological function. Many of the most important\nmolecular processes in the cell such as DNA replication are carried out by large\nmolecular machines that are built from a large number of protein components\norganised by their proteinâprotein interactions. Protein interactions have been\nstudied from the perspectives of biochemistry, quantum chemistry, molecular\ndynamics, chemical biology, signal transduction and other metabolic or\ngenetic/epigenetic networks. Indeed, proteinâprotein interactions are at the\ncore of the entire interactomics system of any living cell.\n\nInteractions between proteins are important for the majority of biological\nfunctions. For example, signals from the exterior of a cell are mediated to the\ninside of that cell by proteinâprotein interactions of the signaling molecules.\nThis process, called signal transduction, plays a fundamental role in many\nbiological processes and in many diseases (e.g. cancers). Proteins might\ninteract for a long time to form part of a protein complex, a protein may be\ncarrying another protein (for example, from cytoplasm to nucleus or vice versa\nin the case of the nuclear pore importins), or a protein may interact briefly\nwith another protein just to modify it (for example, a protein kinase will add a\nphosphate to a target protein). This modification of proteins can itself change\nproteinâprotein interactions. For example, some proteins with SH2 domains only\nbind to other proteins when they are phosphorylated on the amino acid tyrosine\nwhile bromodomains specifically recognise acetylated lysines. In conclusion,\nproteinâprotein interactions are of central importance for virtually every\nprocess in a living cell. Information about these interactions improves our\nunderstanding of diseases and can provide the basis for new therapeutic\napproaches.\n","linknr":315,"url":"Protein-protein_interaction","recorded":1362502985,"links":27,"instances":["biology","biology","graph_drawing"],"pdf":["http://generegulation.info/teifpdf/_Teif&Rippe2012_Calculating_transcription_factor_binding_maps_for_chromatin.pdf"],"categories":["Proteomics","Signal transduction","Biophysics","Systems biology","Bioinformatics","Biochemistry methods","Biophysical techniques","Biotechnology","Quantum chemistry|Quantum biochemistry"],"headings":["Methods to investigate protein–protein interactions","Structure","Visualization of networks","Database collections","See also","References","External links","({{NoMoreLinks}})",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/1dfj_RNAseInhibitor-RNAse_complex.jpg/250px-1dfj_RNAseInhibitor-RNAse_complex.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Human_interactome.jpg/200px-Human_interactome.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","biology"],["cell","biology"],["force-based_algorithms","graph_drawing"]],"members":["function","cell"],"related":["Protein","Function_(biology)","DNA_replication","Biochemistry","Quantum_chemistry","Molecular_dynamics","Chemical_biology","Signal_transduction","Graph_theory","Interactomics","Cell_(biology)","Signal_transduction","Cancer","Protein_complex","Cytoplasm","Cell_nucleus","Nuclear_pore","Protein_kinase","SH2_domain","Amino_acid","Bromodomain","Sensitivity_and_specificity","Yeast_two-hybrid","Co-immunoprecipitation","Molecular_structure","X-ray_crystallography","Chemical_bonds","Haemoglobin","Max_Perutz","Insulin","Trypsin","Oxyhaemoglobin","Cyrus_Chothia","Joel_Janin","Conformational_change","Scientific_visualization","Layered_graph_drawing","Force-based_algorithms_(graph_drawing)","Cytoscape","Biological_database","Database_of_interacting_proteins","BioGRID","STRING","ConsensusPathDB","Interactome","Interactomics","Fuzzy_complex","Systems_biology","Protein–protein_interaction_prediction","Protein–protein_interaction_screening"]}
