It is a\nwater soluble enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as\nthose found in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), into two\nfree fatty acids and one monoacylglycerol molecule. It is also involved in\npromoting the cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich\nlipoproteins, and free fatty acids. LPL requires ApoC-II as a cofactor.\n\nLPL is attached to the luminal surface of endothelial cells in capillaries. It\nis most widely distributed in adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle tissue, as\nwell as in lactating mammary glands.\n","linknr":872,"url":"Lipoprotein_lipase","recorded":1362485012,"links":130,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/68/2/296.full.pdf","http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/68/2/296.full.pdf"],"categories":["EC 3.1.1"],"headings":["Synthesis","Structure","Mechanism","Function","Regulation","Pathology","Interactions","Interactive pathway map","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/PBB_GE_LPL_203549_s_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_LPL_203549_s_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/PBB_GE_LPL_203548_s_at_tn.png/250px-PBB_GE_LPL_203548_s_at_tn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/LPL_homodimer.jpg/500px-LPL_homodimer.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/StatinPathway_WP430.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/StatinPathway_WP430.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Lipase","Pancreatic_lipase","Hepatic_lipase","Endothelial_lipase","Enzyme","Hydrolyze","Triglyceride","Lipoprotein","Chylomicron","Very_low_density_lipoprotein","Fatty_acid","Monoacylglycerol","ApoC-II","Endothelium","Capillaries","Parenchymal_cells","Glycosylation","Extracellular_matrix","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Glucosidases","Golgi_apparatus","Oligosaccharides","Crystal_structure","Structural_homology,_protein","N-terminus","Active_site","C-terminus","Alpha/beta_hydrolase_fold","Beta_sheet","Alpha_helix","Oxyanion_hole","LDL","Heparin","Glycerol","Rate-limiting_step","Intermediate-density_lipoprotein","Isozymes","Insulin","Adipocytes","Myocardium","Lipoprotein_lipase_deficiency","Hypertriglyceridemia","Triglyceride","Protein-protein_interaction","LRP1","Î‘2M","GP330","LRP2","ApoC-III"]}
