[http://www.answers.com/topic/prosthetic-group]\nHeme remains bound to the protein permanently, either covalently or\nnoncovalently bound or both.

The iron has six possible coordination\nbonds. The 'porphyrin ring' has 4 nitrogen atoms that bind to the iron, leaving\ntwo other coordination positions of the iron available for bonding to the\nhistidine of the protein and a divalent atom.\n\nHemeproteins probably evolved to incorporate the iron (Fe) atom contained within\nthe protoporphyrin IX ring of heme into proteins. As it makes hemeproteins\nresponsive to molecules that can bind divalent iron (Fe), this strategy has been\nmaintained throughout evolution as it plays crucial physiological functions.\nOxygen (O2) nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)\nbinds to the iron atom in heme proteins. Once bound to the prosthetic heme\ngroups, these molecules can modulate the activity/function of those\nhemeproteins, affording signal transduction. Therefore, when produced in\nbiologic systems (cells), these gaseous molecules are referred to as\ngasotransmitters.\n\nBecause of their diverse range of biological functions, the structural and\nfunctional characterizations of hemeproteins are the most studied classes of\nbiomolecules. Data on heme protein structure and function has been\naggregated into The Heme Protein Database (HPD), a secondary database to the\nProtein Data Bank.
