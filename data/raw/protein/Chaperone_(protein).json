{"cursor":"18408","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"/GroEL bacterial chaperone complex model]] In molecular biology, 'molecular\nchaperones' are proteins that assist the non-covalent folding or unfolding and\nthe assembly or disassembly of other macromolecular structures, but do not occur\nin these structures when the structures are performing their normal biological\nfunctions having completed the processes of folding and/or assembly. The common\nperception that chaperones are concerned primarily with protein folding is\nincorrect. The first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of\nnucleosomes from folded histones and DNA and such assembly chaperones,\nespecially in the nucleus, are concerned with the assembly\nof folded subunits into oligomeric structures.\n\nOne major function of chaperones is to prevent both newly synthesised\npolypeptide chains and assembled subunits from aggregating into nonfunctional\nstructures. It is for this reason that many chaperones, but by no means all, are\nalso heat shock proteins because the tendency to aggregate increases as proteins\nare denatured by stress. In this case, chaperones do not convey any additional\nsteric information required for proteins to fold. However, some highly specific\n'steric chaperones' do convey unique structural (steric) information onto\nproteins, which cannot be folded spontaneously. Such proteins violate Anfinsen's\ndogma.\n","linknr":536,"url":"Chaperone_(protein)","recorded":1362486541,"links":38,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":["http://ultr23.vub.ac.be/ultr/pub/pdfs/290.pdf","http://ultr23.vub.ac.be/ultr/pub/pdfs/290.pdf"],"categories":["Proteins","Protein biosynthesis"],"headings":["Location and functions","Human chaperone proteins","Nomenclature and examples of bacterial and archeal chaperones","History","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/GroES-GroEL_top.png/250px-GroES-GroEL_top.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Chaperonin-1AON.png/500px-Chaperonin-1AON.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["matrix","biology"]],"members":["matrix"],"related":["GroEL","Molecular_biology","Protein","Nucleosome","Histone","DNA","Heat_shock_protein","Steric","Anfinsen's_dogma","Heat_shock_protein","Gene_expression","Protein_folding","Macromolecular_crowding","Cytosol","Protein_aggregation","GroEL","Chaperonin","Biological_membrane","Mitochondria","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Eukaryote","Bacterial","Protein_precursor","Polypeptide_chain","Protein_targeting","Translocon","Protein_degradation","Bacterial_adhesin","Prion","Protein_synthesis","BiP","GRP94","GRP170","Calnexin","Calreticulin","HSP47","ERp29","Protein_disulfide_isomerase","ERp57","Heat_shock_protein","GroEL","Hydrophobic","Green_fluorescent_protein","GroES","Matrix_(biology)","Hsp70","Apoptosis","Adenosine_diphosphate","Adenosine_triphosphate","Hsp90","Protein_domain","Protein_dimer","Co-chaperone","Immunophilin","STIP1","Cdc37","Aha1","Nanometer","Serine_protease","Saccharomyces_cerevisiae","Yeast_prions","Prions","Ron_Laskey","Nucleoplasmin","R._John_Ellis","Chaperonin","Co-chaperone","Heat_shock_protein","Pharmacoperone","Proteasome"]}
