{"cursor":"1720","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n â prosthetic group of haemoglobin]]\n\nA 'conjugated protein' is a protein that functions in interaction with other\nchemical groups attached by covalent bonds or by weak interactions.\n\nMany proteins contain only amino acids and no other chemical groups, and they\nare called simple proteins. However, other kind of proteins yield, on\nhydrolysis, some other chemical component in addition to amino acids and they\nare called conjugated proteins. The nonamino part of a conjugated protein is\nusually called its prosthetic group. Most prosthetic groups are formed from\nvitamins. Conjugated proteins are classified on the basis of the chemical nature\nof their prosthetic groups.\n\nSome examples of conjugated proteins are lipoproteins, glycoproteins,\nphosphoproteins, hemoproteins, flavoproteins, metalloproteins, phytochromes,\ncytochromes and opsins.\n\nHemoglobin contains the prosthetic group containing iron, which is the heme. It\nis within the heme group that carries the oxygen molecule through the binding of\nthe oxygen molecule to the iron ion (Fe2+) found in the heme group.\n\nGlycoproteins are generally the largest and most abundant group of conjugated\nproteins. They range from glycoproteins in cell surface membranes that\nconstitute the glycocalyx, to important antibodies produced by leukocytes.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Conjugated_protein","recorded":1362503102,"links":22,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Proteins"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Hemoglobin.gif/250px-Hemoglobin.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Heme_b.svg/220px-Heme_b.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Myoglobin.png/30px-Myoglobin.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Prosthetic_group","Protein","Covalent_bond","Amino_acid","Prosthetic_group","Prosthetic_groups","Lipoprotein","Glycoprotein","Phosphoprotein","Hemoprotein","Flavoprotein","Metalloprotein","Phytochrome","Cytochrome","Opsin","Hemoglobin","Prosthetic_group","Heme","Heme","Heme","Glycocalyx","Antibodies","Leukocytes"]}
