Fundamental\n to the way in which organisms cope with environmental variation, phenotypic\n plasticity encompasses all types of environmentally-induced changes (e.g.\n morphological, physiological, behavioural, phenological) that may or may not be\n permanent throughout an individualâs lifespan. The term was originally used to\n describe developmental effects on morphological characters, but is now more\n broadly used to describe all phenotypic responses to environmental change, such\n as acclimation.\n\nGenerally, phenotypic plasticity is more important for immobile organisms (e.g.\nplants) than mobile organisms (e.g. most animals), as mobile organisms can often\nmove away from unfavourable environments. http://arjournals.annualreviews.o-\nrg/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.es.17.110186.003315 Annual Review of Ecology and\nSystematics Vol. 17:667-693 (Volume publication date November 1986) \nNevertheless, some mobile organisms also have significant phenotypic plasticity;\nfor example Acyrthosiphon pisum of the Aphid family exhibits the ability to\ninterchange between asexual and sexual reproduction, as well as growing wings\nbetween generations when plants become too populated. http://www.plosbiolog-\ny.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000313 PLoS Biology, Jan 19\n2010, \"Genome Sequence of the Pea Aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum\".
