Barclays World of Cricket, 2nd edition, Collins Publishers, 1980,\nISBN 0-00-216349-7, p90. Nelson as a representative team played\ninterprovincial cricket as early as 1862, later first playing first-\nclass cricket in 1874 against Wellington at the Basin Reserve, in doing so\nbecoming the fifth team to play first-class cricket in New Zealand. This match\nis also notable for having ended in a tie, the eighth time this had happened\nand one of sixty occasions overall that a first-class match has ended in such\na result. Over the coming seasons, Nelson average one first-class\nmatch a year, before appearing in first-class cricket for a final time in 1891\nagainst Wellington at Trafalgar Park. Nelson appeared seventeen times in first-\nclass cricket, winning nine and losing seven. Nelson used three\nhome grounds during this period: Victory Square, the Botanical Gardens and\nTrafalgar Park.\n\nNelson today competes in the Hawke Cup, which is played below first-class level.\nThe Nelson Cricket Association has recently relocated from Trafalgar Park to the\nSaxton Oval. The Nelson Cricket Association forms part of the Central Districts\ncricket team, which competes in first-class, List A and Twenty20 domestic\ncricket competitions.\n","linknr":122,"url":"Nelson_cricket_team","recorded":1363134488,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/England","/wiki/Lancashire_League_(cricket)","/wiki/Nelson_Cricket_Club","/wiki/Cricket","/wiki/Nelson_Region","/wiki/New_Zealand","/wiki/Hawke_Cup","#cite_note-1","#cite_note-2","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Wellington_cricket_team","/wiki/Basin_Reserve","#cite_note-3","/wiki/Trafalgar_Park,_Nelson","#cite_note-4","/wiki/Victory_Square,_Nelson","/wiki/Botanical_Gardens,_Nelson","/wiki/Saxton_Oval","/wiki/Central_Districts_cricket_team","/wiki/List_A_cricket","/wiki/Twenty20","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","/wiki/Special:BookSources/0002163497","#cite_ref-2","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/228/Other_Matches.html","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/228/Other_Matches.html","#cite_ref-3","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1862.html","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1862.html","#cite_ref-4","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/228/First-Class_Matches.html","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/228/First-Class_Matches.html","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&action=edit&section=2","http://www.nelsoncricket.org.nz/","http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/228/228.html","/wiki/CricketArchive","/wiki/Template:New_Zealand_first-class_cricket_clubs","/wiki/Template_talk:New_Zealand_first-class_cricket_clubs","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:New_Zealand_first-class_cricket_clubs&action=edit","/wiki/First-class_cricket","/wiki/Auckland_cricket_team","/wiki/Canterbury_cricket_team","/wiki/Central_Districts_cricket_team","/wiki/Northern_Districts_cricket_team","/wiki/Otago_cricket_team","/wiki/Wellington_cricket_team","/w/index.php?title=Central_Conference_cricket_team&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Hawke%27s_Bay_cricket_team","/w/index.php?title=Northern_Conference_cricket_team&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Southern_Conference_cricket_team&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Southland_cricket_team","/wiki/Taranaki_cricket_team","/wiki/West_Coast_cricket_team","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&oldid=528218916","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Cricket_teams_in_New_Zealand","/wiki/Category:Sport_in_Nelson,_New_Zealand","/wiki/Category:Former_first-class_cricket_clubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nelson+cricket+team&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Nelson+cricket+team","/wiki/Nelson_cricket_team","/wiki/Talk:Nelson_cricket_team","#","/wiki/Nelson_cricket_team","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Nelson_cricket_team","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Nelson_cricket_team","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&oldid=528218916","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Nelson_cricket_team&id=528218916","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Nelson+cricket+team","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Nelson+cricket+team&oldid=528218916&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Nelson_cricket_team&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimedia
