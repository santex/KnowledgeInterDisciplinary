{"cursor":"23129","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Information technology' (also referred to as IT) is the application of\ncomputers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and\nmanipulate data, often in the context of a business or other\nenterprise. The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and\ncomputer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution\ntechnologies such as television and telephones. Several industries are\nassociated with information technology, such as computer hardware, software,\nelectronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, e-commerce and\ncomputer services.\n\nIn the business context, the Information Technology Association of America has\ndefined information technology (IT) as \"the study, design, development,\napplication, implementation, support or management of computer-based information\nsystems\". The business value of information technology is to automate business\nprocesses, provide information for decision making, connect business with their\ncustomers, and provide productivity tools to increase efficiency. In an academic\ncontext, the Association for Computing Machinery defines it as \"undergraduate\ndegree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of\nbusiness, government, healthcare, schools, and other kinds of\norganizations .... IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting\nhardware and software products appropriate for an organization, integrating\nthose products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and installing,\ncustomizing, and maintaining those applications for the organizationâs computer\nusers. Examples of these responsibilities include the installation of networks;\nnetwork administration and security; the design of web pages; the development of\nmultimedia resources; the installation of communication components; the\noversight of email systems; and the planning and management of the technology\nlifecycle by which an organizationâs technology is maintained, upgraded, and\nreplaced.\" The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula\n2005.

We shall call it information technology (IT).\" Based on the storage and processing technology employed,\nit is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-\nmechanical (3000 BC â 1450 AD), mechanical (1450â1840),\nelectromechanical (1840â1940) and electronic (1940-present).\nThis article focuses on the most recent period, (electronic) which began around\nthe year 1940.\n","linknr":914,"url":"Information_technology","recorded":1362503340,"links":103,"instances":["computer_security","electronic","journal","computer"],"pdf":["http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf","http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ims/idc-power-of-ims.pdf","http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ims/idc-power-of-ims.pdf","http://www.weforum.org/pdf/gitr/2009/gitr09fullreport.pdf"],"categories":["Information technology|","Media technology"],"headings":["History of computers","History of Information Technology","Data storage","Databases","Data retrieval","Data transmission","Data manipulation","Commercial perspective","Ethics","Indian IT Industry","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Messagebox_info.svg/16px-Messagebox_info.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/16px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["z3","computer"],["science","journal"],["spam","electronic"],["hacker","computer_security"]],"members":["hacker","spam","science","z3"],"related":["Computer_industry","Computer_hardware","Software","Electronics","Semiconductors","Internet","Telecommunications_equipment","E-commerce","Computer_services","Information_Technology_Association_of_America","Association_for_Computing_Machinery","Sumer","Mesopotamia","Cuneiform","Tally_stick","Antikythera_mechanism","Analog_computer","Z3_(computer)","Programming","Colossus_computer","Nazi_Germany","Electronics","Digital","Computer_programming","Stored-program_computer","Manchester_Small-Scale_Experimental_Machine","Colossus_computer","Punched_tape","World_War_II","Delay_line_memory","Radar","Random-access_memory","Williams_tube","Cathode_ray_tube","Drum_memory","Ferranti_Mark_1","Hard_disk_drive","CD-ROM","Exabyte","IBM","IBM_Information_Management_System","Hierarchical_database_model","Edgar_F._Codd","Set_theory","Predicate_logic","Relational_database_management_system","Oracle_Corporation","Database_schema","XML","File_system","Relational_database","Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language","SQL","Relational_algebra","Data_warehouse","Decision_support_system","Communications_protocol","SOAP","Document_Object_Model","Science_(journal)","Moore's_law","Data_mining","Peripheral","Data_center_services","Enterprise_Software","IT_Services","Telecommunication","Norbert_Wiener","Spam_(electronic)","Hacker_(computer_security)","HTTP_cookie","Spyware","Information_and_communications_technology","Information_systems","Computing","Oxford_University_Press"]}
