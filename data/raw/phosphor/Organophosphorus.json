{"cursor":"20092","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Organophosphorus compounds' are degradable organic compounds containing\ncarbonâphosphorus bonds (thus excluding phosphate and phosphite esters, which\nlack this kind of bonding), used primarily in pest control as an alternative to\nchlorinated hydrocarbons that persist in the environment. Organophosphorus\nchemistry is the corresponding science of the properties and reactivity of\norganophosphorus compounds. Phosphorus shares group 5 in the periodic table with\nnitrogen and phosphorus compounds and nitrogen compounds are somewhat\nrelated. Dillon, K. B.; Mathey, F.; Nixon, J. F. Phosphorus. The Carbon\nCopy; John Wiley & Sons, 1997. ISBN 0-471-97360-2 Quin, L. D. A Guide\nto Organophosphorus Chemistry; John Wiley & Sons, 2000. ISBN 0-471-31824-\n8 Racke, K.D., 1992. Degradation of organophosphorus insecticides in\nenvironmental matrices. In: Chambers, J.E., Levi, P.E. (Eds.), Organophosphates:\nChemistry, Fate, and Effects. Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 47â73.\n\nThe definition of organophosphorus compounds is variable, which can lead to\nconfusion. In industrial and environmental chemistry, an organophosphorus\ncompound need contain only an organic substituent, but need not have a direct\nP-C bond. Thus most pesticides, e.g., malathion, are often included in this\nclass of compounds.\n\nPhosphorus can adopt a variety of oxidation states, and it is general to\nclassify organophosphorus compounds based on their being derivatives of\nphosphorus(V) vs phosphorus(III), which are the predominant classes of\ncompounds. In a descriptive but only intermittently used nomenclature,\nphosphorus compounds are identified by their coordination number Î´ and their\nvalency Î». In this system, a phosphine is a Î´ 3Î» 3 compound.\n","linknr":479,"url":"Organophosphorus","recorded":1362372488,"links":36,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","letter"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/P04548.pdf"],"categories":["Organophosphorus|"],"headings":["Organophosphorus(V)
