Phosphorus is a scarce finite resource on earth and\ndue to its non-gaseous environmental cycle has resulted in alternative means of\nproduction other than mining being unavailable. According to some\nresearchers, Earth's phosphorus reserves are expected to be completely depleted\nin 50â100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately\n2030. Whereas in stark contrast the International\nFertilizer Development Center in a 2010 report estimates that global phosphate\nrock resources will last for several hundred years.
