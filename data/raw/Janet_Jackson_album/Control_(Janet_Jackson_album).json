Her collaborations with songwriters\nand record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional\nsound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap vocals, and synthesized\npercussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of\ncontemporary R&B. It enabled Jackson to transition into the popular music\nmarket, becoming one of the defining albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.\n\nContaining autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the\nresult of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to\nR&B singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and\nmanager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring A&M executive John\nMcClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis.\nThe album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal\ntestament of self-actualization.\n\nControl is widely regarded as the breakthrough album of Jackson's career. It\nbecame her first album to top the ''Billboard'' 200 and five of its commercial\nsinglesâ\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\", \"Nasty\", \"Control\", \"When I Think of\nYou\", and \"Let's Wait Awhile\"âpeaked within the top five of the ''Billboard''\nHot 100. Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing\nability and became a catalyst for MTV's evolving demographics. The album went on\nto receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for\nAlbum of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and\nLewis in 1987. It is listed by the National Association of Recording\nMerchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive\nAlbums of All Time. It has been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording\nIndustry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold over fourteen million copies\nworldwide.\n","linknr":945,"url":"Control_(Janet_Jackson_album)","recorded":1362477640,"links":49,"instances":["music","song","entertainer","song","manager","producer","musician","madonna_album","band","song","janet_jackson_song"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1986
