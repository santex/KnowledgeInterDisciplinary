Depending on the group's philosophy, its operational area, the\ncommunications technologies available, and the nature of the mission, it can\nrange from a strict hierarchy to an extremely distributed organization. It is\nalso a method used by criminal organizations, undercover operatives, and\nunconventional warfare (UW) led by special forces. Historically, clandestine\norganizations have avoided electronic communications, because signals\nintelligence is a strength of conventional militaries and counterintelligence\norganizations.\n\nIn the context of tradecraft, covert and clandestine are not synonymous. The\nadversary is aware that a covert activity is happening, but does not know who is\ndoing it, and certainly not their sponsorship. Clandestine activities, however,\nif successful, are completely unknown to the adversary, and their function, such\nas espionage, would be neutralized if there was any awareness of the activity. A\n'covert' cell structure is tantamount to a contradiction in terms, because the\npoint of the cell structure is that its details are completely hidden from the\nopposition.\n\nA 'sleeper cell' refers to a cell, or isolated grouping of sleeper agents that\nlies dormant until it receives orders or decides to act.\n","linknr":432,"url":"Clandestine_cell_system","recorded":1362371297,"links":36,"instances":["terrorism"],"pdf":["http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=386&filename=387.pdf","http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=386&filename=387.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/aqmanual.pdf","http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/aqmanual.pdf","http://www.metatempo.com/huntingthesleepers.pdf","http://www.metatempo.com/huntingthesleepers.pdf","http://www.psych.lse.ac.uk/complexity/Conference/FellmanWright.pdf","http://www.psych.lse.ac.uk/complexity/Conference/FellmanWright.pdf"],"categories":["Counter-intelligence","Types of espionage","Intelligence analysis","Military intelligence","Military tactics","Secrecy","Terrorism tactics"],"headings":["History","Parallel organizations","External support","Models of insurgency and associated cell characteristics","Classic models for cell system operations","Non-traditional models, exemplified by al-Qaeda","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg/45px-Unbalanced_scales.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9b/Vcnvastructure4rev.jpg/220px-Vcnvastructure4rev.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Wdip-Cell-0.png/220px-Wdip-Cell-0.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Wnoc-Cell-0.png/220px-Wnoc-Cell-0.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Wnoc-Cell-1.png/220px-Wnoc-Cell-1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/T-Cell-0.png/220px-T-Cell-0.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/T-Cell-1.png/220px-T-Cell-1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/T-Cell-2.png/220px-T-Cell-2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lone_wolf","terrorism"]],"members":["lone_wolf"],"related":["Philosophy","Organized_crime","Undercover","Special_forces","Signals_intelligence","Tradecraft","Covert_operation","Clandestine_operation","Sleeper_agent","French_Resistance","Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army","Operation_Jedburgh","United_States_Army_Center_of_Military_History","Viet_Cong","Viet_Cong_and_PAVN_strategy_and_tactics","Self-criticism","Vietnam_War","Sinn_Féin","Hamas","Hezbollah","CIA","United_States_Army_Special_Forces","Unconventional_warfare","Foreign_internal_defense","Operation_White_Star","Eighth_Route_Army","United_States_Marine_Corps","Al-Qaeda","Sinn_Féin","Viet_Cong","Nazi","Continuity_of_government","Coup_d'etat","Sandinista","Cuba","Peoples'_Republic_of_China","American_Revolution","Shining_Path","Espionage","Sabotage","Unconventional_warfare","CIA_cryptonym","Dead_drop","SIGINT","COMINT","FATA","Pakistan","United_States_Army_Combined_Arms_Center","Leaderless_resistance","Lone_wolf_(terrorism)"]}
