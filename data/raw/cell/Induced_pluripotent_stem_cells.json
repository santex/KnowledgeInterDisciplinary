{"cursor":"53001","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Induced pluripotent stem cells', commonly abbreviated as 'iPS\ncells' or 'iPSCs' are a type of pluripotent stem cell artificially derived from\na non-pluripotent cell - typically an adult somatic cell - by inducing a\n\"forced\" expression of specific genes.\n\nInduced pluripotent stem cells are similar to natural pluripotent stem cells,\nsuch as embryonic stem (ES) cells, in many aspects, such as the expression of\ncertain stem cell genes and proteins, chromatin methylation patterns, doubling\ntime, embryoid body formation, teratoma formation, viable chimera formation, and\npotency and differentiability, but the full extent of their relation to natural\npluripotent stem cells is still being assessed.\nInduced pluripotent cells have been made from adult stomach, liver, skin cells\nand blood cells.\n\niPSCs were first produced in 2006 from mouse cells and in 2007 from human cells\nin a series of experiments by Shinya Yamanaka's team at Kyoto University, Japan,\nand by James Thomson's team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. For her iPSC\nresearch, Dr. Nancy Bachman, of Oneonta, NY, was awarded the Wolf Prize in\nMedicine in 2012 (along with John B. Gurdon). {{cite web | url =\nhttp://www.wolffund.org.il/full.asp?id=171 | title = THE 2011 WOLF FOUNDATION\nPRIZE IN MEDICINE\n| publisher =Wolf foundation| accessdate = 2012-01-01}} For his\n| iPSC discovery (and for deriving the first human embryonic stem cell), James\n| Thomson received the 2011 [http://www.amc.edu/Academic/AlbanyPrize/ Albany\n| Medical Center Prize for Biomedical Research] and the\n| [http://www.kff.com/EN01/KFIP/KFIPIndex.html 2011 King Faisal International\n| Prize], which he shared with Yamanaka. In October 2012, Yamanaka and fellow\n| stem cell researcher John Gurdon were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or\n| Medicine \"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become\n| pluripotent.\"\n\niPSCs are an important advance in stem cell research, as they may allow\nresearchers to obtain pluripotent stem cells, which are important in research\nand potentially have therapeutic uses, without the controversial use of embryos.\nBecause iPSCs are developed from a patient's own somatic cells, it was believed\nthat treatment of iPSCs would avoid any immunogenic responses; however, Zhao et\nal. have challenged this assumption.\n\nDepending on the methods used, reprogramming of adult cells to obtain iPSCs may\npose significant risks that could limit their use in humans. For example, if\nviruses are used to genomically alter the cells, the expression of cancer-\ncausing genes \"oncogenes\" may potentially be triggered. In February 2008,\nscientists announced the discovery of a technique that could remove oncogenes\nafter the induction of pluripotency, thereby increasing the potential use of iPS\ncells in human diseases. In April 2009, it was demonstrated\nthat generation of iPS cells is possible without any genetic alteration of the\nadult cell: a repeated treatment of the cells with certain proteins channeled\ninto the cells via poly-arginine anchors was sufficient to induce\npluripotency. The acronym given for those iPSCs is 'piPSCs' (protein-\ninduced pluripotent stem cells).\n","linknr":627,"url":"Induced_pluripotent_stem_cells","recorded":1362485045,"links":33,"instances":["journal","cell_biologist","journal","genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stem cells"],"headings":["Production of iPSCs","Identity","Safety for regenerative medicine","An open future","Use in drug development","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Dedifferentiation_Methods_%282010%29_-_Bischoff%2C_Steven_R.tif/lossy-page1-220px-Dedifferentiation_Methods_%282010%29_-_Bischoff%2C_Steven_R.tif.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Induction_of_iPS_cells.svg/350px-Induction_of_iPS_cells.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Production_of_iPSC_Timeline.png/220px-Production_of_iPSC_Timeline.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Lifecycle_of_the_Piggybac_Transposon_System.png/220px-Lifecycle_of_the_Piggybac_Transposon_System.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chimera","genetics"],["chimera","genetics"],["chimera","genetics"],["science","journal"],["james_thomson","cell_biologist"],["cell","journal"],["chimera","genetics"]],"members":["science","james_thomson","cell","chimera"],"related":["Pluripotent","Stem_cell","Pluripotent","Somatic_cell","Gene","Embryonic_stem_cell","DNA_methylation","Embryoid_body","Teratoma","Chimera_(genetics)","Shinya_Yamanaka","Kyoto_University","Wolf_Prize_in_Medicine","John_Gurdon","John_Gurdon","Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine","Stem_cell_controversy","Oncogenes","Cell_penetrating_peptide","Transfection","Fibroblast","Retrovirus","Oct-3/4","Sox2","Reporter_gene","Shinya_Yamanaka","Kyoto_University","Retrovirus","Myc","Klf4","Fbx15","Chimera_(genetics)","Harvard","MIT","University_of_California,_Los_Angeles","Nanog","Oncogenic","University_of_Texas_MD_Anderson_Cancer_Center","Nuclear_DNA","Fibroblast","Y-chromosome","Turner_Syndrome","Blastocyst","Chimera_(genetics)","Science_(journal)","James_Thomson_(cell_biologist)","University_of_Wisconsinâ€“Madison","Cell_(journal)","Retrovirus","Lentivirus","Nature_Protocols","Transcription_factors","Oct3/4","Sox2","C-Myc","Somatic","Somatic","Somatic","Transcription_factors","Transcription_factor","Plasmids","Adenovirus","Transposon","Oncogenes","Fibroblast","Tetraploid","Blastocysts","Transcription_factor","Transcription_factor","Sox2","Calcium_channels","Somatic","Adenovirus","Plasmids","Adenovirus","Transcription_factors","Adenovirus","Adenoviruses","Oct4","Sox2","Plasmids","Transposon","Transposon","Transcription_factor","MET","MicroRNA","MicroRNA","MicroRNA","MicroRNA","Oct-3/4","SOX_genes","Kruppel-like_factors","Myc","Nanog","LIN28","Octamer_transcription_factor","Blastomere","Embryonic_stem_cell","Trophoblast","Oct1","Oct6","Sox2","Sox1","Sox3","Sox15","Sox18","Klf4","Klf2","Klf1","Klf5","Protooncogene","Johns_Hopkins_University","Teratoma","N-myc","L-myc","RNA-binding_protein","Embryonic_stem_cell","Embryonic_stem_cell","Nucleolus","Cytoplasm","Mitosis","Telomerase","Hayflick_limit","Telomerase_reverse_transcriptase","Neuron","Catecholamine","Dopaminergic","Cardiac_muscle","Immunodeficiency","Teratoma","Germ_layers","Endoderm","Mesoderm","Ectoderm","Embryoid_body","Embryoblast","Blastocyst","Trophoblast","Micropipette","Chimera_(genetics)","Tetraploid_complementation_assay","Gene_expression","Cytosin","DNA_methylation","Histone","Teratoma","Stanford_University","TP63","University_of_Oxford","Induced_stem_cells","Stem_cell_treatments"]}
