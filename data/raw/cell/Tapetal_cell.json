{"cursor":"1165","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nTapetum}} The 'tapetum' is a layer of nutritive cells found within the\nsporangium, particularly within the anther, of flowering plants.\n\nTapetum is important for the development of pollen grains. The cells are usually\nbigger and normally have more than one nucleus per cell. As the sporogenous\ncells undergo mitosis, the nuclei of tapetal cells also divide. Sometimes, this\nmitosis is not normal due to which many cells of mature tapetum become\nmultinucleate. Sometimes polyploidy and polyteny can also be seen. The unusually\nlarge nuclear constitution of the tapetum helps it in providing nutrients and\nregulatory molecules to the forming pollen grains. The following processes are\nresponsible for this:\n* Endomitosis\n* Normal mitosis not followed by cytokinesis\n* Formation of restitution nuclei\n* Endoreduplication\n\nTapetum helps in pollenwall formation, transportation of nutrients to inner side\nof anther, synthesis of callase enzyme for separation of microspore tetrads.\n","linknr":91,"url":"Tapetal_cell","recorded":1362512788,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant anatomy"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Fern.jpg/35px-Fern.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sporangium","Anther","Flowering_plant"]}
