{"cursor":"2861","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, Afghanistan.]]\n\nA 'prison cell', 'holding cell' or 'lock-up' is a small room in a prison, or\npolice station where a prisoner is held.\n\nPrison cells are usually about 6 by 8 feet in size with steel or brick walls and\none solid or barred door that locks from the outside. Many modern prison cells\nare pre-cast. Solid doors may have a window that allows the prisoner to be\nobserved from the outside. Furnishings and fixtures inside the cell are\nconstructed so that they cannot be easily broken and are anchored to the walls\nor floor. Stainless steel lavatories and commodes are also used. This prevents\nvandalism or the making of weapons.\n\nThere are a number of prison and prison cell configurations, from simple police\nstation holding cells, to massive cell blocks in larger correctional facilities.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, cells in a police station are the responsibility of the\nCustody Sergeant, who also logs each detainee and allocates him or her an\navailable cell. Custody Sergeants also ensure cells are clean and as germ-free\nas possible, in accordance with the Human Rights Act.\n\nThe practice of assigning only one inmate to each cell in a prison is called\nsingle-celling.\n\nSome United States prisons offer upgrades. Costing around 100 dollars a night,\nthese cells are considered cleaner and quieter, some of which offer extra\nfacilities. \n","linknr":223,"url":"Prison_cell","recorded":1362371296,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Penology","Penal imprisonment","Law enforcement","Rooms"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Bagram_prison_cell.jpg/220px-Bagram_prison_cell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Scale_of_justice_2.svg/16px-Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Prisonbars.PNG/30px-Prisonbars.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Afghanistan","Prison","Police_station","Prisoner","Pre-Cast_Prison_Cell","United_Kingdom","Police_station","Custody_Sergeant","Human_Rights_Act","Single-celling"]}
