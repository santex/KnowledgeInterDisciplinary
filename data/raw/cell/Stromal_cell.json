{"cursor":"1818","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In cell biology, 'stromal cells' are connective tissue cells of any organ, for\nexample in the uterine mucosa (endometrium), prostate, bone marrow, and the\novary. They are cells that support the function of the parenchymal cells of that\norgan. Fibroblasts, immune cells, pericytes, and inflammatory cells are the most\ncommon types of stromal cells.\n\nThe interaction between stromal cells and tumor cells is known to play a major\nrole in cancer growth and progression.\n\nStromal cells (in the dermis layer) adjacent to the epidermis (the very top\nlayer of the skin) release growth factors that promote cell division. This keeps\nthe epidermis regenerating from the bottom while the top layer of cells on the\nepidermis are constantly being \"sloughed\" off of the body. Certain types of skin\ncancers (basal cell carcinomas) cannot spread throughout the body because the\ncancer cells require nearby stromal cells to continue their division. The loss\nof these stromal growth factors when the cancer moves throughout the body\nprevents the cancer from invading other organs.\n","linknr":259,"url":"Stromal_cell","recorded":1362893168,"links":19,"instances":["disambiguation","biology","skin"],"pdf":["http://anatomy.ucsf.edu/Werbwebsite/publication%20list%202002/1046.pdf","http://anatomy.ucsf.edu/Werbwebsite/publication%20list%202002/1046.pdf"],"categories":["Connective tissue cells"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/NIEHScell.jpg/50px-NIEHScell.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["organ","biology"],["epidermis","skin"],["stroma","disambiguation"]],"members":["stroma","organ","epidermis"],"related":["Cell_biology","Connective_tissue","Organ_(biology)","Uterus","Mucosa","Endometrium","Prostate","Bone_marrow","Ovary","Parenchymal_cells","Fibroblasts","Immune_cells","Pericytes","Tumor_cells","Cancer","Epidermis_(skin)","Growth_factors","Cell_division","Basal_cell_carcinoma","Cancer","Stroma_(disambiguation)","Stroma_of_ovary"]}
