He\ngives direction to important political and societal debates and has some\nimportant \"reserve powers\" in case of political instability (such as those\nprovided for by Article 81 of the Basic Law).\n\nFurthermore all federal laws must be signed by the President before they can\ncome into effect. Theoretically the President thereby has a power of veto, but\nno President since World War II has ever openly used this theoretically given\nveto power. Within the frame of Germany's constitutional reality the presidents\nhave only refused to sign laws that they believed to violate the constitution,\nor at least they justified their refusal to sign a law with concerns regarding\nthe constitutionality of the concerned law.\n\nThe President is elected by the Federal Convention, a body established solely\nfor that purpose. The first official residence of the president is the Bellevue\nPalace in Berlin. The President's second official residence is the Hammerschmidt\nVilla in Bonn.\n\nThe office of President of Germany was first created in 1919, replacing the\nemperor as head of state, with Friedrich Ebert (SPD) serving as the first\npresident. The presidential standard, adopted in 1921, is still used today.\nWhile Germany had a semi-presidential system during the Weimar Republic, today's\npresidential office is mainly supervising and ceremonial, with the Chancellor of\nGermany generally seen as wielding the effective power and guideline authority\nin everyday politics.\n\nThe current officeholder is Joachim Gauck who was elected on 18 March 2012.\n","linknr":726,"url":"President_of_Germany","recorded":1362557399,"links":71,"instances":["germany","voting","federal_republic","germany","political_custom","germany","weimar_republic","protectorate"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Government of Germany","Lists of political office-holders in Germany","Lists of presidents|Germany, President of","Presidents of Germany| List"],"headings":["Selection","Qualifications","Duties and functions","Impartiality and influence","Reserve powers","Succession","Impeachment and removal","Presidential standard","History","List of presidents","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Standarte_des_Bundespr%C3%A4sidenten.svg/120px-Standarte_des_Bundespr%C3%A4sidenten.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Joachim_gauck_dts_nachrichtenagentur.jpg/220px-Joachim_gauck_dts_nachrichtenagentur.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Coat_of_Arms_of_Germany.svg/110px-Coat_of_Arms_of_Germany.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/16px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg/20px-Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Standarte_des_Bundespr%C3%A4sidenten.svg/170px-Standarte_des_Bundespr%C3%A4sidenten.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/22px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["bellevue_palace","germany"],["federal_convention","germany"],["federal_convention","germany"],["plurality","voting"],["bundesrat","germany"],["chancellor_of_germany","federal_republic"],["chancellor_of_germany","federal_republic"],["reichstag","weimar_republic"],["saar","protectorate"],["federal_convention","germany"],["constitutional_convention","political_custom"]],"members":["bundesrat","plurality","chancellor_of_germany","federal_convention","constitutional_convention","bellevue_palace","reichstag","saar"],"related":["Bellevue_Palace_(Germany)","Villa_Hammerschmidt","Joachim_Gauck","Friedrich_Ebert","Theodor_Heuss","Head_of_state","Germany","Germany","Parliamentary_system","Chancellor_of_Germany","Reserve_power","Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany","Federal_Convention_(Germany)","Schloss_Bellevue","Berlin","Hammerschmidt_Villa","Bonn","Emperor_of_Germany","Friedrich_Ebert","SPD","Flags_of_Germany","Semi-presidential_system","Weimar_Republic","Chancellor_of_Germany","Joachim_Gauck","German_presidential_election,_2012","Federal_Convention_(Germany)","Bundestag","States_of_Germany","Legislature","Proportional_representation","Basic_Law_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany","President_of_the_German_Bundesrat","Horst_Köhler","Christian_Wulff","Plurality_(voting)","Bundesrat_(Germany)","Chancellor_of_Germany_(Federal_Republic)","Cabinet_of_Germany","Constructive_Vote_of_No_Confidence","Gerhard_Schröder","Veto","Constitutional_monarch","Chancellor_of_Germany_(Federal_Republic)","Moral_authority","Horst_Köhler","Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany","Immigration_law","Brandenburg","Vice_president","President_of_the_German_Bundesrat","Jens_Böhrnsen","Bremen","Bundesrat_of_Germany","Theodor_Heuss","Friedrich_Ebert","Weimar_Constitution","World_War_I","Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor","Friedrich_Ebert","Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany","Paul_von_Hindenburg","Chancellor_of_Germany","Adolf_Hitler","Führer_und_Reichskanzler","NSDAP","Second_World_War","Karl_Dönitz","Weimar_Constitution","Semi-presidential_system","Reichstag_(Weimar_Republic)","Vote_of_no_confidence","Referendum","Two-round_system","Paul_von_Hindenburg","West_Germany","Saar_(protectorate)","East_Germany","Wilhelm_Pieck","State_Council_of_the_German_Democratic_Republic","Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany","Grundgesetz","West_Germany","Reunification_of_Germany","Federal_Convention_(Germany)","Parliamentary_system","Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)"]}
