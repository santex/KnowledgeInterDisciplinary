It is currently part of\nthe GNU coreutils package and the BSD Base System. It first appeared in AT&T\nSystem III UNIX in 1982. http://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/1/CUT/\n\nExtraction of line segments can typically be done by bytes ( -b ),\ncharacters ( -c ), or fields ( -f ) separated by a\ndelimiter ( -d — the tab character by default). A range must\nbe provided in each case which consists of one of N , N-\nM, N- ( N to the end of the line), or -\nM (beginning of the line to M ), where N and M are counted\nfrom 1 (there is no zeroth value). Since version 6, an error is thrown if you\ninclude a zeroth value. Prior to this the value was ignored and assumed to be 1.\n","linknr":260,"url":"Cut_(Unix)","recorded":1362674371,"links":27,"instances":["punctuation","computing","unix"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Unix text processing utilities","Standard Unix programs","Unix SUS2008 utilities"],"headings":["Examples","Syntax","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["character","computing"],["colon","punctuation"],["colon","punctuation"],["paste","unix"]],"members":["colon","character","paste"],"related":["Computing","Unix","Command_line","Computer_file","GNU_Core_Utilities","UNIX_System_III","Byte","Character_(computing)","Tab_character","Zeroth","Colon_(punctuation)","Colon_(punctuation)","Byte","Multi-byte","Delimiter","Multi-byte_character","Unix_shell","Standard_input","List_of_Unix_programs","Grep","Paste_(Unix)","Awk"]}
