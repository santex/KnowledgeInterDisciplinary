{"cursor":"55259","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'quartz crystal microbalance' (QCM) measures a mass per unit area by measuring\nthe change in frequency of a quartz crystal resonator. The resonance is\ndisturbed by the addition or removal of a small mass due to oxide growth/decay\nor film deposition at the surface of the acoustic resonator. The QCM can be used\nunder vacuum, in gas phase (\"gas sensor\", first use described by King ) and more recently in liquid environments. It is useful for\nmonitoring the rate of deposition in thin film deposition systems under vacuum.\nIn liquid, it is highly effective at determining the affinity of molecules\n(proteins, in particular) to surfaces functionalized with recognition sites.\nLarger entities such as viruses or polymers are investigated, as well. QCM has\nalso been used to investigate interactions between biomolecules. Frequency\nmeasurements are easily made to high precision (discussed below); hence, it is\neasy to measure mass densities down to a level of below 1 Î¼g/cm 2. In\naddition to measuring the frequency, the dissipation is often measured to help\nanalysis. The dissipation is a parameter quantifying the damping in the system,\nand is related to the sample's viscoelastic properties. The dissipation is equal\nto the ratio of bandwidth, w, (see below) and frequency, f.\n","linknr":532,"url":"Quartz_crystal_microbalance","recorded":1362509980,"links":19,"instances":["physics","physics","mechanics","trigonometric_function","biology","signal_processing","device","materials_science","matter","electrical"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Weighing instruments"],"headings":["General","Gravimetric and non-gravimetric QCM","Surface acoustic wave-based sensors","Instrumental","Quantification of dissipative processes","Equivalent circuits","Small-load approximation","Viscoelastic modeling","Point contacts","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Quartz_resonators_with_front_and_back_electrodes.jpg/400px-Quartz_resonators_with_front_and_back_electrodes.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/QCM_principle.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/QCM_ringdown.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/2/d222aa334e4a431806006791e93f3dea.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/QCM_BvD_equivalent_circuit.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/7/7/67738633cb249f61f52a340b33c0bc68.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/6/5/c6538ff9cd9e5dccf304256a2d62840d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/4/e/24ee407d484041769d9d4b0861ddd0e6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/8/0/2809e63a04fae5f6ef572001c7e76674.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/d/e0d081eb6a52e1e6a967a580d09d8fe6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/4/5/f456e2a53b5d56979d742cb267c48e37.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/d/6/bd67dfed115319c8b89581389574f03c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/b/0eb203ac05cda0e8b6707ac54e8c0d35.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/7/2d7a820c8fa46e3e02e17feeabdefeac.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/a/64a098cbf8c2afc0c715d6993fece717.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/0/4/40405eabdbdebbecf7e6a6362e88feed.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/b/2/cb21f05ae73213b514f04854a586240e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/7/3/e7371d2485ac97647a031e4e84945156.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/9/a/79af93821cd5a0b0131c4ff956c0f027.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/3/2/a3222290cc91c6bcce35ad6834c5b673.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/9/f/c9fd53ae53e16dc1b80225372b28b3cd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/0/1/f01bc1c797aa23e79e5b8e80d164ce72.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["bandwidth","signal_processing"],["torsion","mechanics"],["node","physics"],["network_analyzer","electrical"],["stress","physics"],["strain","materials_science"],["spring","device"],["vesicle","biology"],["tangent","trigonometric_function"]],"members":["stress","node","torsion","tangent","vesicle","bandwidth","spring","strain","phase","network_analyzer"],"related":["Frequency","Quartz_crystal","Resonance","Phase_(matter)","Thin-film_deposition","Chemical_affinity","Protein","Virus","Polymer","Dissipation","Damping","Viscoelasticity","Quartz","Crystals","Piezoelectricity","Voltage","Shear_wave","Q_factor","Bandwidth_(signal_processing)","Resonant_frequency","Sauerbrey_equation","Ellipsometry","Surface_Plasmon_Resonance","Spectroscopy","Dual_Polarisation_Interferometry","Thin-film_thickness_monitor","Monolayer","Viscosity","Force","Lanthanum_gallium_silicate","Surface_acoustic_wave","Love_wave","Torsion_(mechanics)","Mechanical_impedance","Node_(physics)","Laboratory","Seed_crystal","Dielectric","Resistor","Short_circuit","Longitudinal_wave","Electrical_conductance","Network_analyzer_(electrical)","Sine_wave","Overtone","Harmonic","Amplitude","Stress_(physics)","Strain_(materials_science)","Cubic_function","Inflection_point","Electrochemistry","Ohm's_law","Complex_number","Imaginary_part","Calibration","Electrical_circuits","Algebra","Continuum_mechanics","Analogy","Topology","Mechanical_impedance","Acoustic_impedance","Density","Inductance","Capacitance","Dashpot","Drag_coefficient","Spring_(device)","Hooke's_law","Transformer","Fundamental_frequency","Cell_culture","Vesicle_(biology)","Implicit_function","Perturbation_theory","Nonlinear_system","Wave_vector","Real_part","Imaginary_part","Shear_modulus","Newtonian_fluid","Inertia","Tangent_(trigonometric_function)","Taylor_series","Solvent","Polarizability","Sauerbrey_equation","Weighing_scale","Piezoelectricity","Thin-film_thickness_monitor","QCM-D"]}
