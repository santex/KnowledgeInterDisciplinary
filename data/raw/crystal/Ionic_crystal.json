Examples of such crystals are the alkali halides,\nincluding potassium fluoride, potassium chloride, potassium bromide, potassium\niodide, sodium fluoride, and other combinations of sodium, caesium, rubidium, or\nlithium ions with fluoride, bromide, chloride or iodide ions.  NaCl\nhas a 6:6 co-ordination. The properties of NaCl reflect the strong interactions\nthat exist between the ions. It is a good conductor of electricity when molten,\nbut very poor in the solid state. When fused the mobile ions carry charge\nthrough the liquid. They are characterized by strong absorption of\ninfrared radiation and have planes along which they cleave easily. The exact\narrangement of ions in an ionic lattice varies according to the size of the ions\nin the solid. \n","linknr":129,"url":"Ionic_crystal","recorded":1362477002,"links":31,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.twentyfirstcenturyscience.org/cd/additional-science/c5/teacher/resources/pdf/SSC5_0.pdf","http://www.twentyfirstcenturyscience.org/cd/additional-science/c5/teacher/resources/pdf/SSC5_0.pdf","http://www.twentyfirstcenturyscience.org/cd/additional-science/c5/teacher/resources/pdf/SSC5_0.pdf","http://www.twentyfirstcenturyscience.org/cd/additional-science/c5/teacher/resources/pdf/SSC5_0.pdf"],"categories":["Crystals"],"headings":["References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Sodium_chloride_crystal.png/220px-Sodium_chloride_crystal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Crystal","Ion","Electrostatic","Potassium_fluoride","Potassium_chloride","Potassium_bromide","Potassium_iodide","Sodium_fluoride","Sodium","Caesium","Rubidium","Lithium","Fluorine","Bromine","Chlorine","Iodine","Infrared_radiation"]}
