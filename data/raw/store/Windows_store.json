The platform can be used to provide listings\nfor desktop applications certified to run on Windows 8, but is also the primary\ndistribution platform for a new type of app called \"Windows Store apps\".\n\nFree and paid applications can be distributed through the Windows Store, with\npaid apps ranging in cost from US$1.49 to $999.99. The Windows Store was first\nmade available with Windows 8 Consumer Preview on February 29, 2012.\n\nComparable to other similar platforms, such as the Mac App Store and Google\nPlay, Windows Store is curated and apps must be certified for compatibility and\ncontent. Microsoft takes 30% of the sale price of Windows Store apps until sales\nreach $25,000 at which point it is reduced to 20%.\n\nIt was announced in December 2012 that the Windows store on Windows 8 and\nWindows RT editions has already reached 35,000 apps available.\n","linknr":621,"url":"Windows_store","recorded":1362575670,"links":26,"instances":["design_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Windows components","Software distribution platforms"],"headings":["History","Details","Guidelines","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/Windows_Store_icon.png/100px-Windows_Store_icon.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Windows_Store.png/300px-Windows_Store.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["metro","design_language"]],"members":["metro"],"related":["Microsft","Digital_distribution","Windows_8","Windows_RT","Microsoft_Windows","Windows_Marketplace","Digital_distribution","Microsoft","Windows_8","Windows_RT","Mobile_app","Mac_App_Store","Google_Play","Windows_Marketplace","Product_key","Metro_(design_language)","Windows8","Malware","Windows_Phone_Store","PEGI","ESRB","Xbox_Music","Xbox_Video","Windows_Phone_Store","List_of_Microsoft_software_applications"]}
