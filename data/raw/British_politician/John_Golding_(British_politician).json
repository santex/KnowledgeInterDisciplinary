{"cursor":"4042","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'John Golding' (9 March 1931â20 January 1999, age 67) was a Labour Party\npolitician and Trade Union leader in the United Kingdom.\n\nHe was educated at Chester Grammar School, Keele University and the London\nSchool of Economics. After some time working in the Civil Service he took up a\nresearch job with the Post Office Engineering Union.\n\nGolding was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at a by-\nelection in 1969. He served in the governments of Harold Wilson and Jim\nCallaghan, as PPS to Eric Varley as Minister of Technology, a Labour whip in\nopposition, and Minister for Employment. He was an outspoken opponent of Labour\nleft-wingers such as Tony Benn and Eric Heffer, whom he regarded as idle\ndreamers out of touch with the working-class.\n\nGolding was a key figure in the fight against the Militant tendency, and\nespecially in mobilising moderate trades union leaders to exercise their block\nvotes to this end. After his death writings of his about this were published\nunder the title Hammer of the Left: My Part in Defeating the Labour Left by John\nGolding and Paul Farrelly (see below).\n\nIn 1986 he left Parliament (by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds) to take up\nthe post of General Secretary of the National Communications Union. He held\nthis post until 1988. He had served as a member of the council of the Trades\nUnion Congress.\n\nAfter he vacated the Newcastle-under-Lyme seat, the resulting by-election was\nwon by his wife Llin, who held the seat until 2001; her successor in the seat\nwas Paul Farrelly.\n\nJohn Golding's most unusual claim to fame is that he once made a speech in\ncommittee lasting eleven hours and fifteen minutes. It nominally concerned a\nsmall amendment to the bill to privatise British Telecom. This filibuster was\ninstrumental in delaying the privatisation until after the 1983 general\nelection, but with Margaret Thatcher obtaining a massive parliamentary majority\nthe privatisation was soon forced through. Changes in British parliamentary\nprocedure mean that Golding's record is unlikely ever to be beaten.\n","linknr":146,"url":"John_Golding_(British_politician)","recorded":1364041506,"links":["/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Trade_Union","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Chester_Grammar_School","/wiki/Keele_University","/wiki/London_School_of_Economics","/wiki/Civil_Service","/wiki/Post_Office_Engineering_Union","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Newcastle-under-Lyme_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Harold_Wilson","/wiki/Jim_Callaghan","/wiki/Eric_Varley","/wiki/Minister_of_Technology","/w/index.php?title=Minister_for_Employment&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Tony_Benn","/wiki/Eric_Heffer","/wiki/Militant_tendency","/wiki/Paul_Farrelly","/wiki/Chiltern_Hundreds","/wiki/National_Communications_Union","/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress","/wiki/By-election","/wiki/Llin_Golding","/wiki/Privatization","/wiki/British_Telecom","/wiki/Filibuster_(legislative_tactic)","/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1983","/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher","/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&action=edit&section=1","http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/people/mr-john-golding","http://pawilton.net/keelealumni/KeeleLife/John_Golding.htm","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Stephen_Swingler","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Newcastle-under-Lyme_(UK_Parliament_constituency)","/wiki/Newcastle-under-Lyme_by-election,_1969","/wiki/Newcastle-under-Lyme_by-election,_1986","/wiki/Llin_Golding","/wiki/Bryan_Stanley","/wiki/National_Communications_Union","/wiki/Anthony_Young,_Baron_Young_of_Norwood_Green","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/100184971","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/File:Bigben_small.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b5/Bigben_small.png/25px-Bigben_small.png","/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)","/wiki/Member_of_Parliament","/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Labour-UK-MP-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Labour-UK-MP-stub&action=edit","/wiki/File:Flag_of_England.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/30px-Flag_of_England.svg.png","/wiki/File:Crystal_personal.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/24/Crystal_personal.svg/30px-Crystal_personal.svg.png","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:England-politician-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:England-politician-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:England-politician-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&oldid=520600455","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1931_births","/wiki/Category:1999_deaths","/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament_for_English_constituencies","/wiki/Category:Labour_Party_(UK)_MPs","/wiki/Category:Leaders_of_British_trade_unions","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Keele_University","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_the_London_School_of_Economics","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1966%E2%80%931970","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1970%E2%80%931974","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1974","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1974%E2%80%931979","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1979%E2%80%931983","/wiki/Category:UK_MPs_1983%E2%80%931987","/wiki/Category:Politics_of_Newcastle-under-Lyme","/wiki/Category:Labour_MP_(UK)_stubs","/wiki/Category:English_politician_stubs","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Golding+%28British+politician%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=John+Golding+%28British+politician%29","/wiki/John_Golding_(British_politician)","/wiki/Talk:John_Golding_(British_politician)","#","/wiki/John_Golding_(British_politician)","/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=John_Golding_(British_politician)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org
