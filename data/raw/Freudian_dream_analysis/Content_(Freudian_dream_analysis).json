Throughout the early part of the twentieth century,\npsychologist Sigmund Freud made incredible advances in the study and analysis of\ndreams. Freudâs (1900) The Interpretation of Dreams used an evolutionary\nbiological perspective to infer that these nightly visions are a product of\noneâs individual psyche. As the âroyal road to the unconsciousâ, dreams allow\nfor accessibility to parts of the mind that are inaccessible through conscious\nthought. According to his psychoanalytic theory, dreamsâlike most psychological\nexperiencesâcan be understood through two distinct levels: manifest and latent.\nModern research continuously proves that dreams contain fundamentally meaningful\ninformation. Therefore, appropriate interpretations of these two layers can\nfacilitate assistance in understanding, âwhether, when, and how unconscious\nprocesses are truly relevant to daily lifeâ (Friedman & Schustack, 2012).\n","linknr":129,"url":"Content_(Freudian_dream_analysis)","recorded":1362535054,"links":13,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Freudian psychology"],"headings":["Definitions","Parts of the mind and dreams","Interpreting dreams","Modern research on dreams","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Dreams-The_Royal_Road_to_the_Unconscious_.jpg/220px-Dreams-The_Royal_Road_to_the_Unconscious_.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Dreams","Mind","Sigmund_Freud","Psyche","Conscious","Psychoanalytic_theory","Unconscious","Freud","Motivations","Ego","Superego","Id","Nightmares","PTSD","Freud","Psychoanalytic_Theory","Dreams","Unconscious","Conscious","Free_Association","Dream_Interpretation","The_Interpretation_of_Dreams"]}
