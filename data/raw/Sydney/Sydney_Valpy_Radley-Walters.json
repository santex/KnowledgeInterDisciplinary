He was commissioned in the Sherbrooke Fusiliers Regiment in October of\nthat year. The regiment was redesignated 27th Armoured Regiment (The Sherbrooke\nFusiliers Regiment) in January 1942 and embarked for England in October 1942.\n\nThe regiment was part of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade supporting the 3rd\nCanadian Infantry Division landing in Normandy on D-Day 6 June 1944. Captain Radley-\nWalters commanded a tank during the Battle of Normandy. On D-Day + 1, 7 June\n1944, in fighting near Saint-Germain-la-Blanche-Herbe, with the 12th SS Panzer\nDivision, Radley-Walters had his first kill, a Panzer IV. Major Radley-Walters\ncommanded a tank squadron in the regiment. His unit was credited with killing\nthe tank ace \"The Black Baron\" Michael Wittmann of the 101. Schwere SS-\nPanzerabteilung, though which tank in the squadron had the actual kill is\nunknown. This claim has been disputed by 3 Troop, A Squadron, 1st\nNorthamptonshire Yeomanry tank regiment gunner Joe Ekins, who also claims to\nhave killed the Panzer ace. Radley-Walters was awarded both the Distinguished\nService Order and the Military Cross and for his outstanding leadership and\ngallantry as a squadron commander.\n\nHis regiment participated in Operation Market-Garden and broke through and\nrelieved the 101st Airborne Division.\n\nBy the end of the war, he was the top tank ace, the ace of aces of the western\nAllies (and therefore, of Canada), with a total of 18 kills. From July 1945, he\nwas promoted to lieutenant colonel, and commanded the Sherbrooke Fusiliers\nRegiment as part of the Allied Occupation Force.\n\nAfter the war, Radley-Walters served on peacekeeping missions in Cyprus\nand Egypt.\n\nIn 1957, he became the Commanding Officer of the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess\nLouise's). He attended NATO Defence College in Paris and was assigned to the\nSupreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe from June 1961 to July 1962. He\nreturned to Canada as commandant of the Royal Canadian Armoured School in Camp\nBorden. In 1966, he became the Director-General Training and Recruiting at\nCanadian Forces Headquarters in Ottawa.\n\nIn June 1968 he was promoted to brigadier-general and took command of 2 Combat\nGroup at CFB Petawawa. In 1971 he became the commander of the Combat Training\nCentre at CFB Gagetown.\n\nRadley-Walters retired in December 1974. He served eight years as colonel of the\n8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) and in November 1980 became colonel-\ncommandant of the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps.\n\nThere is a two part article discussing Radley-Walters' leadership style in the\nCanadian Military Journal (Vol 9, No 4 and Vol 10, No 1).
