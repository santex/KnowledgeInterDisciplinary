He is known as a powerful musician and a vital groover;\nhis brand of bluesy, funky hard bop was and continues to be profoundly\ninfluential on mainstream jazz. For more than 30 years his band, 'Art Blakey and\nthe Jazz Messengers', included many young musicians who went on to become\nprominent names in jazz. The band's legacy is thus not only known for the music\nit produced, but as a proving ground for several generations of jazz\nmusicians; Blakey's groups are matched only by those of Miles Davis\nin this regard.\n\nBlakey was inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame (in 1982), the Grammy Hall of\nFame (in 2001), and was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.\n","linknr":368,"url":"Art_Blakey","recorded":1362676696,"links":47,"instances":["pianist","musician","jazz_trumpeter","musician","musician","pianist","jazz_pianist","musician","trombonist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1919 births","1990 deaths","ABC Records artists","African-American musicians","African-American Muslims","American Ahmadis","American jazz drummers","American jazz bandleaders","American Muslims","Bebop drummers","Blue Note Records artists","Columbia Records artists","Converts to Islam","Converts to Islam from Christianity","Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winners","Hard bop drummers","Impulse!
