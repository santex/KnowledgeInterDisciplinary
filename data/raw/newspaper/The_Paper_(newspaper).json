{"cursor":"3380","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'The Paper' was a weekly underground newspaper published in East Lansing,\nMichigan beginning in December 1965. It was one of the five original founding\nmembers of the Underground Press Syndicate. Peck, Abe. Uncovering the\nSixties (New York: Pantheon Books, 1985). Started by [[Michigan State\nUniversity]] student Michael Kindman as a radical, counterculture alternative\nto the official MSU campus newspaper, it was sympathetic to the politics of\n[[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]]. Initially\ntolerated by the MSU school administration,The Paper'' briefly received\nfunding from a campus publications board before controversial content caused\nit to be banned from the MSU campus, but it continued to grow in popularity\nafter the ban.\n\nIn the summer of 1966, shortly after the founding of UPS, Kindman met Thorne\nDreyer and Carol Neiman from the University of Texas at an SDS summer project in\nSan Franciscoâand told them about The Paper. Afterward, on their return to\nAustin, Texas they were inspired by Kindman's example to found their own\npioneering radical college underground paper, [[The Rag]], which was to play an\nimportant role in the development of the underground press around the country.\n\nIn the Spring of 1966, MSU students James Friel and Stuart Jones, working from\nan idea by fellow student Steven Badrich, whom they had met at a fund-raising\nparty at Kindman's house, created the comic strip Land Grant Man. Land Grant Man\nwould appear on a nearly weekly basis for the next two years, and sporadically\nafter that. Friel drew all installments of the strip. Jones was succeeded as\nwriter by Jane Munn, and later by several others, including Friel. Land Grant\nMan, beginning in May 1966, was an early example of underground comics, although\nits style owed more to the \"straight\" Marvel comics of the period than to any\ncounter-cultural influence.\n\nThe Paper continued publishing on a regular basis for several years, generally\ncirculating about 5000 copies. In late 1967 founder Michael Kindman left East\nLansing for Boston, where he joined the Mel Lyman cult and briefly served as\nmanaging editor of Boston's leading underground paper, [[Avatar\n(newspaper)|Avatar]], before its demise. \"My Odyssey Through the Underground\nPress\" by Michael Kindman. Voices from the Underground: Insider Histories of the\nVietnam Era Underground Press , ed. Ken Wachsberger (Tempe, AZ: Mica's Press,\n1993), p. 369-479.\n\nThe Paper continued to appear under that name until June 1969. It subsequently\nwent through a number of title changes, including goob yeak gergibal and\nGeneration East Lansing, before merging with another paper, the Bogue Street\nBridge, to form Joint Issue, which lasted until May 20, 1974. The successor to\nJoint Issue was the Lansing Star, a local alternative paper which published at\nfirst weekly and later biweekly and monthly until 1983, when it was succeeded by\nLansing Beat, which survived until at least November 1986.\n","linknr":86,"url":"The_Paper_(newspaper)","recorded":1363123511,"links":["/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File:The_Paper_vol-I_no-1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/The_Paper_vol-I_no-1.png/220px-The_Paper_vol-I_no-1.png","/wiki/File:The_Paper_vol-I_no-1.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","/wiki/Underground_press","/wiki/East_Lansing,_Michigan","/wiki/Underground_Press_Syndicate","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Michigan_State_University","/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society_(1960_organization)","/wiki/Thorne_Webb_Dreyer","/wiki/The_Rag","/wiki/Mel_Lyman","/wiki/Avatar_(newspaper)","#cite_note-2","/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","#cite_ref-2","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&oldid=519249832","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Alternative_press","/wiki/Category:Publications_established_in_1965","/wiki/Category:Underground_culture","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Paper+%28newspaper%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=The+Paper+%28newspaper%29","/wiki/The_Paper_(newspaper)","/wiki/Talk:The_Paper_(newspaper)","#","/wiki/The_Paper_(newspaper)","/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/The_Paper_(newspaper)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/The_Paper_(newspaper)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&oldid=519249832","/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=The_Paper_%28newspaper%29&id=519249832","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=The+Paper+%28newspaper%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=The+Paper+%28newspaper%29&oldid=519249832&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=The_Paper_(newspaper)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paper_(newspaper)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=skins.vector&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Gadget-ReferenceTooltips.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript&508635914","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=scripts&skin=vector&*"],"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Alternative
