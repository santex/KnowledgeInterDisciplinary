{"cursor":"2118","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In naming cultivated plants, a 'Group' (formerly 'cultivar Group') is a formal\nclassification category, under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for\nCultivated Plants]] (ICNCP): :ICNCP Art. 3.1: \"a formal category for assembing\ncultivars, individual plants or assemblages of plants on the basis of defined\nsimilarity.\" [http://www.actahort.org/books/647/647_4.htm International\nCode Of Nomenclature For Cultivated Plants] The term \"Group\" (with a\ncapital G) was introduced in the 2004 ICNCP, replacing the \"Cultivar-group\" of\nthe 1995 ICNCP.\n\nA Group is united by some common trait; for example there may be a Group of yellow-\nflowering cultivars, a Group of cultivars with variegated leaves, a Group of\ncultivars resistant to a particular disease, etc. A cultivar may belong to more\nthan one Group (for example, it may be yellow-flowering, with variegated leaves\nand resistant to the disease at one and the same time).\n\n:ICNCP Art 9, Ex 10: \"Solanum tuberosum 'Desiree' may be designated part of a\nMaincrop Group and a Redskin Group since both such designations may be practical\nto buyers of potatoes ...\" [capitalization in original, as required by\nthe ICNCP]\n\nAnother reason for designating a Group is when a well-known plant loses its\ntaxonomic status (e.g. it ceases to be a \"good\" species or subspecies and\nbecomes a synonym). Its botanical epithet may be retained in a \"Group epithet\".\nFor example, Tetradium hupehense is sometimes regarded as being part of\nTetradium daniellii, and the plants in question may then be referred to as\nTetradium daniellii Hupehense Group.\n\nAs for cultivars, every word in the epithet of a Group name is capitalised\n(Art. 20.3).\n","linknr":87,"url":"Cultivar_group","recorded":1362477997,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Botanical nomenclature","Cultivars|"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Cultigen","Cultivar","Cultivar","Epithet"]}
