The concept of a group is frequently used in tax law,\naccounting and (less frequently) company law to attribute the rights and duties\nof one member of the group to another or the whole. If the corporations are\nengaged in entirely different businesses, the group is called a conglomerate.\n\nIn Germany, where a sophisticated law of the \"concern\" has been developed, the\nlaw of corporate groups is a fundamental aspect of its corporate law. Many other\nEuropean jurisdictions also have a similar approach, while Commonwealth\ncountries and the United States adhere to a formalistic doctrine that refuses to\n\"pierce the corporate veil\": corporations are treated outside tax and accounting\nas wholly separate legal entities.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Business_group","recorded":1362477159,"links":22,"instances":["business","company"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Business terms","Types of business entity","Strategic management"],"headings":["Legal independence","Economic dependence","Law","Definition","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conglomerate","company"],["concern","business"],["concern","business"],["concern","business"],["concern","business"]],"members":["concern","conglomerate"],"related":["Corporations","Tax_law","Accounting","Conglomerate_(company)","Concern_(business)","Law","Corporate_law","Commonwealth","United_States","Pierce_the_corporate_veil","Concern_(business)","Company_group","Financial_statements","Corporate_groups","Company_group","Financial_statements","Mitbestimmungsgesetz","Princeton_University_Press","Keiretsu","Concern_(business)","Hein_Schreuder","United_Arab_Emirates","Trade_association","Adidas","Icelandair_Group","Business_alliance","Concern_(business)","Keiretsu"]}
