Cell groups are generally intended to teach the Bible and personalize\nChristian fellowship. They are always used in cell churches, but also occur in\nparachurch organizations and other interdenominational settings, where they are\nusually referred to as such as 'Bible study groups'. They are known by a variety\nof other names, including 'growth groups', 'connect groups', 'care groups',\n'life groups', 'fellowship groups', 'small groups' and 'home groups'. David\nHunsicker suggests that the \"cell\" group concept in church structure \"is\nbecoming prominent in almost every denomination in American Protestantism.\"\n\nThe cell group differs from the house church in that the group is part of an\noverall church congregation, whereas the house church is a self-contained\ncongregation.\n","linknr":172,"url":"Cell_group","recorded":1362371297,"links":25,"instances":["building","christianity","christian","christianity","biology","christian"],"pdf":["http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wesleyjournal/1996-wtj-31-1.pdf","http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wesleyjournal/1996-wtj-31-1.pdf","http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wesleyjournal/1996-wtj-31-1.pdf","http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wesleyjournal/1996-wtj-31-1.pdf","http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wesleyjournal/1996-wtj-31-1.pdf","http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wesleyjournal/1996-wtj-31-1.pdf"],"categories":["Evangelicalism","Christian behaviour and experience","Christian group structuring"],"headings":["Terminology","History","Structure","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/US_Navy_040615-N-4190W-001_A_women%27s_Bible_study_is_held_in_the_ship%27s_chapel_aboard_the_conventionally_powered_aircraft_carrier_USS_John_F._Kennedy_%28CV_67%29.jpg/320px-US_Navy_040615-N-4190W-001_A_women%27s_Bible_study_is_held_in_the_ship%27s_chapel_aboard_the_conventionally_powered_aircraft_carrier_USS_John_F._Kennedy_%28CV_67%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/P_christianity.svg/31px-P_christianity.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["communion","christian"],["cell","biology"],["good_news","christianity"],["disciple","christianity"],["church","building"],["bible_study","christian"]],"members":["church","good_news","communion","disciple","cell","bible_study"],"related":["Christianity","Christian_Church","Bible","Communion_(Christian)","Cell_church","Parachurch_organization","Interdenominationalism","House_church","Cell_(biology)","Cell_church","Good_news_(Christianity)","Missional_Communities","Disciple_(Christianity)","House_church","New_Testament","Protestant_Reformation","Ulrich_Zwingli","Anabaptists","New_Testament_Greek","Anthony_Horneck","Philipp_Jacob_Spener","First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians","Philipp_Jakob_Spener","Pietism","Conventicle","John_Wesley","Methodist_Circuit","Sanctuary","Church_(building)","Megachurch","Willow_Creek_Community_Church","Alpha_Course","Church_of_England","Roman_Catholic_Church","United_Methodist_Church","Bible_study_(Christian)"]}
