Taste is the sensation produced when a\nsubstance in the mouth reacts chemically with receptors of taste buds. Taste,\nalong with smell (olfaction) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (with touch for\ntexture, also pain, and temperature), determines flavors, the sensory\nimpressions of food or other substances.\n\nHumans perceive taste through sensory organs called taste buds, [http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/taste_buds.html What Are Taste\nBuds?] kidshealth.org or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the top of\nthe tongue.

Elsevier Science USA. taste\nbuds that are located on the back and front of the tongue. Others are located on\nthe roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat.\n\nThe sensation of taste can be categorized into five basic tastes: sweetness,\nsourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami. Taste buds are able to differentiate\nbetween different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules\nor ions. Sweet, umami, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of\nmolecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds.\nSaltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter\ntaste buds, respectively. Human Physiology: An integrated approach 5th\nEdition -Silverthorn, Chapter-10, Page-354\n\nAs taste senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic tastes are\nclassified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the\nthings they sense have on our bodies.
