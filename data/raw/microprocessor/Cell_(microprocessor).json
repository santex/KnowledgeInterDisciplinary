{"cursor":"56506","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Cell' is a microprocessor architecture that combines a general-purpose Power\nArchitecture core of modest performance with streamlined coprocessing\nelements which greatly accelerate multimedia and\nvector processing applications, as well as many other forms of dedicated\ncomputation.\n\nIt was developed by Sony, Sony Computer Entertainment, Toshiba, and IBM, an\nalliance known as \"STI\". The architectural design and first implementation were\ncarried out at the STI Design Center in Austin, Texas over a four-year period\nbeginning March 2001 on a budget reported by Sony as approaching US$400\nmillion. Cell is shorthand for 'Cell Broadband Engine Architecture',\ncommonly abbreviated CBEA in full or Cell BE in part.\n\nThe first major commercial application of Cell was in Sony's PlayStation 3 game\nconsole. Mercury Computer Systems has a dual Cell server, a dual Cell blade\nconfiguration, a rugged computer, and a PCI Express accelerator board available\nin different stages of production. Toshiba had announced plans to incorporate\nCell in high definition television sets, but seems to have abandoned the idea.\nExotic features such as the XDR memory subsystem and coherent Element\nInterconnect Bus (EIB) interconnect appear to position Cell for\nfuture applications in the supercomputing space to exploit the Cell processor's\nprowess in floating point kernels.\n\nThe Cell architecture includes a memory coherence architecture that emphasizes\nefficiency/watt, prioritizes bandwidth over latency, and favors peak\ncomputational throughput over simplicity of program code. For these reasons,\nCell is widely regarded as a challenging environment for software\ndevelopment. IBM provides a comprehensive Linux-based Cell\ndevelopment platform to assist developers in confronting these\nchallenges. Software adoption remains a key issue in whether Cell\nultimately delivers on its performance potential. Despite those challenges,\nresearch has indicated that Cell excels at several types of scientific\ncomputation.\n\n
