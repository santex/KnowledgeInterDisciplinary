{"cursor":"20500","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" (green) in the axons of sympathetic autonomic neurons.]] 'Immunohistochemistry'\n or 'IHC' refers to the process of detecting antigens (e.g., proteins) in cells\n of a tissue section by exploiting the principle of antibodies binding\n specifically to antigens in biological tissues.\n IHC takes its name from the roots \"immuno,\" in reference to antibodies used in\n the procedure, and \"histo,\" meaning tissue (compare to immunocytochemistry).\n\nImmunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells\nsuch as those found in cancerous tumors. Specific molecular markers are\ncharacteristic of particular cellular events such as proliferation or cell death\n(apoptosis). IHC is also widely used in basic research to understand the\ndistribution and localization of biomarkers and differentially expressed\nproteins in different parts of a biological tissue.\n\nVisualising an antibody-antigen interaction can be accomplished in a number of\nways. In the most common instance, an antibody is conjugated to an enzyme, such\nas peroxidase, that can catalyse a colour-producing reaction (see\n[[immunoperoxidase|immunoperoxidase staining]]). Alternatively, the antibody can\nalso be tagged to a fluorophore, such as fluorescein or rhodamine (see\n[[immunofluorescence]]).\n","linknr":467,"url":"Immunohistochemical_staining","recorded":1362481357,"links":32,"instances":["histology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Immunohistochemistry|","Histology","Immunologic tests","Protein methods","Anatomical pathology","Staining","Laboratory techniques"],"headings":["Sample preparation","Sample Labeling","IHC Troubleshooting","Diagnostic IHC markers","Directing therapy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Immunohistochemistry.png/220px-Immunohistochemistry.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Immunohistochemicalstaining1.PNG/300px-Immunohistochemicalstaining1.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Immunohistochemicalstaining2.PNG/300px-Immunohistochemicalstaining2.PNG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Kidney_cd10_ihc.jpg/220px-Kidney_cd10_ihc.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["fixation","histology"]],"members":["fixation"],"related":["Axons","Autonomic_Nervous_System","Antibody","Antigen","Biological_tissue","Immunocytochemistry","Apoptosis","Peroxidase","Fluorophore","Fluorescein","Rhodamine","Fixation_(histology)","Paraformaldehyde","Îœm","Microtome","Microtome","Immunocytochemistry","Triton_X-100","Surface_tension","Bovine_serum_albumin_","Polyclonal_antibodies","Monoclonal_antibodies","Epitope","Biotin","Fluorescence","Alkaline_phosphatase","Horseradish_peroxidase","Diaminobenzidine","BCIP","Nitro_blue_tetrazolium_chloride","Nickel","Fluorescein_isothiocyanate","Rhodamine","Staining","Antibody","Fluorescein_isothiocyanate","Antiserum","Antigen","Antibody","Antigen","Secondary_antibody","IgG","Enzyme","Biotin","Avidin","Streptavidin","NeutrAvidin","Hematoxylin","Hoechst_stain","DAPI","Neurosciences","Immunoblotting","Molecular_weight","Western_Blot","Surgical_pathology","Carcinoembryonic_antigen","Adenocarcinoma","Cytokeratin","Cluster_of_differentiation","Hodgkin's_disease","Alpha_fetoprotein","Yolk_sac_tumor","Hepatocellular_carcinoma","CD117","Gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor","CD10","Renal_cell_carcinoma","Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia","Prostate_specific_antigen","Prostate_cancer","Estrogens","Progesterone","B-cell","Lymphomas","CD20","T-cell","Lymphomas","CD3","Tamoxifen","Imatinib","Tyrosine_kinase","Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia","Gastrointestinal_stromal_tumor","Monoclonal_antibody","Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor","HER2/neu","Ventana_Medical_Systems","Erbitux","Cutaneous_conditions_with_immunofluorescence_findings","University_of_Rochester"]}
