{"cursor":"23505","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n as viewed from the World Trade Center in 1988]]\n\n\n'Smog' is a type of air pollution; the word \"smog\" was coined in the early 20th\ncentury as a portmanteau of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky\nfog. The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known\nas pea soup fog, a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century\nto the mid 20th century. This kind of smog is caused by the burning of large\namounts of coal within a city; this smog contains soot particulates from smoke,\nsulfur dioxide and other components. Modern smog, as found for example in Los\nAngeles, is a type of air pollution derived from vehicular emission from\ninternal combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere\nwith sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary\nemissions to form photochemical smog. The atmospheric pollution levels of Los\nAngeles, Mexico City and other cities are increased by inversion that traps\npollution close to the ground.\n","linknr":548,"url":"Photochemical_smog","recorded":1362508700,"links":76,"instances":["fuel","meteorology"],"pdf":["http://ega.web.psi.ch/Piazzesi,%20PhD%20thesis,%20ETH%20Zurich,%202006.pdf","http://www.ccme.ca/assets/pdf/pn_1257_e.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/memoranda/rg701.pdf","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6V7X-48XDN58-3H-1&_cdi=5854&_user=7209612&_pii=0160412081901136&_origin=search&_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1981&_sk=999949998&view=c&wchp=dGLzVzz-zSkzV&md5=b5a34a715396bf9618677e5f389bd00b&ie=/sdarticle.pdf","http://airnet.iras.uu.nl/products/pdf/airnet_wg3_toxicology_report.pdf"],"categories":["Smog|"],"headings":["Origin
