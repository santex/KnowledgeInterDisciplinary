Circumstantial evidence, by contrast, consists of a fact\nor set of facts which, if proven, will support the creation of an inference that\nthe matter asserted is true.

A witness who testifies that he saw the defendant fleeing\nthe scene of the crime, or a forensics expert who says that ballistics proves\nthat the defendantâs gun shot the bullet that killed the victim both give\ncircumstantial evidence from which the defendantsâs guilt may be inferred.\n\nIn direct evidence a witness relates what he or she directly experienced.\n(Usually the experience is by sight or hearing, though it may come though any\nsense, including touch or pain.
