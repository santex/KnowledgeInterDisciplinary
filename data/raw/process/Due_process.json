{"cursor":"19820","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Due process' is the legal requirement that the state must respect all of the\nlegal rights that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of law of\nthe land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a\nperson without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due-\nprocess violation, which offends against the rule of law.\n\nDue process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal\nproceedings (see substantive due process), so that judges - instead of\nlegislators - may define and guarantee fundamental fairness, justice, and\nliberty. This interpretation has proven controversial, and is analogous to the\nconcepts of natural justice, and procedural justice used in various other\njurisdictions. This interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a\ncommand that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them\nphysically.\n\nDue process is not used in contemporary English law, though two similar concepts\nare natural justice (which generally applies only to decisions of administrative\nagencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions) and the British\nconstitutional concept of the rule of law as articulated by A. V. Dicey and\nothers. Marshall, 69. However, neither concept\nlines up perfectly with the American theory of due process, which, as explained\nbelow, presently contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern\nconcepts of due process in England. Marshall,\n69â70.\n\nDue process developed from clause 39 of the Magna Carta in England. When English\nand American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England, but\ndid become incorporated in the Constitution of the United States.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Due_process","recorded":1362477433,"links":32,"instances":["law","judge"],"pdf":["http://www.constitution.org/18th/coke2nd1797/coke2nd1797_051-100.pdf","http://students.law.umich.edu/mlr/archive/105/2/hawkins.pdf","http://students.law.umich.edu/mlr/archive/105/2/hawkins.pdf"],"categories":["Legal doctrines and principles","Legal terms"],"headings":["By jurisdiction","See also","Notes","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["john_holt","judge"],["custom","law"]],"members":["custom","john_holt"],"related":["Legal_rights","Law_of_the_land","Rule_of_law","Law","Legal_process","Substantive_due_process","Natural_justice","Procedural_justice","Natural_justice","Rule_of_law","A._V._Dicey","Magna_Carta","Constitution_of_the_United_States","Magna_Carta","John_of_England","Law_of_the_land","Rule_of_law","British_people","Monarchs","Edward_III_of_England","Edward_Coke","Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain","King's_Bench","British_House_of_Commons","Newgate_Prison","John_Holt_(judge)","House_of_Lords","United_Kingdom","English_law","United_States","Lawrence,_Kansas","Parliamentary_supremacy","Judicial_review","John_Campbell,_1st_Baron_Campbell","Law_of_the_United_States","Natural_justice","Rule_of_law","A._V._Dicey","Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution","United_States_Constitution","Due_Process_Clause","Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States","Substantive_due_process","Void_for_vagueness","Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights","World_War_II","Louis_Earl_Goodman","Tule_Lake_Segregation_Center","California_Alien_Land_Law_of_1913","Barack_Obama","National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012","United_States_Government","United_States","AUMF","Custom_(law)","International_law","Citizens","National_treatment","Human_rights","Treaty","Continuance","Fair_procedure","Fundamental_justice","Peremptory_norm","Subpoena_ad_testificandum","Subpoena_duces_tecum"]}
