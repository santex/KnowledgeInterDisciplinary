They exist to further the foreign and domestic\npolicies of their governing body, and to defend that body and the nation it\nrepresents from external and internal aggressors. In broad usage, the terms\n\"armed forces\" and \"military\" are often treated synonymously, although in\ntechnical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed\nforces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. 'Armed\nforce' is the use of armed forces to achieve political objectives.\n\nThe study of the use of armed forces is called military science. Broadly\nspeaking, this involves considering offense and defense at three \"levels\":\nstrategy, operational art, and tactics. All three levels study the application\nof the use of force in order to achieve a desired objective.\n","linknr":267,"url":"Armed_forces","recorded":1362585323,"links":54,"instances":["disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military| A"],"headings":["Organization","Benefits and costs","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Military_expenditure_percent_of_GDP.svg/200px-Military_expenditure_percent_of_GDP.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/2007_top_10_countries_by_military_expenditure_MER.svg/200px-2007_top_10_countries_by_military_expenditure_MER.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Bluetank.png/32px-Bluetank.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["military_rule","disambiguation"]],"members":["military_rule"],"related":["Country","Government","Military","Paramilitary","Military_science","Strategy","Operational_art","Military_tactics","Military","Military_branch","Paramilitary","Stockholm_International_Peace_Research_Institute","Mercenary","Militaria","Military_fiat","Military_history","Military_incompetence","Military_intelligence","Military_dictatorship","Military_junta","Military_rule_(disambiguation)","Military_Aid_to_the_Civil_Power","Military_Aid_to_the_Civil_Community","Civil-military_relations","List_of_militaries_by_country","List_of_militaries_that_recruit_foreigners","List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures","List_of_countries_by_number_of_active_troops","List_of_countries_by_size_of_armed_forces","List_of_countries_without_an_army","List_of_air_forces","List_of_armies","List_of_navies"]}
