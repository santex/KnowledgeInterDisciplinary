{"cursor":"32056","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'War bonds' are debt securities issued by a government for the purpose of\nfinancing military operations during times of war. War bonds generate capital\nfor the government and make civilians feel involved in their national\nmilitaries. This system is also useful as a means of controlling inflation in\nsuch an overstimulated economy by removing money from circulation until\nhopefully after the war is concluded. At that point, the funds could be\nliquidated and serve as a stimulus to encourage consumer spending for the\neconomy transitioning to peacetime activity. Exhortations to buy war bonds\nare often accompanied with appeals to patriotism and conscience. Government-\nissued war bonds tend to have a yield which is below market value and are\noften made available in a wide range of denominations to make them affordable\nto all citizens.\n","linknr":482,"url":"War_bond","recorded":1362555836,"links":34,"instances":["scottish_politician","german_empire","finance"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Military economics","Military terminology","Government bonds"],"headings":["Before World War I","World War I","World War II","Notes","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Put_it_into_National_War_Bonds.jpg/170px-Put_it_into_National_War_Bonds.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Und_Ihr_Zeichnet_7_Kriegsanleihe_Crisco_restoration_and_colours.jpg/170px-Und_Ihr_Zeichnet_7_Kriegsanleihe_Crisco_restoration_and_colours.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/So_hilft_dein_Geld.jpg/170px-So_hilft_dein_Geld.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/LibertyBond-WinsorMcCay.jpg/170px-LibertyBond-WinsorMcCay.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/GiveUsTheTools.jpg/170px-GiveUsTheTools.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/FourFavorites1101.jpg/170px-FourFavorites1101.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/15px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["security","finance"],["reichstag","german_empire"],["united_kingdom_coalition_government","1916–1922"],["tom_johnston","scottish_politician"]],"members":["united_kingdom_coalition_government","tom_johnston","reichstag","security"],"related":["Security_(finance)","Inflation","Economic_stimulus","Consumer_spending","Jakob_Fugger","Nathan_Mayer_Rothschild","War_of_1812","Consols","Austria-Hungary","Military_history_of_Canada_during_World_War_I","Reichstag_(German_Empire)","David_Lloyd_George","Bank_holiday","Currency_and_Bank_Notes_Act_1914","Walter_Leaf","Consols","Reginald_McKenna","H._H._Asquith","Bonar_Law","United_Kingdom_coalition_government_(1916–1922)","Tom_Johnston_(Scottish_politician)","Neville_Chamberlain","Secretary_of_the_Treasury","William_Gibbs_McAdoo","Committee_on_Public_Information","Al_Jolson","Elsie_Janis","Mary_Pickford","Douglas_Fairbanks","Charlie_Chaplin","Boy_Scouts_of_America","Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA","Massachusetts_Historical_Society","Henry_Morgenthau,_Jr.","World_War_II","Military_history_of_Canada_during_the_Second_World_War","Nazi_Germany","National_War_Finance_Committee","Bank_of_Montreal","Bank_of_Canada","If_Day","Winnipeg","Manitoba","Nazi_Germany","Czechoslovakian","National_Savings_Movement","War_effort","War_Office","Nazi_Germany","Poland","Denmark","Norway","Belgium","Netherlands","France","World_War_II","Franklin_D._Roosevelt","John_Maynard_Keynes","Liberty_Bonds","Hirohito","Adolf_Hitler","Benito_Mussolini","Series_E_bond","War_savings_stamps","Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","War_Advertising_Council","Warner_Brothers","Norman_Rockwell","Center_on_Conscience_&_War","Peace_churches","Mennonite","Church_of_the_Brethren","Religious_Society_of_Friends"]}
