{"cursor":"8259","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, 'valence bond (VB) theory' is one of two basic theories, along\nwith molecular orbital (MO) theory, that were developed to use the methods of\nquantum mechanics to explain chemical bonding. It focuses on how the atomic\norbitals of the dissociated atoms combine to give individual chemical bonds when\na molecule is formed. In contrast, molecular orbital theory has orbitals that\ncover the whole molecule. {{cite book\n| last1 = Murrel first1 = J.N. last2= Kettle first2= S.F.A. last3= Tedder\n| first3= J.M. title = The Chemical Bond edition= 2nd publisher = John Wiley &\n| Sons year = 1985 location = isbn = 0-471-90759-6}}\n","linknr":172,"url":"Valence_bond_theory","recorded":1362665093,"links":24,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding"],"headings":["History","Theory","VB theory today","Applications of VB theory","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resonance","chemistry"],["valence","chemistry"],["resonance","chemistry"],["basis_set","chemistry"]],"members":["valence","basis_set","resonance"],"related":["Chemistry","Molecular_orbital_theory","Quantum_mechanics","Chemical_bond","Atomic_orbital","G._N._Lewis","Lewis_structure","Walter_Heitler","Fritz_London","Hydrogen","Walter_Heitler","Schrödinger_equation","Wavefunction","Covalent_bond","Fritz_London","Linus_Pauling","Resonance_(chemistry)","Orbital_hybridization","Charles_Coulson","Valence_(chemistry)","Lewis_structure","Resonance_(chemistry)","Atomic_orbitals","Chemical_bond","Probability","Electrons","Ground_state","Sigma_bond","Pi_bond","Orbital_hybridization","Molecular_orbital","Molecular_orbital","Magnetism","Aromaticity","Spin_coupling","Pi_bond","Mathematics","Modern_valence_bond_theory","Basis_set_(chemistry)","Electron_correlation","Hartree–Fock","Modern_valence_bond_theory"]}
