This was Morbid Angel's last album under the label\nGiant Records before the company filed for bankruptcy. The band then re-signed\nwith their former label, Earache Records.\n\nThe original cover is shown here. Today, a different cover exists with the\npicture shown at a different angle. Initial copies came in a green jewelcase.\nThere was also a limited edition \"Slime Pack\" planned, which was never\nreleased after several packs leaked before shipping and the slime-substance\nwas found to be toxic.\n\nA music video was produced for the song \"Where the Slime Live\".\n\nDavid Vincent left the band soon after the release of Domination and was\nreplaced by Steve Tucker. Vincent returned to the band in 2004 but it would not\nbe until the release of [[Illud Divinum Insanus]] in 2011 that he would appear\non new Morbid Angel recordings.\n","linknr":160,"url":"Domination_(Morbid_Angel_album)","recorded":1362688970,"links":32,"instances":["recorded_music","warner","band"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1995 albums","Earache Records albums","Morbid Angel albums"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Morbid_Angel_-_Domination.jpg/220px-Morbid_Angel_-_Domination.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Star_full.svg/11px-Star_full.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Star_empty.svg/11px-Star_empty.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["giant_records","warner"],["giant_records","warner"],["laibach","band"],["audio_mixing","recorded_music"]],"members":["audio_mixing","giant_records","laibach"],"related":["Morbid_Angel","Death_metal","Earache_Records","Giant_Records_(Warner)","Allmusic","Allmusic","Death_metal","Morbid_Angel","Giant_Records_(Warner)","Earache_Records","Music_video","Steve_Tucker","2001_in_music","Trey_Azagthoth","David_Vincent","Erik_Rutan","Laibach_(band)","God_of_Emptiness","David_Vincent","Bass_guitar","Singing","Trey_Azagthoth","Guitar","Keyboard_instrument","Erik_Rutan","Pete_Sandoval","Drum_kit","Record_producer","Bill_Kennedy","Audio_mixing_(recorded_music)","Audio_mastering"]}
