Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in\nthe functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological\nand physical response to food.\n\nThe operation is prescribed to treat morbid obesity (defined as a body mass\nindex greater than 40), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, and other\ncomorbid conditions. [[Bariatric surgery]] is the term encompassing all of the\nsurgical treatments for morbid obesity, not just gastric bypasses, which make up\nonly one class of such operations. The resulting weight loss, typically\ndramatic, markedly reduces comorbidities. The long-term mortality rate of\ngastric bypass patients has been shown to be reduced by up to\n40%. As with all surgery, complications occur. A study\nfrom 2005â€“2006 revealed that 15% of patients experience complications as a\nresult of gastric bypass, and 0.5% of patients died within six months of surgery\ndue to complications.\n","linknr":576,"url":"Gastric_bypass_surgery","recorded":1362484976,"links":25,"instances":["disorder","anatomy"],"pdf":["http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Bariatric_Surgery/marginalulcer.pdf","http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Bariatric_Surgery/marginalulcer.pdf","http://www.asbs.org/html/pdf/2004_ASBS_Consensus_Conference_Statement.pdf"],"categories":["Bariatrics","Obesity","Digestive system surgery"],"headings":["Surgical indications","US insurance coverage requirements","Surgical techniques","Physiology","Complications","Results and health benefits of gastric bypass","Living with gastric bypass","Surgeon accreditation","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Gastric_Bypass%2C_Roux_en-Y.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lumen","anatomy"],["pica","disorder"]],"members":["pica","lumen"],"related":["Stomach","Small_intestine","Morbid_obesity","Body_mass_index","Type_2_diabetes","Hypertension","Sleep_apnea","Comorbid","Obesity","National_Institutes_of_Health","Laparoscopy","Consensus_conferences","American_Society_for_Bariatric_Surgery","Incisional_hernia","Surgical_staple","Fistula","GI_tract","Ligament_of_Treitz","Lumen_(anatomy)","Cholecystokinin","Duodenum","PYY","GLP-1","Ileum","Resting_energy_expenditure","Sleeve_gastrectomy","Reactive_hypoglycemia","Obstructive_sleep_apnea","Diabetes_mellitus","Pulmonary_embolism","Peritonitis","Abscess","Nosocomial_infection","Pneumonia","Sepsis","Venous_thrombosis","Hernia","Internal_hernia","Adhesions","Anastomosis","Gainesville,_Florida","PDF","Ischemia","Gastric_acid","Smoking","Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug","Proton_pump_inhibitor","Esomeprazole","Cytoprotectant","Buffering_agent","Sucralfate","Pyloric_valve","Gastric_dumping_syndrome","Hyperparathyroidism","Vitamin_D","Calcium_citrate","Iron_deficiency","Ferrous_sulfate","Ferrous_fumarate","Chelation","Parenteral","Zinc_deficiency","Eczema","Thiamine","Wernicke's_encephalopathy","Polyneuropathy","Vitamin_B12","Intrinsic_factor","Gastric_mucosa","Pernicious_anemia","Neuropathies","Cyanocobalamin","Malnutrition","Vitamin_A","Jejunoileal_bypass","Duodenal_switch","Orlistat","Folate","Parietal_cell","Achlorhydria","Hydrogen_breath_test","Probiotic","Gluconate","Calcium_carbonate","Vitamin_K","Pica_(disorder)","Hyperlipidemia","Essential_hypertension","Obstructive_sleep_apnea","Diabetes_mellitus_type_2","Gastroesophageal_reflux_disease","Belt_lipectomy","Liposuction","American_College_of_Surgeons","Adjustable_gastric_banding_surgery","Duodenal_Switch","Vagotomy","StomaphyX","American_Society_for_Bariatric_Surgery"]}
