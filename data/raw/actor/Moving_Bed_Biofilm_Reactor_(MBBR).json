{"cursor":"60632","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":". ]] 'Sewage treatment' is the process of removing contaminants from\nwastewater and household sewage, both runoff (effluents), domestic, commercial\nand institutional. It includes physical, chemical, and biological processes to\nremove physical, chemical and biological contaminants. Its objective is to\nproduce an environmentally safe fluid waste stream (or treated effluent) and a\nsolid waste (or treated sludge) suitable for disposal or reuse (usually as farm\nfertilizer). Using advanced technology it is now possible to re-use sewage\neffluent for drinking water, although Singapore is the only country to implement\nsuch technology on a production scale in its production of NEWater.
