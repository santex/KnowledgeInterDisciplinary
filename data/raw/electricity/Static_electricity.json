{"cursor":"30468","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n'Static electricity' is an excess of electric charge trapped on the surface of\nan object. The charge remains until it is allowed to escape to an object with a\nweaker or opposite electrical charge, such as the ground, by means of an\nelectric current or electrical discharge. Static electricity is named in\ncontrast with current electricity, which flows through wires or other conductors\nand transmits energy.\n\nA static electric charge is created whenever two surfaces come into contact and\nseparate, and at least one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical\ncurrent (and is therefore an electrical insulator). The effects of static\nelectricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and even\nsee the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large\nelectrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess\ncharge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon\nof a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is\ncaused by the neutralization of charge.\n","linknr":487,"url":"Static_electricity","recorded":1362485545,"links":54,"instances":["electrical","electricity","unit","physics"],"pdf":["http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2004/PAR0402.pdf","http://www.csb.gov/completed_investigations/docs/Barton%20Case%20Study%20-%209.18.2008.pdf","http://www.chevronglobalaviation.com/docs/aviation_tech_review.pdf","http://www.wolfsonelectrostatics.com/01_hazards/pdfs/guidanceforplantengineers-staticelectricity.pdf","http://140.194.76.129/publications/armytm/tm5-689/c-8.pdf","http://www.aecouncil.com/Papers/aec1.pdf","http://www.wolfsonelectrostatics.com/01_hazards/pdfs/guidanceforplantengineers-staticelectricity.pdf"],"categories":["Electrostatics","Electricity"],"headings":["Causes
