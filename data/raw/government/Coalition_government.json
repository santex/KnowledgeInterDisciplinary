{"cursor":"21103","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nA 'coalition government' (known in the United States as a 'fusion\nadministration') is a cabinet of a parliamentary government in which several\npolitical parties cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within\nthat coalition. The usual reason given for this arrangement is that no party on\nits own can achieve a majority in the parliament. A coalition government might\nalso be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis, for example during\nwartime, or economic crisis, to give a government the high degree of perceived\npolitical legitimacy, or collective identity it desires whilst also playing a\nrole in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have\nformed 'all-party coalitions' (national unity governments, grand coalitions).\nIf a coalition collapses, a confidence vote is held or a motion of no\nconfidence is taken.\n","linknr":431,"url":"Coalition_government","recorded":1362375041,"links":43,"instances":["australia","canadian_historian","united_kingdom","federal_republic","uk","government","politician","political_party","indonesia","government","australia","government","indonesia","geopolitical","japan","canada","uk","political_science","uk"],"pdf":["http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf","http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf"],"categories":["Coalition
