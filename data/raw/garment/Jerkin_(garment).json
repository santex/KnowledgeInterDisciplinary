The term is also applied to a similar sleeveless garment worn by the\n British Army in the twentieth century.\n\nThe stock phrase, '[[buff jerkin]]', refers to an oiled oxhide jerkin, as worn\nby soldiers.\n\nThe origin of the word is unknown. The Dutch word jurk, a child's frock, often\ntaken as the source, is modern, and represents neither the sound nor the sense\nof the English word.\n","linknr":311,"url":"Jerkin_(garment)","recorded":1362563014,"links":18,"instances":["clothing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Jackets","History of clothing (Europe)"],"headings":["Sixteenth and seventeenth centuries","Twentieth century","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Dudleyportrait.jpg/220px-Dudleyportrait.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Martin_Frobisher_by_Ketel.jpg/54px-Martin_Frobisher_by_Ketel.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/WalterRaleighandson.jpg/73px-WalterRaleighandson.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Musician_Holding_Bagpipes_1632.jpg/91px-Musician_Holding_Bagpipes_1632.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/St_george_civic_guard_hals.jpg/75px-St_george_civic_guard_hals.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/62/PD-icon.svg/12px-PD-icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["doublet","clothing"]],"members":["doublet"],"related":["Jacket","Leather","Sleeve","Doublet_(clothing)","British_Army","Stock_phrase","Dutch_language","Frock","Martin_Frobisher","Sir_Walter_Raleigh","Frans_Hals","World_War_I","Wool","World_War_II","Bakelite","Normandy_landings","PVC","1550–1600_in_fashion","1600–1650_in_fashion","Janet_Arnold"]}
