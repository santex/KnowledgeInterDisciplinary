The first side is \"Possession\", which is the same version from their\nearlier single, \"Don't Look Down on Me\".\n\nOn the flip side is \"Evil Temptation\", an instrumental. Like many of Iron\nButterfly's songs from the Heavy era, \"Evil Temptation\" is extremely simple,\nbased entirely on a single riff. The lineup is mostly unknown, though Erik Brann\nhas been confirmed as the guitarist. Doug Ingle denies having played on the\nrecording, and has pointed out that the drumming sounds distinctly unlike Ron\nBushy. It is quite plausible that, Brann's guitar work aside, the recording is\nactually the work of studio musicians. However, the song itself is an Iron\nButterfly composition, and a version with lyrics by Darryl DeLoach was performed\nduring the band's early tours.\n","linknr":152,"url":"Possession_(Iron_Butterfly_song)","recorded":1362570389,"links":16,"instances":["iron_butterfly_album"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1967 singles","Iron Butterfly songs","Acid rock songs","Psychedelic rock songs"],"headings":["Track listing","Personnel","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Evil_TemptationFrontCover.jpg/220px-Evil_TemptationFrontCover.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Musical_notes.svg/30px-Musical_notes.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["heavy","iron_butterfly_album"],["heavy","iron_butterfly_album"]],"members":["heavy"],"related":["Iron_Butterfly","Heavy_(Iron_Butterfly_album)","Psychedelic_rock","Acid_rock","EMI","Stateside_Records","Doug_Ingle","Iron_Butterfly","Don't_Look_Down_on_Me","Heavy_(Iron_Butterfly_album)","Doug_Ingle","Ron_Bushy","Studio_musician","Darryl_DeLoach","Doug_Ingle","Iron_Butterfly","Doug_Ingle","Darryl_DeLoach","Danny_Weis","Jerry_Penrod","Ron_Bushy","Erik_Brann"]}
