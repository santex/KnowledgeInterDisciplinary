While some of Moby's earlier work garnered\ncritical and commercial success within the electronic dance music scene, Play\nwas both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. The album introduced\nMoby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit\nsingles (that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years), but\nalso through unprecedented licensing of his music in films, television, and\ncommercial advertisements. It eventually became the biggest-selling album of its\ngenre, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.

According to [[Rolling Stone]], \"Play wasn't\nthe first album to make a rock star out of an insular techno nerdnik, but it was\nthe first to make one a pop sensation. [...] Play made post-modernism cuddly,\nslowly but surely striking a chord with critics and record-buyers\nalike.\"\n\nOne of the notable aspects of Play, as opposed to other electronic albums of the\ntime, was the way in which it combined old gospel and folk music rhythms with\nmodern house sensibilities. Moby sampled heavily from the collected field\nrecordings of Alan Lomax in songs such as \"Honey\", \"Find My Baby\", and \"Natural\nBlues\", while the track \"Run On\" was inspired by the traditional \"God's Gonna\nCut You Down\". The album also has more purely electronic tracks, as well as the\nrock-influenced single \"South Side\" and the more ambient \"Porcelain\". In 2003,\nthe album was ranked number 341 on [[Rolling Stone]] magazine's list of the 500\ngreatest albums of all time.\n\nIt was nominated for both a Grammy Award and Brit Award, was the UK's biggest\nselling independent album of 2000, and certified platinum status in more than 20\ncountries. {{cite book\n| first= David last= Roberts year= 2006 title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n|
