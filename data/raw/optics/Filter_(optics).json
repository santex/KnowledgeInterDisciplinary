{"cursor":"11810","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Optical filters' are devices that selectively transmit light of different\nwavelengths, usually implemented as plane glass or plastic devices in the\noptical path which are either dyed in the bulk or have interference coatings.\n\nFilters mostly belong to one of two categories. The simplest, physically, is the\nabsorptive filter; interference or dichroic filters can be quite complex.\n\nOptical filters selectively transmit light in a particular range of wavelengths,\nthat is, colours, while blocking the remainder. They can usually pass long\nwavelengths only (longpass), short wavelengths only (shortpass), or a band of\nwavelengths, blocking both longer and shorter wavelengths (bandpass). The\npassband may be narrower or wider; the transition or cutoff between maximal and\nminimal transmission can be sharp or gradual. There are filters with more\ncomplex transmission characteristic, for example with two peaks rather than a\nsingle band; [http://www.schneiderkreuznach.com/pdf/filter/b-\nw_filter_transmission_curves.pdf Transmission curves of many filters for\nmonochrome photography, Schneider]. See Redhancer 491 for a very complex curve\nwith many peaks these are more usually older designs traditionally used\nfor photography; filters with more regular characteristics are used for\nscientific and technical work.\n\nOptical filters are commonly used in photography (where some special effect\nfilters are occasionally used as well as absorptive filters), in many optical\ninstruments, and to colour stage lighting. In astronomy optical filters are used\nto restrict light passed to the spectral band of interest, e.g., to study\ninfrared radiation without visible light which would affect film or sensors and\noverwhelm the desired infrared.\n\nPhotographic filters are a particular case of optical filters, and much of\nthe material here applies. Photographic filters do not need the accurately\ncontrolled optical properties and precisely defined transmission curves of\nfilters designed for scientific work, and sell in larger quantities at\ncorrespondingly lower prices than many laboratory filters. Some\nphotographic effect filters, such as star effect filters, are not relevant\nto scientific work.\n","linknr":209,"url":"Filter_(optics)","recorded":1362896638,"links":31,"instances":["polarizer","waves","signal_processing","wave_propagation","electronics","optics"],"pdf":["http://www.schneiderkreuznach.com/pdf/filter/bw_filter_transmission_curves.pdf"],"categories":["Optical filters"],"headings":["Absorptive","Dichroic filter","Monochromatic","Infrared","Ultraviolet","Neutral density","Longpass","Bandpass","Shortpass","Guided-mode resonance filters","Metal mesh filters","Polarizer","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Filter-optics-1.jpg/320px-Filter-optics-1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interference","optics"],["absorption","electromagnetic_radiation"],["filter","photography"],["filter","photography"],["absorption","optics"],["interference","wave_propagation"],["solid_state","electronics"],["polarization","waves"],["polarization","waves"],["polaroid","polarizer"],["filter","photography"],["filter","signal_processing"]],"members":["polaroid","polarization","filter","interference","solid_state","absorption"],"related":["Optical_path","Interference_(optics)","Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)","Dichroic_filters","Wavelength","Colour","Filter_(photography)","Optical","Stage_lighting","Astronomy","Filter_(photography)","Transmission_curve","Glass","Inorganic_chemistry","Organic_chemistry","Absorption_(optics)","Plastic","Polycarbonate","Polymethyl_methacrylate","Color_gel","Dichroic_filters","Optical_coating","Interference_(wave_propagation)","Dichroic_prism","Camera","Fabry–Pérot_interferometer","Etalon","Telecommunications_networks","Wavelength_division_multiplexing","Optic_fiber","Monochromatic_filter","Infrared_photography","Infrared_cut-off_filter","Visible","Incandescent_light_bulb","Slide_projector","Overhead_projector","Solid_state_(electronics)","Charge-coupled_device","Neutral_density_filter","Optical_density","Transmission_coefficient","Depth_of_field","Low_pass_filter","Electronic_filter","Ångström","Lyot_filter","Fabry-Pérot_interferometer","Spectral_line","Dutch_Open_Telescope","Swedish_Solar_Telescope","Grating","Polarization_(waves)","Metal_mesh_optical_filters","Polarizer","Polarization_(waves)","Polaroid_(polarizer)","Sunglasses","Photography","Angling","Specular_reflection","Stereogram","Filter_(photography)","Filter_(signal_processing)","Filter_fluorometer","Lyot_filter","Dichroic_filter","Dichroic_prism","Atomic_line_filter","Warm_filter","Metal_mesh_optical_filters"]}
