{"cursor":"1668","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'clone()' is a system call in the Linux kernel that creates a child\nprocess that may share parts of its execution context with the parent. It is\noften used to implement multithreading. In practice, clone() is not often called\ndirectly, but instead using a threading library (such as pthreads) that uses\nclone() when starting a thread (such as during a call to pthread_create()).\n\nThe syntax for calling clone under a Linux program is:  #include  int clone (int (*fn) (void *), void *child_stack,\nint flags, void *arg);  clone creates a new thread that\nstarts with the function pointed to by the fn argument (as opposed\nto fork() which continues with the next command after fork() .)\nThe child_stack argument is a pointer to a memory space to be used\nas the stack for the new thread (which must be malloc'ed before that; on most\narchitectures stack grows down, so the pointer should point at the end of the\nspace), flags specify what gets inherited from the parent process,\nand arg is the argument passed to the function. It returns the\nprocess ID of the child process or -1 on failure.\n","linknr":219,"url":"Clone_(Linux_system_call)","recorded":1362569902,"links":14,"instances":["operating_system","computer_science","computing","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linux","Operating system APIs"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["process","computing"],["context","computing"],["thread","computer_science"],["fork","operating_system"]],"members":["fork","thread","context","process"],"related":["System_call","Linux_kernel","Process_(computing)","Context_(computing)","Thread_(computer_science)","POSIX_Threads","Fork_(operating_system)","Call_stack","Malloc","Child_process","Native_POSIX_Thread_Library","POSIX","POSIX_Threads"]}
