{"cursor":"7947","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"For most file systems, a program initializes access to a file in a filesystem\nusing the 'open' system call. This allocates resources associated to the file\n(the file descriptor), and returns a handle that the process will use to refer\nto that file. In some cases the open is performed by the first access.\n\nThe same file may be opened simultaneously by several processes, and even by the\nsame process (resulting in several file descriptors for the same file) depending\non the file organization and filesystem. Operations on the descriptors like\nmoving the file pointer, or closing it are independent (they do not affect other\ndescriptors for the same file). Operations of the file (like a write) can be\nseen by operations on the other descriptors (a posterior read can read the\nwritten data).\n\nDuring the open, the filesystem may allocate memory for buffers (or it may wait\nuntil the first operation).\n\nThe absolute filename is resolved. This may include connecting to a remote host\nand notifying an operator that a removable media is required. It may include the\ninitialization of a communication device. At this point an error may be returned\nif the host or media is not available. The first access to at least the\ndirectory within the filesystem is performed. An error will usually be returned\nif the higher level components of the path (directories) cannot be located or\naccessed. An error will be returned if the file is expected to exist and it does\nnot or if the file should not already exist and it does.\n\nIf the file is expected to exist and it does, the file access, as restricted by\npermission flags within the file meta data or access control list, are validated\nagainst the requested type of operations. This usually requires an additional\nfilesystem access although in some filesystems meta flags may be part of the\ndirectory structure.\n\nIf the file is being created the filesystem may allocate the default initial\namount of storage or a specified amount depending on the file system\ncapabilities. If this fails an error will be returned. Updating the directory\nwith the new entry may be performed or it maybe delayed until the close is\nperformed.\n\nVarious other errors which may occur during the open include directory update\nfailures, un-permitted multiple connections, media failures, communication link\nfailures and device failures.\n\nThe return value must always be examined and an error specific action taken.\n\nIn many cases programming language specific run-time library opens may perform\nadditional actions including initializing a run-time library structure related\nto the file.\n\nAs soon as a file is no longer needed, the program should close it. This will\ncause run-time library and filesystem buffers to be updated to the physical\nmedia and permit other processes to access the data if exclusive use had been\nrequired. Some run-time libraries may close a file if the program calls the run-\ntime exit. Some filesystems may perform the necessary operations if the program\nterminates. Neither of these is likely to take place in the event of a kernel or\npower failure. This can cause damaged filessytem structures requiring the\nrunning of privileged and lengthy filesystem utilities during which the entire\nfile system may be inaccessible.\n","linknr":118,"url":"Open_(system_call)","recorded":1363434330,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/File_system","/wiki/Computer_file","/wiki/Filesystem","/wiki/System_call","/wiki/File_descriptor","/wiki/Smart_pointer#Handles","/wiki/Close_(system_call)","#open_call_arguments","#perl_language_form","#C_library_POSIX_definition","#path","#oflag","#mode","#See_also","#Notes","#References","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Pathname","/wiki/Close_(system_call)","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=2","#cite_note-perlTieArray-1","#cite_note-perlTieHash-2","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=3","http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html","/wiki/POSIX","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=4","/wiki/File_path","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/Mask_(computing)#Arguments_to_functions","/wiki/Fcntl.h","/wiki/Errno.h","http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html","http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fopen.html","http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fgets.html","http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fputs.html","http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fclose.html","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/File_permissions","/wiki/Umask","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/File_descriptor","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=8","#cite_ref-perlTieArray_1-0","http://perldoc.perl.org/Tie/File.html","http://perldoc.perl.org/Tie/File.html","#cite_ref-perlTieHash_2-0","http://perldoc.perl.org/AnyDBM_File.html","http://perldoc.perl.org/AnyDBM_File.html","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit&section=9","/wiki/Special:BookSources/8178080966","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&oldid=544184539","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:C_POSIX_library","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Open+%28system+call%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Open+%28system+call%29","/wiki/Open_(system_call)","/wiki/Talk:Open_(system_call)","#","/wiki/Open_(system_call)","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Open_(system_call)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Open_(system_call)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&oldid=544184539","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Open_%28system_call%29&id=544184539","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Open+%28system+call%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Open+%28system+call%29&oldid=544184539&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Open_(system_call)&printable=yes","//cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_(syst%C3%A9mov%C3%A9_vol%C3%A1n%C3%AD)","//www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:ItemByTitle/enwiki/Open
