{"cursor":"15286","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In embryology, 'cleavage' is the division of cells in the early embryo. The\nzygotes of many species undergo rapid cell cycles with no significant growth,\nproducing a cluster of cells the same size as the original zygote. The different\ncells derived from cleavage are called blastomeres and form a compact mass\ncalled the morula. Cleavage ends with the formation of the blastula.\n\nDepending mostly on the amount of yolk in the egg, the cleavage can be\n'holoblastic' (total or entire cleavage) or 'meroblastic' (partial cleavage).\nThe pole of the egg with the highest concentration of yolk is referred to as the\nvegetal pole while the opposite is referred to as the animal pole.\n\nCleavage differs from other forms of cell division in that it increases the\nnumber of cells without increasing the mass. This means that with each\nsuccessive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material\nincreases.\n","linknr":339,"url":"Cleavage_(embryo)","recorded":1362540630,"links":34,"instances":["cell_biology","biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Developmental biology"],"headings":["Mechanism","Types of cleavage","Mammals","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Equal_vs_unequal_cleavage.jpg/220px-Equal_vs_unequal_cleavage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Spiral_cleavage_in_Trochus.png/600px-Spiral_cleavage_in_Trochus.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/HumanEmbryogenesis.svg/300px-HumanEmbryogenesis.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["aster","cell_biology"],["cell","biology"],["aster","cell_biology"]],"members":["aster","cell"],"related":["Embryology","Cell_(biology)","Embryo","Zygote","Cell_cycle","Blastomere","Morula","Blastula","Yolk","Vegetal_pole","Animal_pole","Cell_division","Cyclin","Cyclin-dependent_kinase","Cyclin_B","Cdc2","Maturation_promoting_factor","Karyokinesis","Cytokinesis","Central_spindle","Aster_(cell_biology)","Tubulin","Microtubules","Centrosomes","Contractile_ring","Actin","Microfilaments","Midblastula","Protostomes","Cell_(biology)","Embryo","Morphogenesis","Embryo","Deuterostomes","Isolecithal","Centrolecithal","Deuterostomes","Vertebrate","Echinoderm","Oocyte","Mammal","Isolecithal","Lophotrochozoa","Spiralia","Annelid","Mollusc","Sipuncula","Zygote","Oogenesis","Aster_(cell_biology)","Cytokinesis","Monotremes","Birds","Reptiles","Fish","Telolecithal","Mitosis","Cytokinesis","Arthropods","Centrolecithal","Tunicate","Sea_urchin","Amphioxus","Amphibian","Mammal","Annelid","Mollusk","Fish","Sauropsida","Monotreme","Insect","Placentalia","Trophoblast","Chorion","Inner_cell_mass","Blastocyst","Embryogenesis","James_W._Valentine","MadSci_Network","Xenopus_laevis","MRI"]}
