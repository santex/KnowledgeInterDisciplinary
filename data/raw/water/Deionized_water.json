In recent decades, a combination of\n the above processes have come into use to produce water of such high purity\n that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts\n per trillion (ppt). Purified water has many uses, largely in science and\n engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of\n purities. Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water which\n has been treated (\"rendered potable\") to neutralize, but not necessarily remove\n contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals.\n\nDistilled water is produced by a process of distillation and has an electrical\nconductivity of not more than 11 ÂµS/cm and total dissolved solids of less than\n10 mg/litre. Distillation involves boiling the water and then\ncondensing the vapour into a clean container, leaving solid contaminants behind.\nDistillation produces very pure water. A white or yellowish mineral scale is\nleft in the distillation apparatus, which requires regular cleaning.\nDistillation alone does not guarantee the absence of bacteria in drinking water\nunless containers are also sterilized. For many procedures more economical\nalternatives are available such as deionized water and, is used in place of\ndistilled water.\n","linknr":317,"url":"Deionized_water","recorded":1362372255,"links":35,"instances":["unit","electrolytic"],"pdf":["http://www.image2output.com/user_resources/TextFiles/pdfs/Deionised_Water.pdf","http://www.image2output.com/user_resources/TextFiles/pdfs/Deionised_Water.pdf","http://www.high-q.com/pdf/astm_d1193_critique.pdf","http://www.high-q.com/pdf/astm_d1193_critique.pdf","http://www.safetymgmt.com/AIGRiskTools/Knowledge_Center/General_Industry/ELECTRICAL_SAFETY.pdf","http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf","http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf"],"categories":["Liquid water","Distillation","Drinking water","Coolants","Liquid dielectrics","Water supply","Excipients"],"headings":["Purification methods","Uses","Health effects of drinking purified water","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Aqua-distillata.jpg/200px-Aqua-distillata.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Drinking_water.jpg/18px-Drinking_water.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["conductivity","electrolytic"],["siemens","unit"]],"members":["siemens","conductivity"],"related":["Real_Farmacia","Madrid","Water","Distilled_water","Reverse_osmosis","Carbon_filtration","Microfiltration","Ultrafiltration","Ultraviolet","Oxidation","Electrodialysis","Conductivity_(electrolytic)","Siemens_(unit)","Boiling","Vapour","Distillation","Biochemistry","Water","Cation","Sodium","Calcium","Iron","Copper","Anion","Chloride","Sulfate","Ion-exchange_resin","Gram-negative","Electrodeionization","Reverse_osmosis","Carbon_filtration","Hydroxide","Hydronium","Bleach","Ratio","Technical_standard","American_Chemical_Society","ASTM_International","Clinical_and_Laboratory_Standards_Institute","United_States_Pharmacopeia","International_Organization_for_Standardization","Electrical_conductivity","Silica","Tin","Lead-acid_batteries","Steam_iron","Limescale","Aquarium","Methanol","Engine_knocking","Boeing_707","International_Nomenclature_of_Cosmetic_Ingredients","Dielectric_constant","Pulsed_power","Sandia_National_Laboratories","Z_Machine","Humidors","Bacteria","Mold","Humidifier","Membrane_technology","Drinking_water","Electrolyte","Mmol/L","Dental_fluorosis","Reverse_osmosis","Volatile_organic_compounds","Fluoride","Homeostasis","Calcium","Magnesium","Sodium","Hard_water","Heart_disease","Public_water_supply","Fluoridation","Opposition_to_water_fluoridation","Hydrogen_production","Ionized_water","Water_ionizer","Electrodeionization","Atmospheric_water_generator","Heavy_water","Water_softening","Milli-Q"]}
