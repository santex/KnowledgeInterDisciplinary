{"cursor":"29362","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" village.]] 'Groundwater' is water located beneath the earth's surface in soil\n pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an\n unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity\n of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock\n become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater\n is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; natural\n discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands.\n Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal and industrial\n use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the\n distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called\n groundwater hydrology.\n\nTypically, groundwater is thought of as liquid water flowing through shallow\naquifers, but technically it can also include soil moisture, permafrost (frozen\nsoil), immobile water in very low permeability bedrock, and deep geothermal or\noil formation water. Groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication that can\npossibly influence the movement of faults. It is likely that much of the Earth's\nsubsurface contains some water, which may be mixed with other fluids in some\ninstances. Groundwater may not be confined only to the Earth. The formation of\nsome of the landforms observed on Mars may have been influenced by groundwater.\nThere is also evidence that liquid water may also exist in the subsurface of\nJupiter's moon Europa.
