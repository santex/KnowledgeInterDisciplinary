Following the explosion and sinking of the ''Deepwater\nHorizon'' oil rig, which claimed 11 lives, a sea-\nfloor oil gusher flowed unabated for three months in 2010. The gushing wellhead\nwas not capped until after 87 days, on 15 July 2010. The total discharge is estimated\nat .\n\nA massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands, and estuaries from the\nspreading oil, using skimmer ships, floating boom, controlled burns, and of\nCorexit oil dispersant. After several failed efforts to\ncontain the flow, the well was capped and declared sealed on 19 September\n2010. However, the months of spill, along with response and\ncleanup activities, caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and\nthe Gulf's fishing and tourism industries, as well as\nhuman health problems. Environmental and health\nconsequences are continuing, with study and investigation ongoing. Some reports\nindicate the well site may be continuing to leak.\n\nNumerous investigations have explored the causes of the explosion and spill.\nNotably, the U.S. government's September 2011 report pointed to defective\ncement work on the well, finding BP most at fault but also faulting Deepwater\nHorizon operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton. Earlier in 2011, a White House\ncommission likewise blamed BP and its partners for making a series of cost-\ncutting decisions and not having a system sufficient to ensure well safety, but\nalso concluded that the spill was not an isolated incident caused by \"rogue\nindustry or government officials,\" but resulted from \"systemic\" root causes\nand, \"absent significant reform in both industry practices and government\npolicies, might well recur.\"\n\nThe disaster spawned over 130 private lawsuits as well as civil and criminal\nfederal prosecutions. In November 2012, BP settled the federal case by pleading\nguilty to 11 counts of manslaughter related to the explosion and fire, and\nagreeing to pay a record breaking $4.525 billion in fines and other\npayments. BP faces other potential\nenormous payouts to thousands of fishermen, businesses and others harmed by the\nspill. In November 2012 the EPA announced that BP will be temporarily banned\nfrom seeking new contracts with the US government because of the company's \"lack\nof business integrity\" during the disaster.\n","linknr":2063,"url":"Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill","recorded":1362512324,"links":113,"instances":["modu","fish","shipboard","satellite","medicine","containment","well_drilling","machine"],"pdf":["http://www.register-iri.com/forms/upload/Republic_of_the_Marshall_Islands_DEEPWATER_HORIZON_Marine_Casualty_Investigation_Report-Low_Resolution.pdf","http://www.register-iri.com/forms/upload/Republic_of_the_Marshall_Islands_DEEPWATER_HORIZON_Marine_Casualty_Investigation_Report-Low_Resolution.pdf","http://www.uscg.mil/foia/docs/dwh/fosc_dwh_report.pdf","http://www.uscg.mil/foia/docs/dwh/fosc_dwh_report.pdf","http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2010/10/06/18/_Staff_Report_No._4.source.prod_affiliate.91.pdf","http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2010/10/06/18/_Staff_Report_No._4.source.prod_affiliate.91.pdf","http://mcbi.marine-conservation.org/publications/pub_pdfs/Norse-and-Amos-2010.pdf","http://mcbi.marine-conservation.org/publications/pub_pdfs/Norse-and-Amos-2010.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42942.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42942.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/cms-filesystem-action?file=user_files/aja/2010gl044689-combined.pdf","http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/cms-filesystem-action?file=user_files/aja/2010gl044689-combined.pdf","http://school.judsonisd.org/webpages/ameeks/files/Science%20Around%20the%20World%208-16-2010.pdf","http://school.judsonisd.org/webpages/ameeks/files/Science%20Around%20the%20World%208-16-2010.pdf","http://www.energyclaims.net/assets/Macondo-well-PC&R.pdf","http://www.energyclaims.net/assets/Macondo-well-PC&R.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants/directive-addendum2.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants/directive-addendum2.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants/statement-dispersant-use-may24.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants/statement-dispersant-use-may24.pdf","http://www.strategicsciencesworkinggroup.com/omeka-1.2.1/archive/files/08132010sciencekintisch_0c67e8dae0.pdf","http://www.strategicsciencesworkinggroup.com/omeka-1.2.1/archive/files/08132010sciencekintisch_0c67e8dae0.pdf","http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/Hydrates/2012reports/nt0005667-nas-valentine.pdf","http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/Hydrates/2012reports/nt0005667-nas-valentine.pdf","http://www.harteresearchinstitute.org/images/press_releases/biodiversity.pdf","http://www.harteresearchinstitute.org/images/press_releases/biodiversity.pdf","http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/bulletins/pdfs/2010/FB10-055_BP_Oil_Spill_Closure_062110.pdf","http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/bulletins/pdfs/2010/FB10-055_BP_Oil_Spill_Closure_062110.pdf","http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf","http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf","http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/sites/default/files/McDonell-64-Stan-L-Rev-765.pdf","http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/sites/default/files/McDonell-64-Stan-L-Rev-765.pdf","http://media.nola.com/2010_gulf_oil_spill/other/BDO%20Executive%20Summary.pdf","http://media.nola.com/2010_gulf_oil_spill/other/BDO%20Executive%20Summary.pdf","http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/incident_response/STAGING/local_assets/downloads_pdfs/Deepwater_Horizon_Accident_Investigation_Report.pdf"],"categories":["Deepwater
