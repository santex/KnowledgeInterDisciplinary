{"cursor":"10705","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nA 'spectrometer' ('spectrophotometer', 'spectrograph' or 'spectroscope') is an\ninstrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, typically used in spectroscopic analysis to identify\nmaterials. The variable measured is most often the light's intensity\nbut could also, for instance, be the polarization state. The independent\nvariable is usually the wavelength of the light or a unit directly proportional\nto the photon energy, such as wavenumber or electron volts, which has a\nreciprocal relationship to wavelength. A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy\nfor producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities.\nSpectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very\nwide range of wavelengths, from gamma rays and X-rays into the far infrared. If\nthe instrument is designed to measure the spectrum in absolute units rather than\nrelative units, then it is typically called a spectrophotometer. The majority of\nspectrophotometers are used in spectral regions near the visible spectrum.\n\nIn general, any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of\nthis total range because of the different techniques used to measure\ndifferent portions of the spectrum. Below optical frequencies (that is, at\nmicrowave and radio frequencies), the spectrum analyzer is a closely related\nelectronic device.\n","linknr":258,"url":"Spectrometers","recorded":1362560574,"links":55,"instances":["optics","waves","optics","optics","physics","optics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Spectrometers|","Electronic test equipment","Signal processing","Measuring instruments","Laboratory equipment"],"headings":["Spectroscopes","Spectrographs","Mass spectrometer","See also","References","Bibliography","External links",""],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Spectrometer_schematic.gif/300px-Spectrometer_schematic.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Spektrometr.jpg/220px-Spektrometr.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Optical_spectrometers.png/220px-Optical_spectrometers.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Units_visible_spectrum.png/550px-Units_visible_spectrum.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5c/Units_IR_spectrum.png/550px-Units_IR_spectrum.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Simple_spectroscope.jpg/200px-Simple_spectroscope.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intensity","physics"],["polarization","waves"],["triangular_prism","optics"],["dispersion","optics"],["photometry","optics"],["prism","optics"]],"members":["triangular_prism","polarization","photometry","prism","intensity","dispersion"],"related":["Light","Electromagnetic_spectrum","Spectroscopic_analysis","Intensity_(physics)","Polarization_(waves)","Wavelength","Photon","Wavenumber","Electron_volt","Spectroscopy","Spectral_line","Wavelength","Gamma_ray","X-ray","Far_infrared","Absolute_units","Relative_units","Spectrophotometer","Visible_spectrum","Microwave","Radio","Spectrum_analyzer","Mass_spectrograph","Astronomy","Chemistry","Triangular_prism_(optics)","Diffraction_grating","Photodetector","Computer","Joseph_von_Fraunhofer","Gustav_Robert_Kirchhoff","Robert_Bunsen","Caesium","Rubidium","Fraunhofer_lines","Incandescence","Light","Sodium","Sodium_vapor_lamp","Collimating_lens","Amici_prism","Refraction","Dispersion_(optics)","Photographic_film","Photomultiplier","Abscissa","Frequency_spectrum","Photographic_paper","Stellar_classification","Main_sequence","Hubble's_law","Hubble_sequence","Phytochrome","Charge-coupled_device","Ultraviolet","Echelle_spectrograph","Diffraction_grating","Blazed_grating","Spherical_aberration","Polychromator","Monochromator","List_of_light_sources","Photometry_(optics)","Spectroscopy","Circular_Dichroism","Mass_spectrometer","Monochromator","Scanning_Mobility_Particle_Sizer","Prism_(optics)"]}
