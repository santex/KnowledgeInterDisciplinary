Like the\nchoriamb, in classical quantitative verse the ionic never appears in passages\nmeant to be spoken rather than sung. James Halporn, Martin Ostwald, and\nThomas Rosenmeyer, The Meters of Greek and Latin Poetry (Hackett, 1994,\noriginally published 1963), pp. 29â31. \"Ionics\" may refer inclusively to\npoetry composed of the various metrical units of the same total quantitative\nlength (six morae) that may be used in combination with ionics proper: ionics,\nchoriambs, and anaclasts. Halporn et al., Meters, p. 125. Equivalent\nforms exist in English poetry.\n","linknr":166,"url":"Ionic_meter","recorded":1362537951,"links":10,"instances":["linguistics","poetry","poet","grammarian","foot","phonetics","prosody"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Poetic rhythm","Metrical feet","Ancient Greek poetry"],"headings":["Examples of ionics","Ionic ''a minore'' and ''a maiore''","Polyschematist sequences","In English","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["meter","poetry"],["mora","linguistics"],["inversion","prosody"],["syncope","phonetics"],["hephaestion","grammarian"],["edward_fitzgerald","poet"],["iamb","foot"]],"members":["mora","meter","edward_fitzgerald","hephaestion","iamb","syncope","inversion"],"related":["Syllable","Meter_(poetry)","Syllable_weight","Ancient_Greek_poetry","Latin_poetry","Choriamb","Quantitative_verse","Mora_(linguistics)","Inversion_(prosody)","English_poetry","Alcman","Sappho","Alcaeus_of_Mytilene","Anacreon","Aeschylus","Euripides","Dochmiac","Cybele","Dionysus","Horace","Archilochus","Paul_Shorey","Anacreontics","Syncope_(phonetics)","Galliambic","Catalectic","Tetrameter","Catullus","Attis","Hephaestion_(grammarian)","Aeolic_verse","Syllable","Hellenistic_poetry","Sotades","M._L._West","Ennius","Edward_FitzGerald_(poet)","Lyric_poetry","Stanza","Thomas_Hardy","Thomas_Hardy","Scansion","Iamb_(foot)","W._B._Yeats","Tennyson","Pyrrhic"]}
