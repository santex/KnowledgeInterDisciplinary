{"cursor":"7142","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nA 'voltmeter' is an instrument used for measuring electrical potential\ndifference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a\npointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital\nvoltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital\nconverter.\n\nVoltmeters are made in a wide range of styles. Instruments permanently mounted\nin a panel are used to monitor generators or other fixed apparatus. Portable\ninstruments, usually equipped to also measure current and resistance in the form\nof a multimeter, are standard test instruments used in electrical and\nelectronics work. Any measurement that can be converted to a voltage can be\ndisplayed on a meter that is suitably calibrated; for example, pressure,\ntemperature, flow or level in a chemical process plant.\n\nGeneral purpose analog voltmeters may have an accuracy of a few percent of full\nscale, and are used with voltages from a fraction of a volt to several thousand\nvolts. Digital meters can be made with high accuracy, typically better than 1%.\nSpecially calibrated test instruments have higher accuracies, with laboratory\ninstruments capable of measuring to accuracies of a few parts per million.\nMeters using amplifiers can measure tiny voltages of microvolts or less.\n\nPart of the problem of making an accurate voltmeter is that of calibration to\ncheck its accuracy. In laboratories, the Weston Cell is used as a standard\nvoltage for precision work. Precision voltage references are available based on\nelectronic circuits.\n","linknr":198,"url":"Voltmeter","recorded":1362540234,"links":58,"instances":["measuring_instrument"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Electrical meters","Measuring instruments","Electronic test equipment","Voltmeters|"],"headings":["Analog voltmeter","VTVMs and FET-VMs","Digital voltmeter","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Voltmeter_hg.jpg/220px-Voltmeter_hg.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Galvanometer_diagram.svg/220px-Galvanometer_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Voltmeter.jpg/200px-Voltmeter.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["potentiometer","measuring_instrument"]],"members":["potentiometer"],"related":["Electrical_potential","Analog_to_digital_converter","Multimeter","Amplifier","Weston_Cell","D'Arsonval","Galvanometer","Ammeter","Rectifier","Electrostatic_voltmeter","Field-effect_transistor","Multimeter","Andrew_Kay","Kaypro","Analog-to-digital_converter","Integrating_ADC","Voltage_reference","Weston_cell","Electrical_measurements","Electrometer","Electronic_test_equipment","Metrology","Multimeter","Ohmmeter","Potentiometer_(measuring_instrument)","Solenoid_voltmeter","Voltage_divider","Class_of_accuracy_in_electrical_measurements"]}
