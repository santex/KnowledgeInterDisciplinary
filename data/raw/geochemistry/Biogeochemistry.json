{"cursor":"6482","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Biogeochemistry' is the scientific discipline that involves the study of the\nchemical, physical, geological, and biological processes and reactions that\ngovern the composition of the natural environment (including the biosphere, the\nhydrosphere, the pedosphere, the atmosphere, and the lithosphere). In\nparticular, biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements,\nsuch as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into\nliving things transported through earth scale biological systems in space\nthrough time. The field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or\nhave an impact on biological activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the\nstudy of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus cycles. Biogeochemistry is a\nsystems science closely related to systems ecology.\n","linknr":255,"url":"Biogeochemistry","recorded":1362372408,"links":31,"instances":["soil_study"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Environmental chemistry","Chemical oceanography","Geochemistry","Systems ecology","Biogeochemistry|","Earth sciences","Global change","Science","Biology","Geology","Biochemistry","Systems science"],"headings":["History","Early development","Research","See also","References","Representative books and publications","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Vernadsky.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg/32px-Aegopodium_podagraria1_ies.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Earth_flag_PD.jpg/32px-Earth_flag_PD.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/DirkvdM_rocks.jpg/32px-DirkvdM_rocks.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg/32px-Sustainable_development.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pedology","soil_study"]],"members":["pedology"],"related":["Chemistry","Physics","Geology","Biology","Biosphere","Hydrosphere","Pedosphere","Earth's_atmosphere","Lithosphere","Biogeochemical_cycle","Chemical_element","Carbon","Nitrogen","Life","Carbon_cycle","Nitrogen_cycle","Sulfur_cycle","Phosphorous_cycle","Systems_thinking","Systems_ecology","Russians","Vladimir_Ivanovich_Vernadsky","Mendeleev","Riemman","Evolution","Anthropocene","Limnology","Geochemistry","G._Evelyn_Hutchinson","James_Lovelock","Feedback","Atmospheric_sciences","Biology","Ecology","Geomicrobiology","Environmental_chemistry","Geology","Oceanography","Soil_science","Earth_science","Environmental_science","Biogeochemical_cycle","Chemical_element","Carbon","Oxygen","Nitrogen","Phosphorus","Sulfur","Stable_isotope","Trace_element","Trace_metal","Radionuclide","Scientific_model","Eutrophication","Carbon_sequestration","Global_change","Climate_change","Prospecting","Acid_rain","ADEPD","Biosphere","Biogeochemical_cycle","Carbon_sink","Ecology","Ecosystem_model","Edaphology","Environmental_chemistry","Environmental_engineering_science","Geochemistry","Geomicrobiology","GEOTRACES","Global_change","IMBER","Noosphere","Pedology_(soil_study)","Physical_impacts_of_climate_change","American_Geophysical_Union"]}
