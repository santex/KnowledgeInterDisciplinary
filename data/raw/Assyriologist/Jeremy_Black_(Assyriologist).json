He was the only son of tea-taster Dudley Black and\nJoan nÃ©e Denton. At age two he was isolated for a whole year in hospital with\npolio, then at age five he suffered the death of his mother.\n\nAfter his attendance at Slough Grammar School for Boys, in 1969 Black went to\nOxford University as Exhibitioner in Classics to Worcester College. At Oxford he\nbecame interested in the ancient languages and cultures of Mesopotamia, and\nafter qualifying changed his studies to Sumerian and Akkadian under Professor\nOliver Gurney. Black's (still unpublished) BA dissertation was entitled âA\nHistory of Nippur, from the Earliest Times to the End of the Kassite Periodâ:\nthis work was utilised in the very beginning of S.W. Cole's book Nippur in Late\nAssyrian Times, ca. 745-612 B.C., 1996, where it is described as the âonly\nsystematic treatment of Nippur's early historyâ. In 1975 Black attained his\nBPhil in Cuneiform Studies.\n\nFor postgraduate studies, partly supervised by Edmond Sollberger of the British\nMuseum, and with the continuing guidance of Gurney at Oxford, Black wrote his\nDPhil dissertation on âAncient Babylonian Grammatical Theoryâ, submitted in 1980\nand later published under the title Sumerian Grammar in Babylonian Theory, Rome\n1984, 2nd edition 1991. A.R. George has described it as âthe only book-length\nexamination of the linguistic thinking that underpinned the BabyloniansÂ´\nunderstanding of Sumerianâ.\n\nWhile completing his DPhil dissertation, Black took a position with St\nCatherineÂ´s Foundation at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park. In 1981,\nhowever, he was enabled to return full-time to the field of Assyriology by his\nappointment to a Research Associate post at the Oriental Institute of the\nUniversity of Chicago to work on the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary Project (see\nacknowledgement of his contribution on the title pages of volumes 17/Å  [1989-\n1992] and 14/R [1999]).\n\nIn 1982 Black took up the post of Assistant Director of the 'British\nArchaeological Expedition to Iraq', the Baghdad wing of the British School of\nArchaeology in Iraq, succeeding Michael Roaf, who had been elevated to the\ndirectorship. Following the resignation of Roaf in late 1985, Black was\nappointed Director, which post he held until early 1988.\n\nIn Iraq Black served as epigrapher on a number of archaeological expeditions,\nand in Baghdad carried out research in the Iraq Museum, where he worked\nespecially on the tablets (cuneiform documents) discovered in the earlier major\nBritish excavations at Ur and Nimrud; the latter were published in J.A. Black\nand D. J. Wiseman, Cuneiform Tablets from Nimrud, 4: Literary Texts from the\nTemple of NabÃ», London 1996. Black also collaborated on Assyriological works\nwith Iraqi scholars, notably with Farouk Al-Rawi, and with other colleagues from\nthe days in Baghdad: the book Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia:\nAn Illustrated Dictionary (co-authored with Anthony Green, illustrated by Tessa\nRickards, London and Austin 1992, 2nd edition 1998) grew out of such an\nassociation. Also in Iraq, Black met and married the British archaeologist Ellen\nMcAdam (later divorced).\n\nBenefitting from the recommendations of the 1986 Parker Report into Asian and\nAfrican Studies in Universities in the UK, in 1988 Oxford University was able to\nre-establish a full-time lectureship in Assyriology (absent since the retirement\nof Gurney in 1978). The new post, known as University Lecturer in Akkadian, was\nawarded to Black, who was also elected a Fellow of Wolfson College.\n\nBack in Oxford â apart from periods devoted to full administrative duties,\nfirst as Senior Proctor of the University, 1995â1996, then as Chairman of the\nBoard of the Faculty of Oriental Studies, 1999â2001, Black was free to develop\nhis studies in Sumerian literature, literary criticism and philology. Most\nnotable was the publication of his Reading Sumerian Poetry, Oxford 1988. In the\nassessment of A.R. George, this book âdisplays ... a real sensitivity to\nSumerian imageryâ. Black also collaborated with Andrew R. George and J.\nNicholas Postgate on A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian, 1999 (reprinted 2000).\nHe actively participated in other scholarly projects, such as those of the\ninternational âSumerian Grammar Groupâ and the GrÃ¶ningen-based âMesopotamian\nLiterature Groupâ.\n\nFrom 1997, with initial funding from the Leverhulme Trust, and later from the\nArts and Humanities Research Board, Black founded and administered what may well\ncome to be considered his greatest legacy, the Internet-based âElectronic Text\nCorpus of Sumerian Literatureâ. Work by the project team continued after Black's\ndeath, although active funding was ended in mid-2006.\n\nThe 'Jeremy Allen Black Trust for Assyriology', a fund to support young\nAssyriologists, was established by the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Oxford\nUniversity in his memory.\n\nTowards the end of his life Black had the pleasurable discovery of, and contact\nwith, his half-brother, Peter Mitchell (the son of Dudley by his first wife),\nliving in the British Virgin Islands.\n","linknr":164,"url":"Jeremy_Black_(Assyriologist)","recorded":1368978978,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(Assyriologist)&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","/wiki/Isleworth","/wiki/Middlesex","/wiki/Alma_mater","/wiki/University_of_Oxford","/wiki/Doctoral_advisor","/wiki/Oliver_Gurney","/wiki/Oxford","/wiki/United_Kingdom","/wiki/Assyriologist","/wiki/Sumerologist","/wiki/Electronic_Text_Corpus_of_Sumerian_Literature","/wiki/Isleworth","/wiki/Middlesex","/wiki/England","/wiki/Buckinghamshire","/wiki/Tea_tasting","/wiki/Poliomyelitis","/wiki/Slough_Grammar_School#Slough_Grammar_School_for_Boys_.281936.E2.80.931982.29","/wiki/Oxford_University","/wiki/Classics","/wiki/Worcester_College","/wiki/Mesopotamia","/wiki/Sumer","/wiki/Akkadian_language","/wiki/Oliver_Gurney","/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts","/wiki/Dissertation","/wiki/Nippur","/w/index.php?title=Kassite_Period&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/BPhil","/w/index.php?title=Cuneiform_Studies&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Postgraduate","/w/index.php?title=Edmond_Sollberger&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/British_Museum","/wiki/DPhil","/wiki/Babylonian","/w/index.php?title=St_Catherine%C2%B4s_Foundation&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Cumberland_Lodge","/wiki/Windsor_Great_Park","/wiki/Assyriology","/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Oriental_Institute","/wiki/University_of_Chicago","/wiki/Chicago_Assyrian_Dictionary","/wiki/Baghdad","/wiki/British_School_of_Archaeology_in_Iraq","/wiki/Michael_Roaf","/wiki/Iraq","/wiki/Epigrapher","/w/index.php?title=Archaeological_expeditions&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Iraq_Museum","/wiki/Clay_tablet","/wiki/Cuneiform","/wiki/Ur","/wiki/Nimrud","/wiki/Donald_Wiseman","/w/index.php?title=Farouk_Al-Rawi&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Green_(Near_Eastern_archaeologist)&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Ellen_McAdam&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Parker_Report_(1986)&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/UK","/wiki/Wolfson_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Proctor","/wiki/Oriental_Studies","/wiki/Literature","/wiki/Literary_criticism","/wiki/Philology","/wiki/Imagery_(literature)","/wiki/Andrew_R._George","/w/index.php?title=J._Nicholas_Postgate&action=edit&redlink=1","/w/index.php?title=Sumerian_Grammar_Group&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Gr%C3%B6ningen","/w/index.php?title=Mesopotamian_Literature_Group&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Leverhulme_Trust","/wiki/Arts_and_Humanities_Research_Board","/wiki/Internet","/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands","/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)&action=edit&section=1","http://www-etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk","/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/The_Independent","/wiki/Authority_control","/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File","http://viaf.org/viaf/100168217","/wiki/Wikipedia:Persondata","/wiki/Isleworth","/wiki/Middlesex","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)&oldid=523452713","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:1951_births","/wiki/Category:2004_deaths","/wiki/Category:English_historians","/wiki/Category:English_Assyriologists","/wiki/Category:Alumni_of_Worcester_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:Fellows_of_Wolfson_College,_Oxford","/wiki/Category:People_from_Ealing","/wiki/Category:People_from_Slough","/wiki/Category:People_educated_at_Slough_Grammar_School","/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_with_VIAF_identifiers","/wiki/Category:Persondata_templates_without_short_description_parameter","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jeremy+Black+%28assyriologist%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Jeremy+Black+%28assyriologist%29","/wiki/Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)","/wiki/Talk:Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)","#","/wiki/Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)","/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Jeremy_Black_(assyriologist)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.22wmf3/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_c
