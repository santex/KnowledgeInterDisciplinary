{"cursor":"10897","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" binary.]]\n\nA 'Binary code' is a way of representing text or computer processor instructions\nby the use of the binary number system's two-binary digits 0 and 1. This is\naccomplished by assigning a bit string to each particular symbol or instruction.\nFor example, a binary string of eight binary digits (bits) can represent any of\n256 possible values and can therefore correspond to a variety of different\nsymbols, letters or instructions.\n\nIn computing and telecommunication, binary codes are used for any of a variety\nof methods of encoding data, such as character strings, into bit strings. Those\nmethods may be fixed-width or variable-width. In a fixed-width binary code, each\nletter, digit, or other character, is represented by a bit string of the same\nlength; that bit string, interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in\ncode tables in octal, decimal or hexadecimal notation. There are many character\nsets and many character encodings for them.\n\nA bit string, interpreted as a binary number, can be translated into a decimal\nnumber. For example, the lowercase \"a\" as represented by the bit string\n01100001, can also be represented as the decimal number 97.\n","linknr":212,"url":"Binary_code","recorded":1362671086,"links":28,"instances":["computer","logic","computing","computer_science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Encodings","Computer data"],"headings":["History of binary code","Other forms of binary code","Coding systems","Early uses of binary codes","Current uses of binary","Weight of binary codes","See also","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Wikipedia_in_binary.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["instruction","computer_science"],["string","computing"],["boolean_algebra","logic"],["z1","computer"]],"members":["z1","boolean_algebra","string","instruction"],"related":["Plain_text","Instruction_(computer_science)","Binary_number_system","Binary_digit","Bit","String_(computing)","Bit","Encoding","Character_string","Variable-length_code","Binary_number","Octal","Decimal","Hexadecimal","Character_sets","Character_encoding","Bit","Pingala","Eugene_Paul_Curtis","I_ching","George_Boole","Boolean_algebra_(logic)","Claude_Shannon","Braille","Taoist","Cosmology","Yin_and_yang","King_Wen_sequence","Yoruba_people","Nigeria","Yoruba_religion","Orisa","Orunmila","Babalawo","Traditional_African_medicine","UNESCO","Masterpieces_of_the_Oral_and_Intangible_Heritage_of_Humanity","ASCII","Binary-coded_decimal","Linotype_machine","C._E._Wynn-Williams","Konrad_Zuse","Z1_(computer)","Alan_Turing","Atanasoff-Berry_Computer","George_Stibitz","Constant-weight_code","Hamming_weight","Binary_number","List_of_binary_codes","Binary_file","Unicode"]}
