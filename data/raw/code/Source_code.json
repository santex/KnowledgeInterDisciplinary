The source code of a program is specially designed to\nfacilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be\nperformed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often\ntransformed by a compiler program into low-level machine code understood by the\ncomputer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time.\nAlternatively, an interpreter can be used to analyze and perform the effects of\nthe source code program directly on the fly.\n\nMost computer applications are distributed in a form that includes executable\nfiles, but not their source code. If the source code were included, it would be\nuseful to a user, programmer, or system administrator, who may wish to modify\nthe program or understand how it works.\n\nAside of its machine-readable forms, source code also appears in books and other\nmedia; often in the form of small code snippets, but occasionally complete code\nbases; a well-known case is the source code of PGP.\n","linknr":286,"url":"Source_code","recorded":1362671085,"links":73,"instances":["computer_scientist","computing","computing","programming_language","file_systems","programming_language","computer_programming","arts","computing","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Harman/scam10.pdf","http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~emmerik/experience_long.pdf"],"categories":["Source code|*"],"headings":["Definitions","Organization","Purposes","Licensing","Legal issues in the United States","Quality","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/CodeCmmt002.svg/300px-CodeCmmt002.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["comment","computer_programming"],["execution","computing"],["interpreter","computing"],["user","computing"],["mark_harman","computer_scientist"],["directory","file_systems"],["c","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["macro","computer_science"],["interpreter","computing"],["media","arts"]],"members":["mark_harman","interpreter","execution","java","directory","c","comment","media","user","macro"],"related":["Computer_science","Computer_program","Comment_(computer_programming)","Human-readable","Computer_language","Plain_text","Programmer","Compiler","Machine_code","Execution_(computing)","Interpreter_(computing)","On_the_fly","Computer_application","Executable_file","User_(computing)","System_administrator","Machine-readable_data","Code_snippets","Pretty_Good_Privacy","Mark_Harman_(computer_scientist)","Computer_program","Text_file","Hard_disk","Directory_(file_systems)","Stored_procedure","C_(programming_language)","Assembly_language","Library_linking","Java_(programming_language)","Macro_(computer_science)","GNU_Emacs","Programming","Computer_program","Version_control_system","Makefile","Revision_control","Compiler","Interpreter_(computing)","Algorithm","Code_snippets","Programmer","Media_(arts)","Porting","Computer_platform","Binary_translation","Decompilation","Assembly_code","High_level_language","Software_reusability","Free_software","Proprietary_software","GNU_General_Public_License","GNU_operating_system","Linux_kernel","Trade_secret","Patent","Retail_software","Software_license_agreement","Decompilation","Reverse_engineering","Copy_protection","Compiler","Object_code","Code_obfuscation","Code_morphing","Free_speech","University_of_California","Mathematics","Dan_Bernstein","Encryption","Munition","National_security","United_States_Department_of_State","Electronic_Frontier_Foundation","Federal_government_of_the_United_States","Coding_conventions","Readability","Coding_conventions","Legacy_code","Machine_code","Bytecode","Obfuscated_code","Object_code","Open-source_software","Programming_language","Source_code_repository","Syntax_highlighting","Undefined_variable","Delft","Netherlands","Linux"]}
