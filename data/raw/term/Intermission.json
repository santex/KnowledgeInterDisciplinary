{"cursor":"11225","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nAn 'intermission' (American English) or 'interval' (British English) is a recess\nbetween parts of a performance or production, such as for a theatrical play,\nopera, concert, or film screening. It should not be confused with an entr'acte\n(French: \"between acts\"), which, in the 18th century, was a sung, danced,\nspoken, or musical performance that occurs between any two acts, that is\nunrelated to the main performance, and that thus in the world of opera and\nmusical theatre became an orchestral performance that spans an intermission and\nleads, without a break, into the next act.\n\nMarmontel and Diderot both viewed the interval as a period in which the action\ndid not in fact stop, but continued off-stage. \"The interval is a rest for the\nspectators; not for the action.\", wrote Marmontel in 1763. \"The characters are\ndeemed to continue acting during the interval from one act to another.\" However,\nintervals are more than just dramatic pauses that are parts of the shape of a\ndramatic structure. They also exist for more mundane reasons, such as that it is\nhard for audience members to concentrate for more than two hours at a stretch,\nand actors and performers (for live action performances at any rate) need to\nrest. They afford opportunity for scene and costume changes. And of course\nperformance venues take advantage of them to sell food and drink.\n\nPsychologically, intervals cause audiences to return to reality, and are a\nperiod during which they can engage critical faculties that they have suspended\nduring the performance itself.\n","linknr":228,"url":"Intermission","recorded":1362900846,"links":16,"instances":["director","theatrical","broadway","theatre","film","movie_theater"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stage terminology"],"headings":["Plays","Films","Bollywood","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["play","theatre"],["peter_hall","director"],["lyceum_theatre","broadway"],["snipe","theatrical"],["multiplex","movie_theater"],["dhobi_ghat","film"]],"members":["peter_hall","snipe","lyceum_theatre","play","dhobi_ghat","multiplex"],"related":["Performance","Play_(theatre)","Opera","Concert","Film_screening","Entr'acte","Musical_theatre","Jean-Fran√ßois_Marmontel","Denis_Diderot","Broadway_theatre","William_Shakespeare","Trevor_Nunn","Stephen_Pimlott","Tobias_Hoheisel","Peter_Hall_(director)","Kabuki","Sarah_Bernhardt","Lyceum_Theatre_(Broadway)","Concession_stand","Snipe_(theatrical)","Drive-in_theater","Let's_All_Go_to_the_Lobby","Digital_projection","Multiplex_(movie_theater)","Bollywood","Dhobi_Ghat_(film)","Hollywood","United_Kingdom","Veer-Zaara"]}
