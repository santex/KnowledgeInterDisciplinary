The convention for writing\npeptide sequences is to put the N-terminus on the left and write the sequence\nfrom N- to C-terminus. When the protein is translated from messenger RNA, it is\ncreated from N-terminus to C-terminus.\n","linknr":-1,"url":"N-terminus","recorded":1362478808,"links":0,"instances":["biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Posttranslational modification","Proteins","Protein structure"],"headings":["Chemistry","Function","See also","References"],"image":[],"tags":[["translation","biology"]],"members":["translation"],"related":["Glycine","Serine","Alanine","Valine","Alanine","Valine","Glycine","Serine","Alanine","Protein","Polypeptide","Amino_acid","Amine","C-terminus","C-terminus","Carboxyl_group","Dehydration_reaction","C-terminus","Translation_(biology)","Messenger_RNA","Transfer_RNA","Start_codon","Genetic_code","Methionine","N-Formylmethionine","Posttranslational_modification","Protein_precursor","Ribosome","Protein_biosynthesis","Signal_peptide","Postal_code","Organelle","Peptidase","N-end_rule","Signal_recognition_particle","Secretory_pathway","Eukaryote","Endoplasmic_reticulum","Prokaryote","Cell_membrane","Chloroplast","Thylakoid","Mitochondrion","Chloroplast","Transmembrane_domain","C-terminus","Myristoyl_group","Fatty_acid","Palmitoyl","TopFIND"]}
