{"cursor":"7425","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Endogamy' is the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group, class, or\nsocial group, rejecting others on such basis as being unsuitable for marriage or\nother close personal relationships.\n\nEndogamy is common in many cultures and ethnic groups. Several ethnic religious\ngroups are traditionally more endogamous, although sometimes with the added\ndimension of requiring marital religious conversion. This permits an exogamous\nmarriage, as the convert, by accepting the partner's religion, becomes accepted\nwithin the endogamous rules. Certain groups, such as Orthodox Jews, have\npracticed endogamy as an inherent part of their religious beliefs and\ntraditions. In the past Roman Catholics traditionally practiced religious\nendogamy as well.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Endogamy","recorded":1362373610,"links":46,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.sneps.net/RD/uploads/1-The%20Demography%20of%20Islam%20in%20Europe.pdf","http://eclectic.ss.uci.edu/~drwhite/T&S/BrudnerWhite1997Convert.pdf"],"categories":["Population genetics","Caste","Kinship and descent","Types of marriage"],"headings":["Adherence","Population genetics","Social dynamics","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Marriage","Ethnic_group","Social_class","Social_group","Marital_conversion","Exogamous","Orthodox_Judaism","Jews","Roman_Catholics","Affiliation","Diaspora","Auto-segregation","Romani_people","Ashkenazi","Arab_Christians","Middle_East","Assyrian_people","Jews","Yazidi","Iraqi_Kurdistan","Mandaeans","Iraq","Turkmen_people","Armenian_Iranians","Old_Order_Amish","Mennonites","Jehovah's_Witnesses","Memons","Muslims","Knanaya_Christians","Hindus","Parsi_people","India","Hindu","Caste_system_in_India","Purusha_Sukta","Isolationist","Samaritan","Social_stratification","Marriage","Human_bonding","Social_Class","Social_mobility","Elite","Urapmin","Cognatic","Consanguinity","Inbreeding","Ethnic_nepotism","Arranged_marriage","Auto-segregation","Cousin_marriage","List_of_coupled_cousins","Homogamy","Exogamy","Hypergamy"]}
