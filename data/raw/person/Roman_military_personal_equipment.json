These standard\npatterns and uses were called the res militaris or disciplina. Its regular\npractice during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire led to military excellence\nand victory. The general word for army became exercitus, \"exercise.\" Roman\nequipment (especially armor) gave them \"a distinct advantage over their\nbarbarian enemies.\" Elton, Hugh, 1996, Warfare in Roman Europe, AD 350-425,\np. 110 This did not imply that every Roman soldier had better equipment\nthan the richer men among his opponents. According to Edward Luttwak, Roman\nequipment was not of a better quality than that used by the majority of its\nadversaries. In Luttwak, E., The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire, JHUP,\n1979, Luttwak states that \"Roman weapons, far from being universally more\nadvanced, were frequently inferior to those used by... enemies\"\n\nInitially, they used weapons based on Greek and Etruscan types. On encountering\nthe Celts, they based new varieties on Celtic equipment. To defeat the\nCarthaginians, they constructed an entire fleet de novo based on the\nCarthaginian model. Once a weapon was adopted, it became standard. The standard\nweapons varied somewhat during Rome's long history, but the equipment and its\nuse were never individual.\n","linknr":599,"url":"Roman_military_personal_equipment","recorded":1362538265,"links":29,"instances":["stake","sword_belt","carrying_pole","satchel","shoe","roman_army","weapon","armour"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Ancient Roman military equipment"],"headings":["Overview of infantry","Personal weapons","Torso armour","Limb armour","Shields","Helmets","Clothing","Sarcina","Other","See also","External links","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Roman_legion_at_attack.jpg/220px-Roman_legion_at_attack.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Pugio_175_aC.jpg/150px-Pugio_175_aC.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Gladius_2.jpg/150px-Gladius_2.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/AdamclisiMetope9.jpg/220px-AdamclisiMetope9.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Roman_soldier_in_lorica_segmentata_1.jpg/220px-Roman_soldier_in_lorica_segmentata_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Roman_chainmail_detail.jpg/150px-Roman_chainmail_detail.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Roman_scale_armour_fragment.JPG/220px-Roman_scale_armour_fragment.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Roman_scale_armour_detail.JPG/220px-Roman_scale_armour_detail.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Roman_parade_helmet%2C_2nd_century.jpg/220px-Roman_parade_helmet%2C_2nd_century.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Sarcina_detail_002.jpg/220px-Sarcina_detail_002.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/AdamclisiMetope26.jpg/220px-AdamclisiMetope26.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/AdamclisiMetope39.jpg/220px-AdamclisiMetope39.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Caltrope_%28PSF%29.jpg/220px-Caltrope_%28PSF%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["javelin","weapon"],["mail","armour"],["mail","armour"],["mail","armour"],["centurion","roman_army"],["balteus","sword_belt"],["cleat","shoe"],["furca","carrying_pole"],["loculus","satchel"],["sudis","stake"]],"members":["sudis","balteus","furca","loculus","cleat","centurion","javelin","mail"],"related":["Roman_Republic","Roman_Empire","Edward_Luttwak","Celts","Ancient_Carthage","Vegetius","Rome","Constantinople","Greave","Dagger","Ancient_Rome","Gladius","Roman_Republic","Sword","Ancient_Rome","Legionary","Historical_reenactment","Mainz","Latin","Spear","Hastati","Roman_Republic","Pilum","Gladius","Triarii","Velites","Javelin_(weapon)","Iron","Roman_Empire","Enemy","Composite_bow","Vegetius","Late_Roman_army","Mail_(armour)","Muscle_cuirass","Body_armour","Roman_Empire","Latin","Leather","Roman_Legion","Praetorians","Lorica_hamata","Mail_(armour)","Lorica_squamata","Scale_armour","Mail_(armour)","Roman_Republic","Roman_Empire","Celts","Scale_armour","Centurion_(Roman_army)","Cavalry","Legionary","Lorica_hamata","Iron","Bronze","Iron","Montefortino_helmet","Coolus_helmet","Tunic","Focale","Balteus_(sword_belt)","Braccae","Vindolanda_tablets","Poncho","Sagum","Paenula","Fibulae","Caligae","Cleat_(shoe)","Pteruges","Furca_(carrying_pole)","Loculus_(satchel)","Water_skin","Marian_reforms","Sarcina","Patera","Shovel","Dolabra","Wicker_basket","Sudis_(stake)","Caltrop","Weapon","Tetrahedron","Horse","War_elephant","Camel","Ancient_Rome","Vegetius","Military_of_ancient_Rome","Technological_history_of_the_Roman_military","Ammianus_Marcellinus"]}
