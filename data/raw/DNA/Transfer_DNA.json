{"cursor":"3415","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nThe 'transfer DNA' (abbreviated T-DNA) is the transferred DNA of the tumor-\ninducing (Ti) plasmid of some species of bacteria such as [[Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens]] and [[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]]. It derives its name from the\nfact that the bacterium transfers this DNA fragment into the host plant's\nnuclear DNA genome. The T-DNA is bordered by 25-base-pair repeats on each end.\nTransfer is initiated at the right border and terminated at the left border and\nrequires the vir genes of the Ti plasmid.\n\nThe bacterial T-DNA is about 20,000 base pairs long and contains genes that code\nfor enzymes synthesizing opines and phytohormones. By transferring the T-DNA\ninto the plant genome, the bacterium essentially reprograms the plant cells to\ngrow into a tumor and produce a unique food source for the bacteria. The\nsynthesis of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin enables the plant cell to\ngrow uncontrollably, thus forming the crown gall tumors typically induced by\nAgrobacterium infection. The opines are amino acid derivatives used by the\nbacterium as a source of carbon and energy.\n","linknr":113,"url":"Transfer_DNA","recorded":1362477115,"links":17,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Biotechnology","Plant pathogens and diseases","Mobile genetic elements"],"headings":["T-DNA transformation","Mechanism of T-DNA  Transformation","T-DNA mutagenesis","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ti_plasmid.svg/350px-Ti_plasmid.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Deoxyribonucleic_acid","Ti_plasmid","Cell_nucleus","Genome","Gene","Enzyme","Opines","Phytohormone","Auxin","Cytokinin","Crown_gall_tumor","Opines","Amino_acid","Biotechnology","Genetic_engineering","Neomycin_phosphotransferase","Hygromycin_B_phosphotransferase","Phosphinothricin_acetyltransferase","Phosphinothricin","Glutamine_synthetase","Transgenic_plant","Insertional_mutagenesis"]}
