Scientists use DNA\nmicroarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes\nsimultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot\ncontains picomoles (10 â12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as\n[[Hybridization probe|probe]]s (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short\nsection of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA\n(also called anti-sense RNA)  sample (called target) under high-\nstringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and\nquantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled\ntargets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target.\n","linknr":688,"url":"DNA_microarray","recorded":1362481362,"links":49,"instances":["natural_sciences","company","statistics","biochemistry","company","genetics","unit","molecular_biology","methylase","statistics"],"pdf":["http://www.vmrf.org/research-websites/gcf/Forms/Churchill.pdf","http://www.vmrf.org/research-websites/gcf/Forms/Churchill.pdf","http://www.maxlittle.net/publications/pwc_filtering_arxiv.pdf","http://www.maxlittle.net/publications/pwc_filtering_arxiv.pdf"],"categories":["Gene
