{"cursor":"20754","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Recombinant DNA' ('rDNA') molecules are DNA sequences that result from the use\nof laboratory methods (molecular cloning) to bring together genetic material\nfrom multiple sources, creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in\nbiological organisms. Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA molecules from all\norganisms share the same chemical structure; they differ only in the sequence of\nnucleotides within that identical overall structure. Consequently, when DNA from\na foreign source is linked to host sequences that can drive DNA replication and\nthen introduced into a host organism, the foreign DNA is replicated along with\nthe host DNA.\n","linknr":463,"url":"Recombinant_DNA","recorded":1362507637,"links":50,"instances":["biotechnology","genetics","mythology","genetics","genetics","biology","biology","molecular_biology"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20100923031225/http://www.unh.edu/ehs/pdf/Recombinant-DNA.pdf"],"categories":["Biotechnology","Molecular genetics","Molecular biology"],"headings":["Introduction","Creating recombinant DNA","Expression of recombinant DNA","Properties of organisms containing recombinant DNA","Applications of recombinant DNA technology","History of recombinant DNA","Controversy","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Recombinant_formation_of_plasmids.svg/280px-Recombinant_formation_of_plasmids.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chimera","mythology"],["vector","molecular_biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","biology"],["translation","biology"],["promoter","biology"],["terminator","genetics"],["protein_expression","biotechnology"],["insertion","genetics"]],"members":["protein_expression","transcription","chimera","terminator","insertion","promoter","translation","vector"],"related":["DNA","Molecular_cloning","DNA_sequence","Nucleotides","DNA_replication","Chimera_(mythology)","Sticky_and_blunt_ends","Species","Oligonucleotide_synthesis","Expression_vector","Genetic_recombination","Polymerase_chain_reaction","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Plasmid","Virus","Gibson_assembly","Molecular_cloning","Gene_expression","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(biology)","MRNA","Translation_(biology)","Promoter_(biology)","Shine-Dalgarno_sequence","Terminator_(genetics)","Phenotype","RT-PCR","Western_blot","Protein_expression_(biotechnology)","Insertion_(genetics)","Gene_knockout","Biotechnology","Medicine","Research","Humulin","GloFish","Chymosin","Rennet","Insulin","Diabetes","Growth_hormone","Creutzfeldt-Jacob_disease","Factor_VIII","Blood-borne_disease","Hepatitis_B_vaccine","Hepatitis_B","Polio_virus","In_vitro","HIV","HIV_test","ELISA","Western_blot","Antibodies","RT-PCR","Golden_rice","Î’-carotene","Vitamin_A_deficiency","Glyphosate","Glyphosate","Bacillus_thuringiensis","Bt_toxin","Transgenic","Stanford_University","Stanley_N._Cohen","Herbert_W._Boyer","Genentech","Eli_Lilly_and_Company","Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA","Genetically_modified_organism","Genetically_modified_food_controversies","Asilomar_conference_on_recombinant_DNA","Genetic_engineering","Genetically_modified_organism","Recombinant_virus","Vector_DNA","Biomolecular_engineering"]}
