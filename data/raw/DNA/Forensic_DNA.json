'DNA profiles'\nare encrypted sets of numbers that reflect a person's DNA makeup, which can also\nbe used as the person's identifier. DNA profiling should not be confused with\nfull genome sequencing. Kijk magazine, 1 January 2009 It is used in,\nfor example, parental testing and criminal investigation.\n\nAlthough 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough\nof the DNA is different to distinguish one individual from another, unless\nthey are monozygotic twins. DNA profiling uses\nrepetitive (\"repeat\") sequences that are highly variable, called variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), particularly\nshort tandem repeats (STRs). VNTR loci are very similar between closely\nrelated humans, but so variable that unrelated individuals are extremely\nunlikely to have the same VNTRs.\n\nThe DNA profiling technique was first reported in 1984 Joseph Wambaugh, The\nBlooding (New York: A Perigord Press Book, 1989), 83. by Sir Alec Jeffreys\nat the University of Leicester in England, Jeffreys A.J., Wilson V., Thein\nS.W. (1984). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v314/n6006/abs/314067a0.html\n\"Hypervariable 'minisatellite' regions in human DNA\"]. Nature 314: 67â73.\n. and is now the basis of several national DNA databases. Dr. Jeffreys's\ngenetic fingerprinting was made commercially available in 1987, when a chemical\ncompany, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), started a blood-testing centre in\nEngland.
