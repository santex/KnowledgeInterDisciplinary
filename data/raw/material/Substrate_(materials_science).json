{"cursor":"6303","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{Multiple issues|\n\n\n\n}}\n\nA 'coating' is a covering that is applied to the surface of an object, usually\nreferred to as the 'substrate'. In many cases coatings are applied to improve\nsurface properties of the substrate, such as appearance, adhesion, wetability,\ncorrosion resistance, wear resistance, and scratch resistance. Some new coatings\nformulated using nanotechnology promise to create long-term surface\nprotection. In other cases, in particular in printing processes and\nsemiconductor device fabrication (where the substrate is a wafer), the coating\nforms an essential part of the finished product.\n\nCoating and printing processes involve the application of a thin film of\nfunctional material to a substrate, such as paper, fabric, film, foil, or sheet\nstock. This article discusses what is frequently termed \"roll-to-roll\" or \"web-\nbased\" coating. A roll of substrate, when wound through the coating machine, is\ntypically called a 'web'.\n\nCoatings may be applied as liquids, gases or solids. Coatings can be measured\nand tested for proper opacity and film thickness by using a drawdown card.\n","linknr":236,"url":"Substrate_(materials_science)","recorded":1362477044,"links":29,"instances":["mechanical","physics","deposition","chemistry","coating","metal","electronics","printing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Coatings|","Corrosion","Materials science","Printing"],"headings":["Functions","Coating processes","Standards","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["wafer","electronics"],["evaporation","deposition"],["phosphate","coating"],["pickling","metal"],["hydrographics","printing"],["curing","chemistry"],["deposition","physics"],["seal","mechanical"]],"members":["seal","deposition","evaporation","curing","phosphate","pickling","wafer","hydrographics"],"related":["Corrosion_resistance","Semiconductor_device_fabrication","Wafer_(electronics)","Thin_film","Fabric","Roll-to-roll_processing","Liquid","Gas","Solid","Drawdown_card","Printing","Converting","Self_adhesive","Photo-sensitivity","Water-resistant","Scratch_and_sniff","Metalorganic_vapour_phase_epitaxy","Electrostatic_spray_assisted_vapour_deposition","Cathodic_arc_deposition","Electron_beam_physical_vapor_deposition","Ion_plating","Ion_beam_assisted_deposition","Magnetron_sputtering","Pulsed_laser_deposition","Sputter_deposition","Vacuum_deposition","Vacuum_evaporation","Evaporation_(deposition)","Anodising","Conversion_coating","Anodizing","Chromate_conversion_coating","Plasma_electrolytic_oxidation","Phosphate_(coating)","Ion_beam_mixing","Pickling_(metal)","Steel","Plating","Electroless_plating","Electroplating","Sol-gel","High_velocity_oxygen_fuel","Plasma_spraying","Thermal_spray","Plasma_transferred_wire_arc_thermal_spraying","Antireflection_coating","Mirror","Dip-coating","Epitaxy","Vitreous_enamel","Paint","Enamel_paint","Silicate_mineral_paint","Polymer","Teflon","Powder_coating","Powder_slurry_coating","Fusion_bonded_epoxy_coating","Molecular_beam_epitaxy","Sheradizing","Spin_coating","Coated_paper","Industrial_coating","Roll-to-roll","Air_knife","Anilox","Curtain_Coating","Flexo","Gravure","Hydrographics_(printing)","Rotary_screen","Screen-printing","Extrusion","Varnishes","UV_Coating","Curing_(chemistry)","ISO_1461","ISO_4042","ISO_10683","ISO_10684","ISO_12944","Adhesion_Tester","Deposition_(physics)","Formulations","Optically_active_additive","Plastic_film","Printed_electronics","Seal_(mechanical)","Thermal_barrier_coating","Thin-film_deposition"]}
