{"cursor":"32144","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n pipes]] ]]\n\nA 'pipe' is a tubular section or hollow cylinder, usually but not necessarily of\ncircular cross-section, used mainly to convey substances which can\nflow — liquids and gases (fluids), slurries, powders, masses of small\nsolids. It can also be used for structural applications; hollow pipe is far\nstiffer per unit weight than solid members.\n\nIn common usage the words pipe and [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]] are usually\ninterchangeable, but in industry and engineering, the terms are uniquely\ndefined. Depending on the applicable standard to which it is manufactured, pipe\nis generally specified by a nominal diameter with a constant outside diameter\n(OD) and a schedule that defines the thickness. Tube is most often specified by\nthe OD and wall thickness, but may be specified by any two of OD, inside\ndiameter (ID), and wall thickness. Pipe is generally manufactured to one of\nseveral international and national industrial standards. [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/iso-pipes-tubes-fiitings-\nstandards-d_767.html ISO - Pipe, Tube and Fittings Standards and\nSpecifications] While similar standards exist for specific industry\napplication tubing, tube is often made to custom sizes and a broader range of\ndiameters and tolerances. Many industrial and government standards exist for the\nproduction of pipe and tubing. The term \"tube\" is also commonly applied to non-\ncylindrical sections, i.e., square or rectangular tubing. In general, \"pipe\" is\nthe more common term in most of the world, whereas \"tube\" is more widely used in\nthe United States.\n\nBoth \"pipe\" and \"tube\" imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a\n[[Hose (tubing)|hose]] (or hosepipe) is usually portable and flexible. Pipe\nassemblies are almost always constructed with the use of fittings such as\nelbows, tees, and so on, while tube may be formed or bent into custom\nconfigurations. For materials that are inflexible, cannot be formed, or where\nconstruction is governed by codes or standards, tube assemblies are also\nconstructed with the use of tube fittings.\n","linknr":370,"url":"Pipe_(material)","recorded":1362511469,"links":50,"instances":["geometry","machine","geometry","joining","bpvc","plumbing","device"],"pdf":["http://www.hultec.co.za/downloads/buried_lifelines.pdf","http://www.hultec.co.za/downloads/buried_lifelines.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080227154611/http://www.zeusinc.com/pdf/Zeus_Critical_Fluid_Handling.pdf"],"categories":["Irrigation","Piping","Plumbing"],"headings":["Uses","Manufacture","Materials","Sizes","Standards","Installation","Cleaning","Other
