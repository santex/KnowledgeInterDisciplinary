{"cursor":"34812","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Composite materials' (also called 'composition materials' or shortened to\n'composites') are materials made from two or more constituent materials with\nsignificantly different physical or chemical properties, that when combined,\nproduce a material with characteristics different from the individual\ncomponents. The individual components remain separate and distinct within the\nfinished structure.\n\nTypical engineered composite materials include:\n* Composite building materials such as cements, concrete\n* Reinforced plastics such as fiber-reinforced polymer\n* Metal Composites\n* Ceramic Composites (composite ceramic and metal matrices)\n\nComposite materials are generally used for buildings, bridges and structures\nsuch as boat hulls, race car bodies, shower stalls, bathtubs, and storage tanks,\nimitation granite and cultured marble sinks and countertops. The most advanced\nexamples perform routinely on spacecraft in demanding environments.\n","linknr":441,"url":"Composite_material","recorded":1362552016,"links":67,"instances":["fiber","industrial","pump","plastic","biology","process","aircraft","chemistry","plant","unit","fiber"],"pdf":["http://www.ncsu.edu/bioresources/BioRes_02/BioRes_02_4_534_535_Hubbe_L_BioResJ_Editorial_LoveHate.pdf","http://ammtiac.alionscience.com/pdf/AQV2N4.pdf","http://ammtiac.alionscience.com/pdf/AQV2N4.pdf","http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t9/SIA_9_Composites.pdf","http://www.nenastran.com/newnoran/chPDF/CASE_Chassis_Design.pdf"],"categories":["Composite
