Museum of Toyota of Aichi Prefecture, Japan.]] ian filling\nstation with four alternative fuels for sale: biodiesel (B3), gasohol (E25),\nneat ethanol (E100), and compressed natural gas (CNG). Piracicaba, Brazil.]] An\n'alternative fuel vehicle' is a vehicle that runs on a fuel other than\n\"traditional\" petroleum fuels (petrol or diesel); and also refers to any\ntechnology of powering an engine that does not involve solely petroleum (e.g.\nelectric car, hybrid electric vehicles, solar powered). Because of a combination\nof factors, such as environmental concerns, high oil prices and the potential\nfor peak oil, development of cleaner alternative fuels and advanced power\nsystems for vehicles has become a high priority for many governments and vehicle\nmanufacturers around the world.\n\nHybrid electric vehicles such as the Toyota Prius are not actually alternative\nfuel vehicles, but through advanced technologies in the electric battery and\nmotor/generator, they make a more efficient use of petroleum fuel.\nOther research and development efforts in alternative forms of power focus on\ndeveloping all-electric and fuel cell vehicles, and even the stored energy of\ncompressed air.\n\nAs of 2011 there were more than one billion vehicles in use in the\nworld, compared with around 70 million alternative fuel\nand advanced technology vehicles that had been sold or converted worldwide as of\nDecember 2011, and made up mainly of: *27.1 million flexible-fuel vehicles\nthrough December 2011, led by Brazil with 16.3 million,\npp. 62-63. Carta de ANFAVEA 308 pp. 4.\nfollowed by the United States with almost 10 million, Canada\n(600,000), As of 2008 and Europe, led by Sweden\n(228,522). As of December 2011, see Graph \"Bought flexifuel\nvehicles\" The Brazilian fleet includes 1.5 million flexible-fuel\nmotorcycles sold since 2009.\n*17.5 million LPG powered vehicles by December 2010, led by Turkey with 2.39\nmillion, Poland (2.32 million), and South Korea (2.3 million).\n*14.8 million natural gas vehicles by December 2011, led by Iran with 2.86\nmillion, followed by Pakistan (2.85 million), Argentina (2.04 million), Brazil\n(1.7 million), and India (1.1 million). *5.7 million\nneat-ethanol only light-vehicles built in Brazil since 1979, with 2.4 to 3.0 million vehicles still in use by\n2003. and 1.22 million units as of December\n2011. *More than 5.2 million hybrid electric\nvehicles have been sold worldwide by the end of September 2012, led by Toyota\nMotor Company (TMC) with more than 4 million Lexus and Toyota hybrids sold by\nApril 2012, followed by Honda Motor Co., Ltd. with\ncumulative global sales of more than 1 million hybrids by September 2012, and Ford Motor Corporation with more than 200 thousand\nhybrids sold in the United States by June 2012. The\nworld's best selling hybrid is the Toyota Prius, with 2.8 million units sold by\nOctober 2012. Sales are led by the United States\nalmost 2.5 million units sold through September 2012, Total\nregistered electric hybrids in the U.S. is 1,888,971 vehicles until December\n2010.

Most electric vehicles in the\nworld roads are low-speed, low-range neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs), with\nabout 479,000 NEVs on the road by 2011. The world's top\nselling NEV is the GEM, with global sales of 45,000 units through December\n2010. The world's best selling highway-capable plug-in\nelectric car is the Nissan Leaf all-electric car, with more than 21,000 units\nsold worldwide through December 2011, followed by the\nMitsubishi i-MiEV electric car, with global cumulative sales of more than 17,000\nunits through October 2011, and the Chevrolet Volt\nplug-in hybrid, with 8,272 units sold through December 2011 in the U.S. and\nCanada. The United States and\nJapan are the world's largest highway-capable plug-in electric car markets as of\nDecember 2011. Since December 2010, around 18,000 plug-in electric cars have\nbeen sold in the U.S. through December 2011, led by the Nissan Leaf (9,693\nunits) and the Chevrolet Volt (7,997 units).\nSince July 2009, more than 13,000 electric cars have been sold in Japan by\nNovember 2011, which includes more than 8,000 Leafs and\n5,000 i-MiEVs.\n\nAn environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and\nemissions. A life-cycle assessment of a vehicle involves production and post-use\nconsiderations. A cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a\nsingle factor such as the type of fuel. {{Citation\n| url = http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/OWCM.NSF/product+stewardship/autos-\n| strategies
