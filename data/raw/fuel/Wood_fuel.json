{"cursor":"29357","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'Wood fuel' is wood used as fuel. Wood fuel may be available as firewood,\ncharcoal, chips, sheets, pellets, and sawdust. The particular form used depends\nupon factors such as source, quantity, quality and application. In many areas,\nwood is the most easily available form of fuel, requiring no tools in the case\nof picking up dead wood, or little tools, although as in any industry,\nspecialized tools, such as skidders and hydraulic wood splitters, have been\ndeveloped to mechanize production. Sawmill waste and construction industry by-\nproducts also include various forms of lumber tailings.\n\nThe discovery of how to make fire for the purpose of burning wood is regarded\nas one of humanity's most important advances. The use of wood as a fuel source\nfor heating is much older than civilization and was used by Neanderthals.\nToday, burning of wood is the largest use of energy derived from a solid fuel\nbiomass. Wood fuel can be used for cooking and heating, and occasionally for\nfueling steam engines and steam turbines that generate electricity. Wood may\nbe used indoors in a furnace, stove, or fireplace, or outdoors in a campfire,\nor bonfire.\n\nSome consider wood fuel bad for the environment, however this is not the case if\nproper techniques are used. One might increase carbon emissions using\ngas powered saws and splitters in the production of firewood, but when wood heat\nreplaces carbon-producing fuels such as propane, heating oil or electricity from\na coal-burning plant, then wood burning has a positive impact on the carbon\nfootprint.\n","linknr":656,"url":"Wood_fuel","recorded":1362500126,"links":45,"instances":["vehicle","wood","unit","australia","ecology","victoria","unit_of_volume"],"pdf":["http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1993/misra93a.pdf","http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1993/misra93a.pdf","http://www.manomet.org/sites/manomet.org/files/Manomet_Biomass_Report_Full_LoRez.pdf","http://cahe.nmsu.edu/pubs/_g/g-102.pdf"],"categories":["Wood
