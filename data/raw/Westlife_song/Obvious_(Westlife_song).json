The song peaked at number\nthree on the UK Singles Chart, but marked the departure of Brian McFadden from\nthe band. The band originally planned to write a farewell song for Brian, as it\nwas his choice to leave, however, due to tour rehearsals and TV appearances, it\nwas decided 'Obvious' would be released as a single instead. However, as a\ntribute, CD2 features a medley of Brian's favourite Westlife songs.\n","linknr":245,"url":"Obvious_(Westlife_song)","recorded":1362674972,"links":27,"instances":["westlife_album","band","singer","westlife_version"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Westlife songs","Songs written by Andreas Carlsson","Songs written by Savan Kotecha","2004 singles","Pop ballads"],"headings":["Tours performed at","Track listing","Chart performance","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/61/ObviousCD1.jpg/220px-ObviousCD1.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/ObviousCD2.jpg/220px-ObviousCD2.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["turnaround","westlife_album"],["pilot","band"],["mandy","westlife_version"],["brian_mcfadden","singer"]],"members":["turnaround","pilot","brian_mcfadden","mandy"],"related":["Westlife","Turnaround_(Westlife_album)","Olympic_Studios","London","The_Location","Stockholm","Sweden","Quiz_&_Larossi","Stockholm","Sweden","Pop-Rock","BMG","Andreas_Carlsson","Pilot_(band)","Savan_Kotecha","Mandy_(Westlife_Version)","Westlife","UK_Singles_Chart","Brian_McFadden_(singer)","Austrian_Singles_Chart","Denmark","Netherlands","Europe","Germany","German_Singles_Chart","Irish_Singles_Chart","Sweden","Swiss","UK_Singles_Chart"]}
