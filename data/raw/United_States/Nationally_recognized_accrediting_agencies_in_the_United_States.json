{"cursor":"20180","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Higher education accreditation in the United States' is a peer review process\ncoordinated by accreditation commissions and member institutions. It was first\nundertaken in the late 19th century by cooperating educational institutions. The\nfederal government began to play a limited role in Higher education\naccreditation in 1952 with reauthorization of the GI Bill for Korean War\nveterans. The original GI Bill legislation had stimulated establishment of new\ncolleges and universities to accommodate the influx of new students; but some of\nthese new institutions were of dubious quality. The 1952 legislation designated\nthe existing peer review process as the basis for measuring institutional\nquality; GI Bill eligibility was limited to students enrolled at accredited\ninstitutions included on a list of federally recognized accredited institutions\npublished by the U.S. Commissioner of Education.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education\nAccreditation (CHEA) (a non-governmental organization) both recognize reputable\naccrediting bodies for institutions of higher education and provide guidelines\nas well as resources and relevant data regarding these accreditors. Neither the\nU.S. Department of Education nor CHEA accredit individual institutions. U.S.\nDepartment of Education, [http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/index.html\nAccreditation in the United States]\n\nWith the creation of the U.S. Department of Education and under the terms of the\nHigher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is\nrequired by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies\nthat the Secretary has determined to be reliable authorities on the quality of\neducation or training provided by the institutions of higher education and the\nhigher education programs they accredit. College Review Journal, [http://www.collegereviewjournal.org/complete-list-of-national-accrediting-\nagencies Complete List of National Accrediting Agencies]. There are\nregional and national accrediting agencies, both of which are accountable to the\nDepartment of Education. Regional bodies have more oversight and accredit\ninstitutions in a particular region of the country. National bodies have less\noversight in their policy and commonly accredit institutions across the country,\nand sometimes beyond it. Within American higher education, the former are\nconsidered more reputable.\n","linknr":286,"url":"Nationally_recognized_accrediting_agencies_in_the_United_States","recorded":1371244956,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","/wiki/Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.rtlcite%2Cwikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","/w/index.php?title=Nationally_recognized_accrediting_agencies_in_the_United_States&redirect=no","#mw-navigation","#p-search","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit","/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1","/wiki/Template:Citation_needed","/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Burden_of_evidence","/wiki/Peer_review","/wiki/Higher_education_accreditation","/wiki/GI_Bill","/wiki/Korean_War","/wiki/Military_veteran","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Council_for_Higher_Education_Accreditation","/wiki/Non-governmental_organization","/wiki/Higher_education","#cite_note-2","/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965","/wiki/U.S._Secretary_of_Education","#cite_note-3","/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education","#cite_note-Aasen-4","#Regional_accreditation","#National_accreditors","#National_accreditation_compared_to_regional_accreditation","#Specialized_and_professional_accreditors","#Other_recognized_accreditors","#Religious_accreditors","#Use_of_.edu_top-level_Internet_domain","#Assessments_of_accreditation","#See_also","#References","#Further_reading","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1","/wiki/Regional_accreditation","#cite_note-Altbach-5","#cite_note-NChistory-6","/wiki/Regional_accreditation","#cite_note-Altbach-5","#cite_note-NChistory-6","#cite_note-NChistory-6","#cite_note-DOE-7","/wiki/Non-profit","#cite_note-tussle-8","#cite_note-9","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2","/wiki/List_of_recognized_higher_education_accreditation_organizations#United_States","#cite_note-accredsearch-10","#cite_note-11","/wiki/Distance_Education_and_Training_Council","/wiki/Accrediting_Council_for_Independent_Colleges_and_Schools","/wiki/Accrediting_Commission_of_Career_Schools_and_Colleges_of_Technology","/w/index.php?title=Accrediting_Council_for_Continuing_Education_and_Training&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/Council_on_Occupational_Education","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3","#cite_note-12","#cite_note-Aasen-4","#cite_note-demand-13","#cite_note-tussle-8","#cite_note-sea-14","#cite_note-15","#cite_note-wj-16","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4","#cite_note-17","/wiki/Accreditation_Board_for_Engineering_and_Technology","/wiki/American_Bar_Association","/wiki/Law_school","/wiki/Bar_exam","/wiki/American_Dental_Association","/wiki/Dentistry_school","/wiki/American_Veterinary_Medical_Association","/wiki/Veterinary_school","/wiki/Association_of_American_Medical_Colleges","/wiki/Medical_school","/wiki/Association_to_Advance_Collegiate_Schools_of_Business","/wiki/Business_school","/wiki/National_Architectural_Accrediting_Board","/wiki/Architecture_school","/wiki/National_Association_of_Schools_of_Public_Affairs_and_Administration","/wiki/Public_policy_school","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5","/wiki/State_Bar_of_California#Lawyer_admissions","#cite_note-18","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6","/wiki/Association_of_Advanced_Rabbinical_and_Talmudic_Schools","/wiki/Association_of_Theological_Schools_in_the_United_States_and_Canada","/wiki/Association_for_Biblical_Higher_Education","/wiki/Transnational_Association_of_Christian_Colleges_and_Schools","/wiki/Seminaries","/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed","/wiki/Puerto_Rico","#cite_note-19","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=7","/wiki/.edu","/wiki/Top-Level_Domain","/wiki/.edu","#cite_note-20","/w/index.php?title=Higher_education_accreditation
