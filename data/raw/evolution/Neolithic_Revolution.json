See [[agricultural revolution (disambiguation)]] for later historical\n: breakthroughs in agriculture.\n\n\n\nThe 'Neolithic Revolution' or 'Neolithic Demographic Transition', sometimes\ncalled the 'Agricultural Revolution', was the world's first historically\nverifiable revolution in agriculture. It was the wide-scale transition of many\nhuman cultures from a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture\nand settlement which supported an increasingly large population. Archaeological data indicates that various forms of plants and\nanimal domestication evolved in separate locations worldwide, starting in the\ngeological epoch of the Holocene {{cite web\n| url=http://www.westfalen-blatt.de/nachricht/2012-11-25-klimaschutz-die-ziele-\n| schmelzen-dahin/613/ title=International Stratigraphic Chart\n|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy\n| accessdate=2012-12-06\n}} around 12,000 14 C years ago (12,000â7,000 BP).\n\nHowever, the Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a\nlimited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it would\ntransform the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto\ndominated human history into sedentary societies based in built-up villages and\ntowns, which radically modified their natural environment by means of\nspecialized food-crop cultivation (e.g., irrigation and food storage\ntechnologies) that allowed extensive surplus food production. These developments\nprovided the basis for high population density settlements, specialized and\ncomplex labor diversification, trading economies, the development of non-\nportable art, architecture, and culture, centralized administrations and\npolitical structures, hierarchical ideologies, and depersonalized systems of\nknowledge (e.g., property regimes and writing). The first full-blown\nmanifestation of the entire Neolithic complex is seen in the Middle Eastern\nSumerian cities (ca. 5,500 BP), whose emergence also inaugurates the end of the\nprehistoric Neolithic period.\n\nThe relationship of the above-mentioned Neolithic characteristics to the onset\nof agriculture, their sequence of emergence, and empirical relation to each\nother at various Neolithic sites remains the subject of academic debate, and\nseems to vary from place to place, rather than being the outcome of universal\nlaws of social evolution.
