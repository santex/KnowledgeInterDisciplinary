This\nstrongly overlaps the field of linguistic anthropology, which is the branch of\nanthropology that studies humans through the languages that they use.\n\nWhatever one calls it, this field has had a major impact in the studies of such\nareas as visual perception (especially colour) and bioregional democracy, both\nof which are concerned with distinctions that are made in languages about\nperceptions of the surroundings.\n\nConventional linguistic anthropology also has implications for sociology and self-\norganization of peoples. Study of the Penan people, for instance, reveals that\ntheir language employs six different and distinct words whose best English\ntranslation is \"we\". Anthropological linguistics studies these distinctions, and\nrelates them to types of societies and to actual bodily adaptation to the\nsenses, much as it studies distinctions made in languages regarding the colours\nof the rainbow: seeing the tendency to increase the diversity of terms, as\nevidence that there are distinctions that bodies in this environment must make,\nleading to situated knowledge and perhaps a situated ethics, whose final\nevidence is the differentiated set of terms used to denote \"we\".\n","linknr":194,"url":"Anthropological_linguistics","recorded":1362480884,"links":26,"instances":["linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Anthropological linguistics"],"headings":["Related Fields","Recent work","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["morphology","linguistics"]],"members":["morphology"],"related":["Language","Culture","Human_biology","Cognition","Language","Linguistic_anthropology","Visual_perception","Colour","Bioregional_democracy","Sociology","Self-organization","Penan","We","Types_of_societies","Situated_knowledge","Situated_ethics","Phonology","Morphology_(linguistics)","Syntax","Semantics","Grammar","Language_families_and_languages","Comparative_method","Etymology","Philology","Mark_Fettes","Sociological_naturalism","Transformative_ecology","Activism","Participant_observer","Philosophy","Who's_we","Subject-object_problem","Anthropology","Linguistics","Linguistic_relativity","Linguistic_anthropology","Gender_role_in_language","Sociolinguistics","Sociology_of_language","World_Oral_Literature_Project"]}
