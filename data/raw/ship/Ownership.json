Determining\nownership in law involves determining who has certain rights and duties over the\nproperty. These rights and duties, sometimes called a 'bundle of rights', can be\nseparated and held by different parties.\n\nThe question of ownership reaches back to the ancient philosophers, Plato and\nAristotle, who held different opinions on the subject. Plato (428/427BC-\n348/347BC) thought private property created divisive inequalities, while\nAristotle (384BC-322BC) thought private property enabled people to receive the\nfull benefit of their labor. Private property can circumvent what is now\nreferred to as the âtragedy of the commonsâ problem, where people tend to\ndegrade common property more than they do private property. Given a short-\nsighted owner, however, a private property system can make these tragedies worse--\nfor example, a private owner of a piece of oil-rich property, depending on his\nworldview, might be more interested in short-term financial gain than\nincremental use with an eye toward other's concerns (e.g., those of future\ngenerations, the disenfranchised, etc.). While Aristotle justified the existence\nof private ownership, he left open questions of (1) how to allocate property\nbetween what is private and common and (2) how to allocate the private property\nwithin society. Politics 1263a8 15 as quoted in Mayhew 1995 p. 566\n\nOver the millennia, and across cultures what can be property and how it is\nregarded culturally have varied widely. Ownership is the basis for many other\nconcepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as\nmoney, trade, debt, bankruptcy, the criminality of theft, and private vs. public\nproperty. Ownership is the key building block in the development of the\ncapitalist socio-economic system. Adam Smith stated that one of the sacred laws\nof justice was to guard a person's property and possessions. Theory of Moral\nSentiments. Ed. A.L. Macfie and D.D. Raphael. Indianapolis: Liberty Press, 1982,\nII.ii.2.3\n\nThe process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex: one can gain,\ntransfer and lose ownership of property in a number of ways. To acquire property\none can purchase it with money, trade it for other property, receive it as a\ngift, steal it, find it, make, it or homestead it. One can transfer or lose\nownership of property by selling it for money, exchanging it for other property,\ngiving it as a gift, being robbed of it, it, or having it stripped from one's\nownership through legal means such as eviction, foreclosure, seizure, or taking.\nOwnership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own\nthe economic benefits of that property.\n","linknr":357,"url":"Ownership","recorded":1362570332,"links":31,"instances":["law","legal_system","observation","accounting","law","finance","english_law","ownership_right","semiotics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Legal terms","Property| Ownership"],"headings":["Types of owners","Types of property","Critical views of ownership","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Wikiquote-logo-en.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["discovery","observation"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["good","accounting"],["security","finance"],["chose","english_law"],["civil_law","legal_system"],["property","ownership_right"],["sign","semiotics"],["security","finance"],["public_policy","law"],["possession","law"]],"members":["possession","civil_law","discovery","good","public_policy","security","chose","property","sign"],"related":["Personal_property","Land_ownership","Intellectual_property","Tragedy_of_the_commons","Money","Trade","Debt","Bankruptcy","Criminality","Theft","Capitalism","Adam_Smith","Gift","Discovery_(observation)","Manufacturing","Homestead_principle","Sell","Exchange","Eviction","Foreclosure","Search_and_seizure","Taking","Haudenosaunee","Matrilinear","Legal_person","Cooperative","National_parks","Tragedy_of_the_Commons","Over-exploitation","Communist","State_ownership","Jurisdiction","Public_property","Personal_Property","Asset","Common_ownership","Communal_ownership","Collective_ownership","Private_property","Shareholders","Worker_Cooperative","Property","Common_law","Real_property","Real_estate","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Movable_property","Immovable_property","Good_(accounting)","Money","Negotiable_instrument","Security_(finance)","Intangible_assets","Chose_(English_law)","Immovable_property","Law","Building","Personal_property","Common_law","Civil_law_(legal_system)","Jurisdiction","Immovable_property","Latin","Property","Business","Legal","Natural_person","Individual","Credit_union","Foundation","Cooperative","Idea-expression_divide","Idea","Intangible_asset","Exclusive_right","Mind","Property_(ownership_right)","Bundle_of_rights","Exclusive_right","Idea-expression_divide","Copyright","Patent","Invention","Trademark","Sign_(semiotics)","Business","Industrial_design_right","Trade_secret","Confidentiality","Property","Industrial_property","Consideration","Gift","License","Security_(finance)","Public_policy_(law)","Innovation","Public_domain","Common_good","Traditional_knowledge","Software_patent","Business_method_patent","Controversy","Jurisdiction","North-South_divide","Human_body","Person","Body","Slavery","Political_left","Political_right","Right-libertarians","Ownership_society","George_W._Bush","Vedic_Brahmanism","Vedanta","Bubuti_system","Cadastre","Dominium","Owned","Ownership_society","Possession_(law)","Public_ownership"]}
