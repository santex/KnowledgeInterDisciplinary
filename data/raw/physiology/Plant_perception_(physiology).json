{"cursor":"23960","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n.]] In botany, 'plant perception' is the ability of plants to sense the\nenvironment and adjust their morphology, physiology and phenotype\naccordingly. Research draws on the fields of plant physiology,\necology and molecular biology. Examples of stimuli which plants perceive and can\nreact to include chemicals, gravity, light, moisture, infections, temperature,\noxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, parasite infestation, physical\ndisruption, and touch. Plants have a variety of means to detect such stimuli and\na variety of reaction responses or behaviors.\n","linknr":540,"url":"Plant_perception_(physiology)","recorded":1362373146,"links":49,"instances":["biology","ecology","physiology","biology","paranormal"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Plant physiology"],"headings":["Processes","Aspects of perception","Plant intelligence","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Mimosa_pudica_open.JPG/230px-Mimosa_pudica_open.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Mimosa_pudica_closed.JPG/230px-Mimosa_pudica_closed.JPG","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Grapevines_intelligent_growth_1.jpg/225px-Grapevines_intelligent_growth_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Sonnenblume-hjf.jpg/250px-Sonnenblume-hjf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Laelops-Charles_Knight-1896.jpg/140px-Laelops-Charles_Knight-1896.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stimulus","physiology"],["stimulus","physiology"],["cell","biology"],["adaptive_behaviour","ecology"],["kinesis","biology"],["plant_perception","paranormal"]],"members":["kinesis","adaptive_behaviour","stimulus","cell","plant_perception"],"related":["Botany","Plant","Plant_morphology","Plant_physiology","Phenotypic_plasticity","Plant_physiology","Plant_ecology","Molecular_biology","Chemical","Gravity","Light","Moisture","Infection","Temperature","Oxygen","Carbon_dioxide","Parasite","Touch","Stimulus_(physiology)","Behavior","Arabidopsis_thaliana","Cryptochrome","Poplar","Equilibrioception","Plant_hormone","Signalling_pathway","Plant_development","Acetylcholine_esterase","Glutamate_receptor","GABA_receptor","Endocannabinoid","Adenosine_triphosphate","Nitric_oxide","Reactive_oxygen_species","Action_potential","Actin","Photosynthesis","Organic_compound","Neuroactive_substance","Organism","Behavior","Plant_communication","Plant_ecology","Action_potential","Actin","Rapid_plant_movement","Photosynthesis","Phytochrome","Kinin","Plant_hormone","Antibiotic","Time-lapse","Rapid_plant_movement","Jasmonate","Inducible_plant_defenses_against_herbivory","Phytoalexin","Cell_death","Rapid_plant_movement","Carnivorous_plant","Venus_flytrap","Signal_transduction","Plant_nutrition","Inducible_plant_defenses_against_herbivory","Phototropin","Cryptochrome","Phytochrome","Phototropism","Phototropin","Phytochrome","Auxin","Photoperiodism","Phytochrome","Neuronal_network","Photosynthate","Stimulus_(physiology)","Tropism","Plant_morphology","Cost–benefit_analysis","Signal_transduction","Plant_genetics","Molecular","Phytochemistry","Cell_(biology)","Phytocoenosis","Plant_evolution","Order_of_magnitude","David_Stenhouse","Charles_Darwin","The_Power_of_Movement_in_Plants","Radicle","Phenomenology","Neurobiological","Animal","Adaptive_behaviour_(ecology)","Electrophysiology","J._C._Bose","Neuron","Gerd_Jürgens","Plasmodesmata","Auxin","Chemotropism","Cryptochrome","Ethylene","Gravitropism","Heliotropism","Hormonal_sentience","Hydrotropism","Hypersensitive_response","Kairomone","Kinesis_(biology)","Nastic_movements","Osmosis","Phototropin","Phototropism","Phytochrome","Phytosemiotics","Plant_defense_against_herbivory","Plant_evolutionary_developmental_biology","Plant_hormone","Plant_perception_(paranormal)","Plant_physiology","Plant_tolerance_to_herbivory","Rapid_plant_movement","Sensory_receptors","Statolith","Stoma","Systemic_acquired_resistance","Taxis","Lower_plant","Thermotropism","Thigmotropism","Tropism","Iowa_State_University","Plant_cell","APS_Press","Sinauer_Associates","Oxford_University_Press"]}
