The Institute is also occasionally referred to as\n\"CIT\", most notably in its alma mater, but this is uncommon. is a private\nresearch university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Caltech has\nsix academic divisions with strong emphases on science and engineering. Its\nprimary campus is located approximately northeast of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in\n1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale,\nArthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The\nvocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the\ncollege assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the\nAssociation of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were\nestablished between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n.\n\nDespite its small size, 31 Caltech alumni and faculty have won the Nobel Prize\nand 66 have won the United States National Medal of Science or\nTechnology. There are 110 faculty members who have been\nelected to the National Academies. In addition, numerous faculty members are\nassociated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as NASA. Caltech managed $332 million in 2011 in sponsored research\nand $1.75 billion for its endowment in 2012. Caltech was ranked first in the 2012â2013 Times Higher\nEducation World University Rankings for the second year running, as well as\nranking first in Engineering & Technology and Physical Sciences. http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-\nrankings/ It also has a long standing rivalry with the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology (MIT).\n\nFirst year students are required to live on campus, and 95% of undergraduates\nremain in the on-campus house system. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of\npractical jokes and pranks, student life is\ngoverned by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations.\nThe Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division\nIII's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.\n","linknr":1716,"url":"California_Institute_of_Technology","recorded":1362480448,"links":151,"instances":["secretary_of_defense","sculpture","dwarf_planet","electronics","programming_language","film_series","ncaa","sport","pasadena","ncaa","magazine","computer_scientist"],"pdf":["http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2012NCSEPublicTablesEndowmentMarketValuesFinalJanuary232013.pdf","http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/research/2012NCSEPublicTablesEndowmentMarketValuesFinalJanuary232013.pdf","http://marcomm.caltech.edu/pdf/Caltech_Overview_2010_2011.pdf","http://marcomm.caltech.edu/pdf/Caltech_Overview_2010_2011.pdf","http://catalog.caltech.edu/pdf/catalog_10_11.pdf","http://catalog.caltech.edu/pdf/catalog_10_11.pdf","http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/125/01/OH_Acosta.pdf","http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/125/01/OH_Acosta.pdf","http://pandora.caltech.edu/~antognini/tunnels.pdf","http://pandora.caltech.edu/~antognini/tunnels.pdf","http://one.caltech.edu/homepage/campaign_brochure.pdf","http://one.caltech.edu/homepage/campaign_brochure.pdf","http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2008-report.pdf","http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2008-report.pdf","http://finance.caltech.edu/budget/cds2011%20FINAL%204_28_11.pdf","http://finance.caltech.edu/budget/cds2011%20FINAL%204_28_11.pdf","http://www.deans.caltech.edu/PDF/FAHOct09.pdf","http://www.deans.caltech.edu/PDF/FAHOct09.pdf","http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/11-2011-12_appinstructions_required_tests.pdf","http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/11-2011-12_appinstructions_required_tests.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab27.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab27.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab35.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab35.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab70.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab70.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab71.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf10311/pdf/tab71.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf07325/pdf/tab12.pdf","http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf07325/pdf/tab12.pdf","http://www.surf.caltech.edu/history/SURFAR2010.pdf","http://www.surf.caltech.edu/history/SURFAR2010.pdf","http://tech.caltech.edu/archive/scanned-archive/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf","http://tech.caltech.edu/archive/scanned-archive/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf","http://heri.ucla.edu/nih/HERI_ResearchBrief_OL_2010_STEM.pdf","http://heri.ucla.edu/nih/HERI_ResearchBrief_OL_2010_STEM.pdf"],"categories":["California
