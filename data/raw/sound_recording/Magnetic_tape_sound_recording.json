Magnetizable tape\n revolutionized both the radio broadcast and music recording industries. It gave\n artists and producers the power to record and re-record audio with minimal loss\n in quality as well as edit and rearrange recordings with ease. The alternative\n recording technologies of the era, transcription discs and wire recorders,\n could not provide anywhere near this level of quality and functionality. Since\n some early refinements improved the fidelity of the reproduced sound, magnetic\n tape has been the highest quality analog sound recording medium available.\n However, as of the first decade of the 21st century, analog magnetic tape is\n largely being replaced by digital recording technologies for most sound\n recording purposes.\n\nPrior to the development of magnetic tape, magnetic wire recorders had\nsuccessfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never\noffered audio quality comparable to the recording and broadcast standards of the\ntime. Some individuals and organizations developed innovative uses for magnetic\nwire recorders while others investigated variations of the technology. One\nparticularly important variation was the application of an oxide powder to a\nlong strip of paper. This German invention was the start of a long string of\ninnovations that have led to present day magnetic tape recordings.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Magnetic_tape_sound_recording","recorded":1362897701,"links":18,"instances":["german"],"pdf":["http://www.richardhess.com/tape/history/Engel_Hammar--Magnetic_Tape_History.pdf","http://www.richardhess.com/tape/history/Engel--Walter_Weber_2006.pdf"],"categories":["Audio storage","Sound recording"],"headings":["Origins","Commercialization","Innovative uses","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Klaudia_Wilde_WDR_Archiv.jpg/220px-Klaudia_Wilde_WDR_Archiv.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["radio_luxembourg","german"]],"members":["radio_luxembourg"],"related":["Magnetization","Transcription_disc","Wire_recorder","Analog_signal","Digital_recording","Wire_recording","Magnetic_recording","Magnetic_recording","Oberlin_Smith","Valdemar_Poulsen","Wire_recording","Magnetic_tape","Bell_Labs","British_Broadcasting_Corporation","Brush_Development_Company","3M","BASF","IG_Farben","AEG","Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft","Fritz_Pfleumer","Eduard_Schüller","AC_bias","World_War_II","Allied_Forces","Richard_H._Ranger","Magnetophon","Radio_Luxembourg_(German)","Ampex","Minnesota_Mining_and_Manufacturing","John_T._Mullin","Bing_Crosby","Bad_Nauheim","Bing_Crosby","Transcription_disc","Ampex","Alexander_M._Poniatoff","8-track_tape","Bill_Lear","Compact_Cassette","Philips","Sony","Walkman","Dolby_noise-reduction_system","Les_Paul","Multitrack_tape_recorder","Musique_Concrète","Karlheinz_Stockhausen","Pop_music","Frank_Zappa","The_Beatles","The_Beach_Boys","Media_monitoring","Multitrack_recording","Tape_echo","Fidelipac","Analog_recording","Audio_format","Audio_tape_length_and_thickness","Tape_recorder","Magnetic_recording","Multitrack_recording","Preservation_of_magnetic_audiotape","Reel-to-reel_audio_tape_recording","Tape_recorder","Sound_follower"]}
