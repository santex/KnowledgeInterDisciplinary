{"cursor":"19988","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn toxicology, the 'median lethal dose', 'LD 50 ' (abbreviation for\nâlethal dose, 50%â), 'LC 50 ' (lethal concentration, 50%) or\n'LCt 50 ' (lethal concentration & time) of a toxin, radiation, or\npathogen is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population\nafter a specified test duration. LD 50 figures are frequently used as\na general indicator of a substance's acute toxicity. The test was created by\nJ.W. Trevan in 1927. [http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html\nWhat is an LD50 and LC50] The term 'semilethal dose' is occasionally used\nwith the same meaning, in particular in translations from non-English-language\ntexts, but can also refer to a sublethal dose; because of this ambiguity, it is\nusually avoided. LD 50 is usually determined by tests on animals such\nas laboratory mice. In 2011 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved\nalternative methods to LD 50 for testing the cosmetic drug BOTOX.\n{{Cite web\n| date = Page last updated 24 June 2011 title = Allergan Receives FDA Approval\n| for First-of-Its-Kind, Fully in vitro, Cell-Based Assay for BOTOXÂ® and BOTOXÂ®\n| Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) publisher = Allergan Web site url =\n| http://agn.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=587234\n| accessdate = 2012-08-15\n}} {{Cite web\n| date = Page last updated 12 April 2008 title = In U.S., Few Alternatives To\n| Testing On Animals publisher = Washington Post url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-\n| dyn/content/article/2008/04/11/AR2008041103733.html accessdate = 2011-06-26\n}}\n","linknr":499,"url":"Median_lethal_concentration","recorded":1362568259,"links":46,"instances":["unit","pharmacology","pharmacology","nerve_agent"],"pdf":["http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf","http://www.alfa.com/content/msds/german/A14544.pdf","http://www.merck-chemicals.com/documents/sds/emd/deu/de/1001/100115.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/adbac_red.pdf","http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/adbac_red.pdf","http://www.palomar.edu/ehs/Chemistry%20MSDS/COUMARIN.pdf","http://www.valero.com/V_MSDS/SpentMetalCatalyst901.pdf","http://assets.chemportals.merck.de/documents/sds/emd/deu/de/1020/102015.pdf","http://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chris/PTB.pdf","http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp103-c2.pdf"],"categories":["Toxicology"],"headings":["Conventions","Limitation","Examples","Animal rights concerns","See also","Other measures of toxicity","Related measures","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["dose","pharmacology"],["effective_dose","pharmacology"],["cobalt(ii_chloride"],["mercury(ii_chloride"],["vx","nerve_agent"],["gray","unit"]],"members":["gray","effective_dose","dose","vx"],"related":["Toxicology","Lethal_dose","Toxin","Radiation","Pathogen","Dose_(pharmacology)","Acute_toxicity","Laboratory_mice","Food_and_Drug_Administration","Washington_Post","Botulinum","Paracetamol","Intravenous_therapy","Radiation_Health_Physics","Chemical_warfare","Fritz_Haber","Hydrogen_cyanide","Material_Safety_Data_Sheet","Biological_warfare","Venom","Snakes","Venomous_snakes","Mongoose","Mammals","Effective_dose_(pharmacology)","Therapeutic_index","Water","Sucrose","Monosodium_glutamate","Vitamin_C","Cyanuric_acid","Cadmium_sulfide","Ethanol","Melamine","Melamine_cyanurate","Sodium_molybdate","Sodium_chloride","Paracetamol","Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol","Arsenic","ADBAC","United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency","Coumarin","Benzopyrone","Cinnamomum_aromaticum","Aspirin","Caffeine","Arsenic_trisulfide","Sodium_nitrite","Bisoprolol","Cobalt(II)_chloride","Cadmium_oxide","Sodium_fluoride","Nicotine","Pentaborane","Capsaicin","Mercury(II)_chloride","Lysergic_acid_diethylamide","Arsenic_trioxide","Arsenic","Intraperitoneal","Sodium_cyanide","White_phosphorus","Strychnine","Cantharidin","Aflatoxin","Inland_Taipan","Ricin","Polychlorinated_dibenzodioxins","Sarin","VX_(nerve_agent)","Batrachotoxin","Hydrophis_belcheri","Intraperitoneal","Maitotoxin","Intraperitoneal","Polonium","Botulinum_toxin","Ionizing_radiation","Gray_(unit)","Animal_rights","Animal_welfare","United_Kingdom","Organization_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development","Animal_testing","Reed-Muench_method","IDLH","Certain_safety_factor","Therapeutic_index","Protective_index","Fixed_Dose_Procedure","Median_toxic_dose","Lowest_published_lethal_dose","EC50","IC50","Draize_test","Indicative_limit_value","No-observed-adverse-effect_level","Lowest-observed-adverse-effect_level","Up-and-down_procedure","TCID50","Plaque_forming_units"]}
