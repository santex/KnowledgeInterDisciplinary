Its drafting by the Continental Congress\nbegan in mid-1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for\nratification in late 1777. The formal ratification by all 13 states was\ncompleted in early 1781. Even when not yet ratified, the Articles provided\ndomestic and international legitimacy for the Continental Congress to direct the\nAmerican Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with Europe and deal with\nterritorial issues and Indian relations. Nevertheless, the weak government\ncreated by the Articles became a matter of concern for key nationalists. On\nMarch 4, 1789, the Articles were replaced with the U.S.\nConstitution. The new Constitution provided for a much\nstronger national government with a chief executive (the president), courts, and\ntaxing powers.\n","linknr":934,"url":"Articles_of_Confederation","recorded":1362576005,"links":45,"instances":["congressman","delegate","delegate","united_states_land_surveying","united_states","lawyer","delegate","governor","delegate","person","1786","lawyer","american_revolution","delegate","politician","governor","statesman","jurist","1783","delegate","merchant","governor"],"pdf":["http://www.mises.org/books/conceived4.pdf"],"categories":["1781
