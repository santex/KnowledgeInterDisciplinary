Aversive\nagentsâprimarily bitterants and pungent agentsâare used to produce an unpleasant\nflavor. For example, the bitterant denatonium might be added to food used in the\nlaboratory, where the food is not intended for human consumption. A poison may\nbe added as an even more powerful deterrent. For example, methanol is added to\nethanol to produce denatured alcohol. The addition of poisonous methanol renders\ndenatured alcohol unfit for consumption. Thus denatured alcohol is not subject\nto the taxes alcoholic beverages are subject to.\n","linknr":102,"url":"Denaturation_(food)","recorded":1362688436,"links":27,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Food additives"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Biscuit_components.jpg/35px-Biscuit_components.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Aversive_agent","Bitterant","Pungent","Denatonium","Laboratory","Poison","Methanol","Ethanol","Denatured_alcohol","Denatured_alcohol","Denatured_alcohol","Alcoholic_beverages"]}
