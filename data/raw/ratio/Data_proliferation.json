While originally pertaining to problems associated\nwith paper documentation, data proliferation has become a major problem in\nprimary and secondary data storage on computers.\n\nWhile digital storage has become cheaper, the associated costs, from raw power\nto maintenance and from metadata to search engines, have not kept up with the\nproliferation of data. Although the power required to maintain a unit of data\nhas fallen, the cost of facilities which house the digital storage has tended to\nrise. {{cite web |url =http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Downsizing-digital-attic-\ndata-storage.cfm |title=Downsizing the digital attic |work=Deloitte Technology\nPredictions |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110722194032/http://www.de-\nloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Downsizing-digital-attic-data-storage.cfm\n|archivedate=July 22, 2011}}\n\n\n\nData proliferation has been documented as a problem for the U.S. military since\nAugust 1971, in particular regarding the excessive documentation submitted\nduring the acquisition of major weapon systems.
