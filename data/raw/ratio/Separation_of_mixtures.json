{"cursor":"7671","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn chemistry and chemical engineering, a 'separation process', or simply a\n'separation', is any mass transfer process that converts a mixture of\nsubstances into two or more distinct product mixtures, at least one of which is\nenriched in one or more of the mixture's constituents. In some cases, a\nseparation may fully divide the mixture into its pure constituents. Separations\nare carried out based on differences in chemical properties such as size,\nshape, mass, or chemical affinity between the constituents of a mixture, and\nare often classified according to the particular differences they use to\nachieve separation. In the case that no single difference can be used to\naccomplish a desired separation, multiple processes will often be performed in\ncombination to achieve the desired end.\n\nBarring a few exceptions, almost every element or compound is naturally found in\nan impure state. Often these impure raw materials must be separated into their\npurified components after they can be put to productive use, making separation\nprocesses essential for the modern industrial economy. In some cases these\nseparations require total purification, as in the electrolysis refining of\nbauxite ore for aluminum metal, but a good example of an incomplete separation\nprocess is oil refining. Crude oil occurs naturally as a mixture of various\nhydrocarbons and impurities. The refining process splits this mixture into\nother, more valuable mixtures such as natural gas, gasoline and chemical\nfeedstocks, none of which are pure substances, but each of which must be\nseparated from the raw crude. In both these cases a series of separations is\nnecessary to obtain the desired end products. In the case of oil refining, crude\nis subjected to a long series of individual distillation steps, each of which\nproduces a different product or intermediate.\n\nThis article discusses separation processes of any scale that completely or\npartially separate components of a mixture from each other (which may be\nreferred to as fractions) usually without substantial chemical\nmodification. Encyclopedia of Separation Science - M.Cooke,C.Poole The\npurpose of such a separation may be analytical, i.e. to help analyze components\nin the original mixture without any attempt to save the fractions, or may be\npreparative, i.e. to \"prepare\" fractions or samples of the components that can\nbe saved. The separation can be done on a small scale, effectively a laboratory-\nscale for analytical or preparative purposes, or on a large scale, effectively\nan industrial-scale for preparative purposes, or on some intermediate scale.\n","linknr":341,"url":"Separation_of_mixtures","recorded":1362479204,"links":50,"instances":["biochemistry","chemistry","chemistry","physics","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","vapor"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry","Chemical engineering","Unit operations","Separation processes"],"headings":["Chromatography","Core theories and concepts","Methods","Applications","See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cf/Copyright-problem.svg/37px-Copyright-problem.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6c/Wiki_letter_w.svg/23px-Wiki_letter_w.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/ChemSepProcDiagram.svg/81px-ChemSepProcDiagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["demister","vapor"],["extraction","chemistry"],["leaching","chemistry"],["dialysis","biochemistry"],["precipitation","chemistry"],["recrystallization","chemistry"],["stripping","chemistry"],["sublimation","physics"]],"members":["dialysis","recrystallization","extraction","sublimation","stripping","precipitation","leaching","demister"],"related":["Chemistry","Chemical_engineering","Mass_transfer","Mixture","Chemical_element","Chemical_compound","Hall–Héroult_process_","Bauxite","Aluminum","Petroleum_","Hydrocarbon_","Natural_gas","Gasoline","Distillation","Laboratory","Adsorption","Centrifugation","Cyclonic_separation","Chromatography","Crystallization","Decantation","Demister_(vapor)","Distillation","Drying","Electrophoresis","Gel","Elutriation","Evaporation","Extraction_(chemistry)","Leaching_(chemistry)","Liquid-liquid_extraction","Solid_phase_extraction","Flotation","Dissolved_air_flotation","Froth_flotation","Deinking","Paper_recycling","Flocculation","Filtration","Mesh","Fly_ash","Membrane_technology","Microfiltration","Ultrafiltration","Nanofiltration","Reverse_osmosis","Dialysis_(biochemistry)","Synthetic_membrane","Micrometre","Fractional_distillation","Fractional_freezing","API_oil-water_separator","Oil_refinery","Petrochemical","Chemical_plant","Natural_gas_processing","Magnetic_separation","Precipitation_(chemistry)","Recrystallization_(chemistry)","Sedimentation","Gravity_separation","Sieving","Stripping_(chemistry)","Sublimation_(physics)","Souders-Brown_equation","Winnowing","Zone_refining","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","Analytical_chemistry","Chemical_engineering","Unit_operations"]}
