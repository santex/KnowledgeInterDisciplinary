{"cursor":"42133","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\ns for 2008: positive (blue), negative (orange), stable (green), and no data\n(gray)]] -based chart of large human migrations (Numbers are millennia before\npresent.)]]\n\n'Human migration' (derived from Latin: migratio) is movement by humans from one\narea to another, sometimes over long distances or in large groups. Historically\nthis movement was nomadic, often causing significant conflict with the\nindigenous population and their displacement or cultural assimilation. Only a\nfew nomadic people have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times.\nMigration has continued under the form of both voluntary migration within one's\nregion, country, or beyond and involuntary migration (which includes the slave\ntrade, trafficking in human beings and ethnic cleansing). People who migrate\ninto a territory are called immigrants, while at the departure point they are\ncalled emigrants. Small populations migrating to develop a territory considered\nvoid of settlement depending on historical setting, circumstances and\nperspective are referred to as settlers or colonists, while populations\ndisplaced by immigration and colonization are called refugees. The rest of this\narticle will cover sense of a \"change of residence\", rather than the temporary\nmigrations of travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute.\n","linknr":553,"url":"Human_migration","recorded":1362668805,"links":59,"instances":["people","african_american","journal"],"pdf":["http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf","http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf"],"categories":["Human
