An international non-governmental\norganization (INGO) has the same mission as a non-governmental organization\n(NGO), but it is international in scope and has outposts around the world to\ndeal with specific issues in many countries.\n\nBoth terms, NGO and INGO, should be differentiated from intergovernmental\norganizations (IGOs), which describes groups such as the United Nations or the\nInternational Labour Organization. An INGO may be founded by private\nphilanthropy, such as the Carnegie, Rockefeller, Gates and Ford Foundations, or\nas an adjunct to existing international organizations, such as the Catholic or\nLutheran churches. A surge in the founding of development INGOs occurred during\nWorld War II, some of which would later become the large development INGOs like\nOxfam, Catholic Relief Services, CARE International, and Lutheran World Relief.\n\nInternational Non-governmental Organizations can further be defined by their\nprimary purpose. World Bank and NGOs.\" October 3, 2007.http://library.duke.-\nedu/research/subject/guides/ngo_guide/igo_ngo_coop/ngo_wb.html (accessed\nNovember 10, 2010). Some INGOs are operational, meaning that their primary\npurpose is to foster the community based organizations within each country via\ndifferent projects and operations. Some INGOs are advocacy-based, meaning that\ntheir primary purpose is to influence the policy-making of different countriesâ\ngovernments regarding certain issues or promote the awareness of a certain\nissue. Many of the large INGOs have components of both operational projects and\nadvocacy initiatives working together within individual countries.\n","linknr":221,"url":"International_non-governmental_organization","recorded":1362669472,"links":20,"instances":["aid_organisation","relief_agency"],"pdf":[],"categories":["International nongovernmental organizations|*"],"headings":["Criteria","INGOs and Development","Debate","Case Studies","Examples of INGOs","See also","Further reading","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["care","relief_agency"],["care","relief_agency"],["care","relief_agency"],["plan","aid_organisation"],["foundation","non-profit"]],"members":["plan","care","foundation"],"related":["World_Bank","Non-governmental_organization","Intergovernmental_organization","United_Nations","International_Labour_Organization","Ford_Foundation","World_War_II","Oxfam","Catholic_Relief_Services","CARE_(relief_agency)","Lutheran_World_Relief","CARE_(relief_agency)","Amnesty_International","Oxfam","CARE_(relief_agency)","Oxfam","World_Vision_International","CAFOD","Médecins_Sans_Frontières","HealthRight_International","International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross","Compassion_International","Plan_(aid_organisation)","Save_the_Children_International","SOS_Children's_Villages","Reggio_Children_Foundation","ActionAid","The_Library_Project","Amnesty_International","International_Federation_for_Human_Rights","Friends_of_Peoples_Close_to_Nature","Survival_International","International_POPs_Elimination_Network","International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature","Greenpeace","World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature","Foundation_(non-profit)","International_Non-Governmental_Organisations_Accountability_Charter","Non-governmental_organization","Nonprofit_organization","Think_tank"]}
