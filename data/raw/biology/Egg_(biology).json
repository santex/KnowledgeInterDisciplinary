{"cursor":"27839","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n::The article is about the Egg in biology, for other uses of the word see [[Egg\n:(disambiguation)]]\n, a reptile, various cartilaginous fish, a cuttlefish and various butterflies\nand moths. (Click on image for key)|right|thumb]] In zoology, an 'egg' is an\norganic vessel in which an embryo first begins to develop. In most birds,\nreptiles, insects, molluscs, fish, and monotremes, an 'egg' (Latin,\n[[wikt:en:ovum#Latin|ovum]]) is the zygote, resulting from fertilization of the\novum, which is expelled from the body and permitted to develop outside the body\nuntil the developing embryo can survive on its own. The term \"egg\" is used\ndifferently outside the animal kingdom, for an egg cell (sometimes called an\novum). Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed\nspores, or (in spermatophytes) seeds.\n\nOviparous animals are animals that lay eggs, with little or no other development\nwithin the mother. The study or collecting of eggs, particularly bird eggs, is\ncalled oology.\n\nReptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs, which are laid out of water, are\nsurrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible. The special\nmembranes that support these eggs are traits of all amniotes, including mammals.\n\nEggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a favourable temperature\nrange (warm) while the embryo grows. When the embryo is adequately developed it\nbreaks out of the egg's shell. This breaking out is known as hatching. Baby\nanimals which have just hatched are hatchlings, though standard names for babies\nof particular species continue to apply, such as chick for a baby chicken. Some\nembryos have a temporary egg tooth with which to crack, pip, or break the\neggshell or covering.\n\nThe ostrich egg is the largest egg currently known, though the extinct\n[[Aepyornis]] and some dinosaurs had larger eggs. The Bee Hummingbird produces\nthe smallest known bird egg, which weighs half of a gram. The eggs laid by some\nreptiles and most fish can be even smaller, and those of insects and other\ninvertebrates can be much smaller still.\n","linknr":721,"url":"Egg_(biology)","recorded":1362898101,"links":125,"instances":["biology","fish","geometry","disambiguation","united_states_coin","biology","chondrichthyes","eggs","bird","food"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Eggs|","Animal
