Viruses can infect all types of organisms, from animals\nand plants to bacteria and archaea.\n\nSince Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen\ninfecting tobacco plants, and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by\nMartinus Beijerinck in 1898, about 5,000 viruses have been\ndescribed in detail, Dimmock p. 49 although there\nare millions of different types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the\nmost abundant type of biological entity. The\nstudy of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality of microbiology.\n\nVirus particles (known as virions) consist of two or three parts: i) the genetic\nmaterial made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic\ninformation; ii) a protein coat that protects these genes; and in some cases\niii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside\na cell. The shapes of viruses range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to\nmore complex structures. The average virus is about one one-hundredth the size\nof the average bacterium. Most viruses are too small to be seen directly with an\noptical microscope.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may\nhave evolved from plasmids â pieces of DNA that can move between\ncells â while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses\nare an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic\ndiversity. Viruses are considered by some to be a life\nform, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural\nselection. However they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that\nare generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some\nbut not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the\nedge of life\".\n\nViruses spread in many ways; viruses in plants are often transmitted from plant\nto plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; viruses in animals\ncan be carried by blood-sucking insects. These disease-bearing organisms are\nknown as vectors. Influenza viruses are spread by coughing and sneezing.\nNorovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted\nby the faecal–oral route and are passed from person to person by contact,\nentering the body in food or water. HIV is one of several viruses transmitted\nthrough sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. The range of host\ncells that a virus can infect is called its \"host range\". This can be narrow or,\nas when a virus is capable of infecting many species, broad. Shors pp.\n49â50\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates\nthe infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which\nconfer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection.\nHowever, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade\nthese immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics have no\neffect on viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.\n","linknr":1982,"url":"Virus_(biology)","recorded":1362484358,"links":208,"instances":["disease","medical","fluorescence","epidemiology","biology","medical","biology","genetics","biology","molecular_biology","chemistry","biology","genetics","bacterium","journal","biochemistry","microbiology","biology","molecular_biology","biology","biology"],"pdf":["http://www.icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2005/december/1201.pdf","http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2008/jc1510_2008_global_report_pp29_62_en.pdf"],"categories":["Virology|*","Viruses|Viruses"],"headings":["Etymology","History","Origins","Microbiology","Classification","Role
