{"cursor":"11609","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n'''\n\n'Cell biology' (formerly 'cytology', from the Greek kytos, \"contain\") is a\nscientific discipline that studies cells â their physiological properties, their\nstructure, the organelles they contain, interactions with their environment,\ntheir life cycle, division and death. This is done both on a microscopic and\nmolecular level. Cell biology research encompasses both the great diversity of\nsingle-celled organisms like bacteria and protozoa, as well as the many\nspecialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans.\n\nKnowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all\nbiological sciences. Appreciating the similarities and differences between cell\ntypes is particularly important to the fields of cell and molecular biology as\nwell as to biomedical fields such as cancer research and developmental biology.\nThese fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme,\nsometimes allowing the principles learned from studying one cell type to be\nextrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Therefore, research in cell\nbiology is closely related to genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology,\nimmunology, and developmental biology.
