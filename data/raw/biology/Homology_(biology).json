{"cursor":"30316","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nThe concept of 'homology' is fundamental to the field of comparative biology. In\n1843, Richard Owen defined homology as \"the same organ in different animals\nunder every variety of form and function\". Homology is evaluated strictly in an\nevolutionary context. That is, organs in two species are homologous only if the\nsame structure was present in their last common ancestor. Organs as disparate as\na bat's wing, a seal's flipper, a cat's limb and a human arm have a common\nunderlying anatomy which was present in their last common ancestor and so\ntherefore are homologous as forelimbs. s in mammals provide one example of\nhomology.]] Homologous from Greek Î¿Î¼Î¿Î»Î¿Î³ÎµÎ¹Î½, 'to\nagree' traits of organisms are therefore due to descent from a common\nancestor. The opposite of homologous organs are analogous organs which do\nsimilar jobs in two taxa that were not present in the last common ancestor but\nrather evolved separately. An example of an analogous trait would be the wings\nof bats and birds, which evolved independently in each lineage separately after\ndiverging from an ancestor without wings.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between different hierarchical levels of homology\nin order to make informative biological comparisons. In the above example, the\nbird and bat wings are analogous as wings, but homologous as forelimbs because\nthe organ served as a forearm (not a wing) in the last common ancestor of\ntetrapods. Homology can also be described at the\nlevel of the gene. In genetics homology can refer to both the gene (DNA) and the\ncorresponding protein product.\n","linknr":616,"url":"Homology_(biology)","recorded":1362483444,"links":53,"instances":["arthropod_mouthpart","plant_gene","biology","disambiguation","genetics","database"],"pdf":["http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/19/1/176.full.pdf","http://euplotes.biology.uiowa.edu/web/IBS593/week4/Homologyevolving.pdf","http://euplotes.biology.uiowa.edu/web/IBS593/week4/Homologyevolving.pdf"],"categories":["Evolutionary biology","Phylogenetics","Comparative anatomy"],"headings":["Etymology","Anatomical homology","Homologous structures in other phyla","Homology between genders and forms","Homologies across phyla","Determining homology","Plants","Sequence homology","See also","Notes","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Homology_vertebrates.svg/300px-Homology_vertebrates.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Handskelett_MK1888.png/350px-Handskelett_MK1888.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Homology.jpg/220px-Homology.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Zinc-finger-seq-alignment2.png/500px-Zinc-finger-seq-alignment2.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Crossopterygii_fins_tetrapod_legs.JPG/140px-Crossopterygii_fins_tetrapod_legs.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["analogy","biology"],["analogy","biology"],["analogy","biology"],["mosaic","disambiguation"],["mandible","arthropod_mouthpart"],["flu","plant_gene"],["eggnog","database"],["translation","genetics"]],"members":["mandible","flu","analogy","mosaic","translation","eggnog"],"related":["Comparative_biology","Richard_Owen","Mammal","Ancient_Greek","Organisms","Common_descent","Analogy_(biology)","Convergent_evolution","Bat_wing","Tetrapod","Ray_Lankester","Chiroptera","Bird","Analogy_(biology)","Evolution","Bat","Primate","Embryo","Ovary","Testicle","Analogy_(biology)","Maple","Albatross","Homoplasy","Evolutionary_developmental_biology","Rolf_Sattler","Mosaic_(disambiguation)","Compound_leaf","Flower","Somite","Trilobite","Chelicerata","Uniramia","Uniramia","Crustacean","Chelicerae","Pedipalps","Mandible_(arthropod_mouthpart)","Maxillae","Prostate","Skene's_gland","Penis","Clitoris","Uterus","Bulbourethral_gland","Bartholin's_gland","Stinger","Ovipositor","Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles","Succulents","Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles","Cactus","Primary_structure","Speciation","Gene_duplication","Convergent_evolution","Conserved_sequence","Amino_acid","Gene_fusion","ClustalW","Sequence_clustering","Sequence_alignment","Biological_databases","Genetics","Speciation","Walter_M._Fitch","FLU_(plant_gene)","Gene_duplication","Biological_databases","EggNOG_(database)","OrthoDB","Orthologous_MAtrix","Paralogous","Gene_duplication","Evolution","Translation_(genetics)","Myoglobin","Hemoglobin","Hemoglobin_A","Hemoglobin_A2","Hemoglobin_B","Fetal_hemoglobin","Angiogenin","Ribonuclease","Gene","Susumu_Ohno","Horizontal_gene_transfer","Sex","Cladistics","Deep_homology","List_of_homologues_of_the_human_reproductive_system","OrthoDB","Orthologous_MAtrix","TreeFam","Protein_homology"]}
