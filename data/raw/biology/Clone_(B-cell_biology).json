Nossal, G. J. V. & Lederberg, J. 1958. Antibody production by\nsingle cells. Nature 181:1419-1420 This differentiation and activation of\nthe B cell occurs most rapidly after exposure to antigen by antigen-presenting\ncells in the reticuloendothelial system, and under modulation by T cells, and is\nclosely intertwined with affinity maturation. B cells that respond most avidly\nto antigen are preferentially allowed to proliferate and mature, a process known\nas clonal selection.\n\nIn lymphocytic neoplastic diseases such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, but\nalso other illnesses, there can be a massive expansion of a single B-cell clone,\ndetectable by measuring the excessively-produced antibodies, measured in a serum\nprotein electrophoresis test or peripheral blood flow cytometry. Such an\nexpansion is said to be \"monoclonal\", and monoclonal antibodies produced by such\na group of B cells can cause illnesses such as amyloidosis and lupus, or can be\nindicative of an underlying malignancy. The concept of clonality is closely\nassociated with malignancy, for example in diagnosing lymphomatoid skin\nlesions. The expansion of a particular clone of immune B cells is\nusually interpreted by clinicians as evidence of unrestricted cell growth, the\nhallmark of cancer.\n","linknr":100,"url":"Clone_(B-cell_biology)","recorded":1362569902,"links":11,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lymphocytes"],"headings":["Footnotes"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["B_cell","B_cell","B_cell","Antigen-presenting_cell","Reticuloendothelial_system","T_cell","Affinity_maturation","B_cell","Clonal_selection","Lymphocyte","Neoplasm","Multiple_myeloma","Lymphoma","Serum_protein_electrophoresis","Flow_cytometry","Monoclonal_antibodies","Amyloidosis","Systemic_lupus_erythematosus","Malignancy","Cancer","Skin","B_cell","Cancer"]}
