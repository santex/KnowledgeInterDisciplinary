{"cursor":"5874","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Militarized Interstate Disputes' (or 'MIDs') are conflicts between states that\ndo not involve a full scale war. A conflict is described as an MID if it causes\nfewer than 1000 deaths, and some military force is used. This can be\nnothing more than a military display of force with no deaths. Under this\ndefinition, over 2000 MIDs have been identified since 1816 in the Correlates of\nWar project. Daniel M. Jones, Stuart A. Bremer and J. David Singer. 1996.\n\"Militarized Interstate Disputes, 1816-1992: Rationale, Coding Rules, and\nEmpirical Patterns.\" Conflict Management and Peace Science 15(2): 163-213.\n\nFor example, although the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States-led\ncoalition would be considered a 'war', the bombings and disputes related to\nAmerican, British and (until 1996) French control of the Iraqi no-fly zone in\nthe 1990s is described by Wayman (in the paper referenced below) as an 'MID'.\n \n\nSome of the findings from research on MIDs:\n\n*Research using a continuous measure of democracy shows that the most democratic\nnations have few MIDs with one another. There is an ongoing debate regarding\nwhether it is the most authoritarian or the intermediate regimes that have the\nmost MIDs.\n\n *When examining these MIDs in more detail, the inter-liberal disputes\nhave on the average more hostility, but are less likely to involve third\nparties, hostility is less likely to be reciprocated, when reciprocated the\nresponse is usually proportional to the provocation, and the disputes are less\nlikely to cause any loss of life.  *Enduring militarized competition\nbetween democratic states is rare. After both states have become democratic,\nthere is a decreasing probability for MIDs within a year and this decreases\nalmost to zero within five years.\n* Democracies do sometimes attack nondemocracies. Many earlier papers found that\n  democracies in general are as warlike as nondemocracies, but according to\n  several recent papers democracies are overall slightly less involved in war,\n  initiate wars and MIDs less frequently than nondemocracies, and tend more\n  frequently to seek negotiated resolutions.\n* A recent theory is that democracies can be divided into \"pacifist\" and\n  \"militant\". While both avoid attacking other democracies, \"militant\"\n  democracies have a tendency to distrust and use confrontational policies\n  against dictatorships. Most MIDs by democracies since 1950 have involved\n  only four nations: the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and\n  India. \n","linknr":143,"url":"Militarized_Interstate_Disputes","recorded":1362579525,"links":28,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/WarData_NEW/COW%20Website%20-%20Typology%20of%20war.pdf","http://www.correlatesofwar.org/COW2%20Data/WarData_NEW/COW%20Website%20-%20Typology%20of%20war.pdf","http://www.saramitchell.org/russettoneal04.pdf","http://www.saramitchell.org/russettoneal04.pdf","http://www.nyu.edu/classes/nbeck/q2/toe-resp.pdf","http://www.nyu.edu/classes/nbeck/q2/toe-resp.pdf","http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~phensel/Research/jop00.pdf","http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~phensel/Research/jop00.pdf","http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf","http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf","http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf","http://www.sgir.org/conference2004/papers/Mueller%20Wolff%20-%20Dyadic%20Democratic%20Peace%20Strikes%20Back.pdf"],"categories":["Political science theories","Warfare by type","Military doctrines"],"headings":["References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Society.svg/45px-Society.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/65/Waricon.svg/30px-Waricon.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Sovereign_state","War","Correlates_of_War","2003_War_in_Iraq","United_States_of_America","United_Kingdom","France","Iraqi_no-fly_zone","United_States","United_Kingdom","Israel","India","War","Democratic_Peace_Theory"]}
