Developers are the coordinators of the activities, converting\nideas on paper into real property. Frej, Anne\nB & Peiser, Richard B. Professional Real Estate Development, Second Edition: The\nULI Guide to the Business. Urban Land Institute, 2003. p. 3. Real estate\ndevelopment is different from construction, although many developers also\nconstruct. Developer Louis Lesser drew the distinction in a 1963 New York Times\narticle, \"Developing is the key word. 'We don't build ourselves', Mr. Lesser\nstresses. 'We buy the land, finance the deal, and then we have the best builders\nbuild under bond at a fixed cost.'\" New York Times, March\n16, 1963, \"Personality Boom is Loud for Louis Lesser\"\n\nDevelopers buy land, finance real estate deals, build or have builders build\nprojects, create, imagine, control and orchestrate the process of development\nfrom the beginning to end. Developers usually take the\ngreatest risk in the creation or renovation of real estateâand receive the\ngreatest rewards. Typically, developers purchase a tract of land, determine the\nmarketing of the property, develop the building program and design, obtain the\nnecessary public approval and financing, build the structure, and lease, manage,\nand ultimately sell it. Developers work\nwith many different counterparts along each step of this process, including\narchitects, city planners, engineers, surveyors, inspectors, contractors,\nleasing agents and more. In the Town and Country Planning context of the UK,\n'development' is defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 s55.\n","linknr":278,"url":"Real_estate_development","recorded":1362478799,"links":29,"instances":["entrepreneur","land","business_method","irsa"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Real estate and property developers|","Real estate|","Top lists"],"headings":["Statutory definition of development in the United Kingdom","Paths for entering the development field","Organizing for development","Land development","Notable developers","Top real estate development companies by market capitalization","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/RasBeyrouth.jpg/245px-RasBeyrouth.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Netherlands%2C_The_Hague%2C_Boekelermeerstraat.JPG/245px-Netherlands%2C_The_Hague%2C_Boekelermeerstraat.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg/48px-Ambox_globe_content.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subdivision","land"],["spatial_intelligence","business_method"],["steve_wynn","entrepreneur"],["inversiones_y_representaciones_sociedad_anónima","irsa"]],"members":["steve_wynn","subdivision","spatial_intelligence","inversiones_y_representaciones_sociedad_anónima"],"related":["Beirut","Business","Renovation","Lease","Building","Real_Estate","Property","Construction","Louis_Lesser","Risk","Marketing","Town_and_Country_Planning","Master_of_Real_Estate_Development","Master_of_Science_in_Real_Estate","MBA","Environmental_consulting","Geotechnical_engineering","Environmental_impact_assessment","Subdivision_(land)","Spatial_intelligence_(business_method)","Paul_Allen","Microsoft","Bellway","Bluegreen_Communities","Candy_&_Candy","Cheung_Kong_Group","Bahria_Town","Barbara_Corcoran","Trammell_Crow","Delfin_Lend_Lease","DLF_Universal","Louis_Dubin","Emaar_Properties","Charles_E._Fraser","Harry_Helmsley","Leona_Helmsley","Hang_Lung_Properties","Gerald_D._Hines","Inversiones_y_Representaciones_S.A.","The_Irvine_Company","Donald_Bren","KB_Homes","Louis_Lesser","William_Levitt","Maharishi_Heaven_on_Earth_Development","McCormack_Baron_Salazar","Mirvac","Olympia_and_York","Charles_V._Paterno","Jorge_M._Perez","John_Portman","The_Related_Companies","Forest_City_Enterprises","James_Rouse","Ryan_Companies_US,_Inc.","Sino_Group","Alan_Sugar","Solidere","Jerry_Speyer","Sun_Hung_Kai_Properties","Swire_Properties","Robert_Tishman","Harry_Triguboff","Steve_Wynn_(entrepreneur)","Donald_Trump","Alfred_Taubman","John_Vartan","Vanke","Imperio_Properties","Market_capitalization","DLF_Universal","Inversiones_y_Representaciones_Sociedad_Anónima_(IRSA)","Consolidated-Tomoka_Land","AMREP","Stratus_Properties","Bluegreen","ZipRealty","Louis_Lesser","Louis_Lesser_Enterprises,_Inc."]}
