After absorbing\nenergy, an electron may jump from the ground state to a higher energy excited\nstate.]] The 'ground state' of a quantum mechanical system is its lowest-energy\nstate; the energy of the ground state is known as the zero-point energy of the\nsystem. An excited state is any state with energy greater than the ground state.\nThe ground state of a quantum field theory is usually called the vacuum state or\nthe vacuum.\n\nIf more than one ground state exists, they are said to be degenerate. Many\nsystems have degenerate ground states. It turns out that degeneracy occurs\nwhenever a nontrivial unitary operator commutes with the Hamiltonian of\nthe system.\n\nAccording to the third law of thermodynamics, a system at absolute zero\ntemperature exists in its ground state; thus, its entropy is determined by the\ndegeneracy of the ground state. Many systems, such as a perfect crystal lattice,\nhave a unique ground state and therefore have zero entropy at absolute zero. It\nis also possible for the highest excited state to have absolute zero temperature\nfor systems that exhibit negative temperature.\n","linknr":138,"url":"Ground_state","recorded":1362477512,"links":27,"instances":["quantum_mechanics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Quantum mechanics"],"headings":["Examples","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Energylevels.png/220px-Energylevels.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Particle_in_a_box_wavefunctions_2.svg/170px-Particle_in_a_box_wavefunctions_2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/5/e/35e6ffb2fa51e9b80c01c5ddafbf18a3.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hamiltonian","quantum_mechanics"]],"members":["hamiltonian"],"related":["Electron","Atom","Excited_state","Energy","Atomic_electron_transition","Quantum_mechanics","Energy","Stationary_state","Zero-point_energy","Excited_state","Quantum_field_theory","Vacuum_state","Degenerate_energy_level","Nontrivial","Unitary_operator","Commutator","Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)","Third_law_of_thermodynamics","Absolute_zero","Temperature","Entropy","Crystal_lattice","Absolute_zero","Temperature","Negative_temperature","Wave_function","Particle_in_a_box","Sine_wave","Planck_constant","Atomic_nucleus","Exponential_distribution","Electron","Bohr_radius","Atomic_orbital","Ionization_energy","Bound_state","Second","Time"]}
