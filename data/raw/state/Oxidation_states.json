{"cursor":"17611","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn chemistry, the 'oxidation state' is an indicator of the degree of oxidation\nof an atom in a chemical compound. The formal oxidation state is the\nhypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different\nelements were 100% ionic. Oxidation states are typically represented by\nintegers, which can be positive, negative, or zero. In some cases, the average\noxidation state of an element is a fraction, such as 8/3 for iron in magnetite\n(). The highest known oxidation state is +8 in the tetroxides of ruthenium,\nxenon, osmium, iridium, and hassium, and some complexes involving plutonium,\nwhile the lowest known oxidation state is −4 for some elements in the\ncarbon group.\n\nThe increase in oxidation state of an atom through a chemical reaction is known\nas an oxidation; a decrease in oxidation state is known as a reduction. Such\nreactions involve the formal transfer of electrons, a net gain in electrons\nbeing a reduction and a net loss of electrons being an oxidation. For pure\nelements, the oxidation state is zero.\n\nThe definition of the oxidation state listed by IUPAC is as follows: IUPAC [[Gold Book]] definition:\n[http://goldbook.iupac.org/O04365.html oxidation state]\n [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/O04365.pdf PDF] {{quote|'Oxidation\nstate:' A measure of the degree of oxidation of an atom in a substance. It is\ndefined as the charge an atom might be imagined to have when electrons are\ncounted according to an agreed-upon set of rules: *(1) the oxidation state of a\nfree element (uncombined element) is zero *(2) for a simple (monoatomic) ion,\nthe oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion *(3) hydrogen has an\noxidation state of 1 and oxygen has an oxidation state of −2 when they are\npresent in most compounds. (Exceptions to this are that hydrogen has an\noxidation state of −1 in hydrides of active metals, e.g. LiH, and oxygen\nhas an oxidation state of −1 in peroxides, e.g. H 2O 2\n*(4) the algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule\nmust be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the\nconstituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion.\n\nFor example, the oxidation states of sulfur in are, respectively: −2, 0,\n+4, +6 and +6. The higher the oxidation state of a given atom the greater its\ndegree of oxidation; the lower the oxidation state the greater its degree of\nreduction.}}\n","linknr":618,"url":"Oxidation_states","recorded":1362512992,"links":56,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/O04365.pdf"],"categories":["Chemical properties"],"headings":["Some general rules for determining oxidation states without use of Lewis structures","Calculation of formal oxidation states with a Lewis structure","Elements with multiple oxidation states","Oxidation number","History","Unusual formal oxidation states","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Acetic_acid_structures4.png/400px-Acetic_acid_structures4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Thiosulfate-ion-2D-dimensions.png/150px-Thiosulfate-ion-2D-dimensions.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Redox_Tollens_Oxidationszahlen_C.svg/600px-Redox_Tollens_Oxidationszahlen_C.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["resonance","chemistry"],["valence","chemistry"]],"members":["valence","resonance"],"related":["Chemistry","Oxidation","Atom","Chemical_compound","Electrical_charge","Ionic_bond","Integers","Magnetite","Ruthenium_tetroxide","Xenon_tetroxide","Osmium_tetroxide","Iridium","Hassium","Plutonium","Carbon_group","Redox","IUPAC","IUPAC","Free_element","Hydrides","Lithium_hydride","Peroxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","Sulfite","Molecule","Fluorine","Electronegativity","Halogen","Chlorine_monofluoride","Hydrogen","Oxidation","Sodium","Aluminium","Boron","Sodium_hydride","Sodium_borohydride","Lithium_aluminium_hydride","Oxygen","Peroxides","Alkali_metal","Alkalide","Alkaline_earth_metal","Hydroxide","Formal_charge","Protonation","Lewis_structure","Lewis_structure","Ionization_energy","Partial_charge","Lewis_structure","Valence_electron","Electronegative","Lone_pair","Acetic_acid","Methyl","Carbon-carbon_bond","Group_14","Carboxylic_acid","Thiosulfate","Redox","Acetaldehyde","Tollens'_reagent","Silver","Formal_charge","Methane","Ethane","Chloromethane","Acetylene","Dichloromethane","1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane","Chloroform","Hexachloroethane","Carbon_tetrachloride","Cyclopentadienyl_complex","Tropylium","Uranocene","Oxide","Zinc_oxide","Carbon_dioxide","Water","Peroxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","Superoxide","Potassium_superoxide","Ozonide","Rubidium_ozonide","Oxygen","Dioxygenyl","Dioxygen_difluoride","Oxygen_difluoride","Superoxide","Resonance_(chemistry)","Cyclopentadienyl","Magnetite","Ozonide","Coordination_chemistry","Ligand","W._M._Latimer","Antoine_Lavoisier","Oxygen","J._Chem._Educ.","List_of_oxidation_states_of_the_elements","Electrochemistry","Oxidation_number","Valence_(chemistry)"]}
