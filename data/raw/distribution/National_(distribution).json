{"cursor":"2097","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'National' is an adjective (adverb form: nationally) used to describe a product\nor publication that is distributed throughout an entire nation, e.g., a national\nmagazine. It implies that the item is available for purchase or access anywhere\nin the country. Comparatively, some products or publications are described as\n\"local\" or \"regional\", and are distributed only locally or regionally.\n\nExamples: *[[Newsweek]] is a national (U.S.) magazine; [[Minnesota Monthly]] is\na regional magazine. *[[USA Today]] is a national (U.S.) newspaper; [[The Queens\nChronicle]] is a local newspaper. *Post Raisin Bran is a breakfast cereal that\nis distributed nationally in the United States, and can be purchased almost\nanywhere; Quisp is in limited distribution, and cannot be found in many areas. http://www.quakeroats.com/products/more-products-from-\nquaker/content/cereals/quisp.aspx\n\nThe practice of national distribution is tied closely to that of national\nbranding; the two are associated with marketing.\n\nInternet commerce has enabled many regional or local products to be sold and\nmarketed nationwide.\n\nThe use of the word national with respect to distribution should not be confused\nwith another sense of meaning of that word, which is having to do with a nation\nor associated with the character of a nation. For example, in the United States\nthe hamburger or hot dog is often described as a national dish, and baseball as\na national sport. This use of the term is used to identify the thing with the\ncharacter or trademark of the country itself, and is sometimes associated with\nnationalism.\n","linknr":137,"url":"National_(distribution)","recorded":1362666070,"links":20,"instances":["business","disambiguation","business"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Distribution, retailing, and wholesaling"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Edit-copy_purple-wikit.svg/40px-Edit-copy_purple-wikit.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Linguistics_stub.svg/40px-Linguistics_stub.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Business_template.svg/30px-Business_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["product","business"],["distribution","business"],["national","brand"],["national","disambiguation"]],"members":["product","national","distribution"],"related":["Product_(business)","Publication","Distribution_(business)","Nation","Country","Regional","United_States","Magazine","Newspaper","Local_newspaper","Post_Holdings","Raisin_Bran","Quisp","National_(brand)","Brand","Marketing","Electronic_commerce","United_States","Hamburger","Hot_dog","National_dish","Baseball","National_sport","Trademark","Nationalism","National_(disambiguation)"]}
