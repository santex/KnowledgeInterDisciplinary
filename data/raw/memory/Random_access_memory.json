{"cursor":"16936","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n{{multiple issues|\n\n\n\n}}\n\n volatile random-access memory: Synchronous Dynamic RAM modules, primarily used\n as main memory in personal computers, workstations, and servers.]]\n\n'Random-access memory' ('RAM') is a form of computer data storage. A random-\naccess device allows stored data to be accessed quickly in any random order. In\ncontrast, other data storage media such as hard disks, CDs, DVDs and magnetic\ntape, as well as early primary memory types such as drum memory, read and write\ndata only in a predetermined order, consecutively, because of mechanical design\nlimitations. Therefore the time to access a given data location varies\nsignificantly depending on its physical location.\n\nToday, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuits. Strictly\nspeaking, modern types of DRAM are not random access, as data is read in bursts,\nalthough the name DRAM / RAM has stuck. However, many types of SRAM, ROM, OTP,\nand NOR flash are still random access even in a strict sense. RAM is often\nassociated with volatile types of memory (such as DRAM memory modules), where\nits stored information is lost if the power is removed. Many other types of non-\nvolatile memory are RAM as well, including most types of ROM and a type of flash\nmemory called [[flash memory#NOR flash|NOR-Flash]]. The first RAM modules to\ncome into the market were created in 1951 and were sold until the late 1960s and\nearly 1970s.\n","linknr":461,"url":"Random_access_memory","recorded":1362675519,"links":116,"instances":["electronics","engineering","computer_science","computing","computer_science","electronics"],"pdf":["http://epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/pub/Home/TrendsAndConceptsII2010/HW_Trends_borkar_2015.pdf","http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/trips/publications/isca00.pdf","http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf","http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf"],"categories":["Computer memory","American inventions"],"headings":["History","Types of RAM","Memory hierarchy","Other uses of RAM","Recent developments","Memory wall","See also","Notes and references","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Gnome_globe_current_event.svg/42px-Gnome_globe_current_event.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Memory_module_DDRAM_20-03-2006.jpg/220px-Memory_module_DDRAM_20-03-2006.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1989-0406-022%2C_VEB_Carl_Zeiss_Jena%2C_1-Megabit-Chip.jpg/220px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1989-0406-022%2C_VEB_Carl_Zeiss_Jena%2C_1-Megabit-Chip.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/RamTypes.JPG/220px-RamTypes.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg/28px-Computer-aj_aj_ashton_01.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Telecom-icon.svg/28px-Telecom-icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["server","computing"],["flip-flop","electronics"],["persistence","computer_science"],["thrashing","computer_science"],["bottleneck","engineering"],["leakage","electronics"]],"members":["leakage","bottleneck","thrashing","server","persistence"],"related":["Volatile_memory","Dynamic_RAM","DIMM","Personal_computers","Workstation","Server_(computing)","Computer_data_storage","Data","Hard_disk","Compact_Disc","DVD","Magnetic_tape","Drum_memory","Integrated_circuit","DRAM","DRAM","Static_random_access_memory","Read-only_memory","Programmable_read-only_memory","NOR_flash","Random_access","Volatile_memory","DRAM","DIMM","Read_only_memory","Flash_memory","Relay","Delay_line_memory","Drum_memory","Vacuum_tube","Triode","Transistor","Williams_tube","Cathode_ray_tube","Magnetic-core_memory","Robert_H._Dennard","Dynamic_random-access_memory","Read-only_memory","Diode_matrix","Address_decoder","Core_rope_memory","Static_random_access_memory","Dynamic_random-access_memory","Phase-change_memory","Bit","Flip-flop_(electronics)","Central_processing_unit","Read-only_memory","EEPROM","Flash_memory","Persistence_(computer_science)","Universal_serial_bus","Disk_storage","Magnetic_tape_data_storage","Netbooks","Rugged_computers","ECC_memory","Parity_bit","DVD-RAM","CD-RW","DVD-RW","CPU_register","Static_random_access_memory","CPU_cache","DRAM","Paging","Virtual_memory","Swap_space","Access_time","Memory_rank","Interleave","Storage_media","DIMM","CPU","Integrated_circuit","Motherboard","CD-ROM","Hard_drive","Paging","Thrashing_(computer_science)","RAM_disk","Embedded_systems","BIOS","Operating_system","NVRAM","Carbon_nanotube","Magnetic_tunnel_effect","Kibibyte","MRAM","Infineon_Technologies","Mebibyte","Thermal_Assisted_Switching","Crocus_Technology","Spin_Torque_Transfer","Crocus_Technology","Hynix","IBM","Nantero","Gibibyte","Solid-state_drive","Server_farm","Low-power_electronics","Central_processing_unit","Bottleneck_(engineering)","Intel_Corporation","Leakage_(electronics)","Resistance-capacitance","Core_2_Duo","Pentium_4","CAS_latency","Dual-channel_architecture","Triple-channel_architecture","Registered_memory","RAM_parity","Memory_Geometry"]}
