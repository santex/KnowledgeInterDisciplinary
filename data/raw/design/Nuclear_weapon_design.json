While photographs of weapon\ncasings are common, photographs of the physics package are quite rare, even\nfor the oldest and crudest nuclear weapons. For a photograph of a modern\nphysics package see W80. of a nuclear weapon to detonate. There are four\nbasic design types. In all except the last, the explosive energy of deployed\ndevices is derived primarily from nuclear fission, not fusion. *'Pure fission\nweapons' were the first nuclear weapons built and have so far been the only\ntype ever used in warfare. The active material is fissile uranium (uranium\nwith a high percentage of U-235) or plutonium (Pu-239), explosively assembled\ninto a chain-reacting critical mass by one of two methods: **'[[Gun-type\nfission weapon|Gun assembly]]': one piece of fissile uranium is fired at a\nfissile uranium target at the end of the weapon, similar to firing a bullet\ndown a gun barrel, achieving critical mass when combined. **'[[Implosion\n(mechanical process)|Implosion]]': a fissile mass of either material (U-235,\nPu-239, or a combination) is surrounded by high explosives that compress the\nmass, resulting in criticality. :The implosion method can use either uranium\nor plutonium as fuel. The gun method only uses uranium. Plutonium is\nconsidered impractical for the gun method because of early triggering due to\nPu-240 contamination and due to its time constant for prompt critical fission\nbeing much shorter than that of U-235.\n\n*'[[Boosted fission weapon]]s' improve on the implosion design. The high\npressure and temperature environment at the center of an exploding fission\nweapon compresses and heats a mixture of tritium and deuterium gas (heavy\nisotopes of hydrogen). The hydrogen fuses to form helium and free neutrons. The\nenergy release from this fusion reaction is relatively negligible, but each\nneutron starts a new fission chain reaction, speeding up the fission and greatly\nreducing the amount of fissile material that would otherwise be wasted when\nexpansion of the fissile material stops the chain reaction. Boosting can more\nthan double the weapon's fission energy release.\n\n*'[[Thermonuclear weapon|Two-stage thermonuclear weapons]]' are essentially a\nchain of fusion-boosted fission weapons, usually with only two stages in the\nchain. The secondary stage is imploded by x-ray energy from the first stage,\ncalled the \"primary.\" This radiation implosion is much more effective than the\nhigh-explosive implosion of the primary. Consequently, the secondary can be many\ntimes more powerful than the primary, without being bigger. The secondary can be\ndesigned to maximize fusion energy release, but in most designs fusion is\nemployed only to drive or enhance fission, as it is in the primary. More stages\ncould be added, but the result would be a multi-megaton weapon too powerful to\nserve any plausible purpose. {{Citation |last = Life Editors |year = 1961\n|title = To the Outside World, a Superbomb more Bluff than Bang |periodical =\nLife |publication-place = New York |issue = Vol. 51, No. 19, November 10, 1961\n|url =\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=4VMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|pages = 34â37 |accessdate = 2010-06-28}}. Article on the Soviet Tsar Bomba\ntest. Because explosions are spherical in shape and targets are spread out on\nthe relatively flat surface of the earth, numerous smaller weapons cause more\ndestruction. From page 35: \". . .five five-megaton weapons would demolish a\ngreater area than a single 50-megatonner.\" (The United States briefly\ndeployed a three-stage 25-megaton bomb, the B41, starting in 1961. Also in 1961,\nthe Soviet Union tested, but did not deploy, a three-stage 50â100 megaton\ndevice, Tsar Bomba.)\n\n*'[[Pure fusion weapon]]s' have not been invented. Such weapons, though, would\nproduce far less radioactive fallout than current designs, although they would\nrelease huge amounts of neutrons.\n\nPure fission weapons historically have been the first type to be built by a\nnation state. Large industrial states with well-developed nuclear arsenals have\ntwo-stage thermonuclear weapons, which are the most compact, scalable, and cost\neffective option once the necessary industrial infrastructure is built.\n\nMost known innovations in nuclear weapon design originated in the United States,\nalthough some were later developed independently by other states; The United\nStates and the Soviet Union were the only nations to build large nuclear\narsenals with every possible type of nuclear weapon. The U.S. had a four-year\nhead start and was the first to produce fissile material and fission weapons,\nall in 1945. The only Soviet claim for a design first was the Joe 4 detonation\non August 12, 1953, said to be the first deliverable hydrogen bomb. However, as\nHerbert York first revealed in The Advisors: Oppenheimer, Teller and the\nSuperbomb (W.H. Freeman, 1976), it was not a true hydrogen bomb (it was a\nboosted fission weapon of the Sloika/Alarm Clock type, not a two-stage\nthermonuclear). Soviet dates for the essential elements of warhead\nminiaturization â boosted, hollow-pit, two-point, air lens primaries â are not\navailable in the open literature, but the larger size of Soviet ballistic\nmissiles is often explained as evidence of an initial Soviet difficulty in\nminiaturizing warheads. the following descriptions feature U.S. designs.\n\nIn early news accounts, pure fission weapons were called atomic bombs or A-\nbombs, a misnomer since the energy comes only from the nucleus of the atom.\nWeapons involving fusion were called hydrogen bombs or H-bombs, also a misnomer\nsince their destructive energy comes mostly from fission. Insiders favored the\nterms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.\n\nThe term thermonuclear refers to the high temperatures required to initiate\nfusion. It ignores the equally important factor of pressure, which was\nconsidered secret at the time the term became current. Many nuclear weapon terms\nare similarly inaccurate because of their origin in a classified environment.\n","linknr":1058,"url":"Nuclear_weapon_design","recorded":1362479235,"links":60,"instances":["engineering","nuclear_explosive","chemistry","nuclear","rocket_family","nuclear_test","heu","bearing","nuclear_warhead","detonator","nuclear_device","novel","magazine"],"pdf":["http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/cardozo.pdf","http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32929.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/4_3harvey.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear
