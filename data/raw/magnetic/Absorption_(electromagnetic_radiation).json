A white beam [[light\n source|source]] â emitting light of multiple [[wavelength]]s â is focused on a\n sample (the [[complementary color]]s pairs are indicated by the yellow dotted\n lines). Upon striking the sample, [[photons]] that match the energy gap of the\n [[molecule]]s present (green light in this example) areabsorbed'' in order to\n excite the molecule. Other photons transmits unaffected and, if the radiation\n is in the visible region (400-700nm), the transmitted light appears as its\n complementary color. By comparing the attenuation of the transmitted light with\n the incident, an absorption spectra can be obtained.]]\n\nIn physics, 'absorption' of electromagnetic radiation is the way in which the\nenergy of a photon is taken up by matter, typically the electrons of an atom.\nThus, the electromagnetic energy is transformed to other forms of energy for\nexample, to heat. The absorption of light during wave propagation\nis often called attenuation. Usually, the absorption of waves does not depend\non their intensity (linear absorption), although in certain conditions\n(usually, in optics), the medium changes its transparency dependently on the\nintensity of waves going through, and the saturable absorption (or nonlinear\nabsorption) occurs.\n","linknr":199,"url":"Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)","recorded":1362371826,"links":29,"instances":["astronomy","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scattering, absorption and radiative transfer (optics)","Electromagnetic radiation","Glass physics","Radiation"],"headings":["Quantifying absorption","Measuring absorption","Applications","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Spectroscopy_overview.svg/440px-Spectroscopy_overview.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg/220px-Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["extinction","astronomy"],["reflection","physics"]],"members":["extinction","reflection"],"related":["Attenuation","Absorption_spectroscopy","Physics","Electromagnetic_radiation","Energy","Photon","Electrons","Atom","Radiant_energy","Heat","Wave_propagation","Attenuation","Optics","Saturable_absorption","Attenuation_coefficient","Molar_absorptivity","Beer–Lambert_law","Mass_attenuation_coefficient","Mass_attenuation_coefficient","Absorption_cross_section","Scattering_cross-section","Extinction_(astronomy)","Penetration_depth","Skin_effect","Propagation_constant","Wavenumber","Refractive_index","Relative_permittivity","Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity","Absorbance","Optical_depth","Absorbance","Reflection_(physics)","Refraction","Beer–Lambert_law","Absorption_spectroscopy","Ultraviolet–visible_spectroscopy","Infrared_spectroscopy","X-ray_absorption_spectroscopy","Visible_light","Meteorology","Climatology","Atmospheric_gases","Greenhouse_effect","Albedo","Medicine","X-rays","Bone","Projectional_radiography","Computation_of_radiowave_attenuation_in_the_atmosphere","Chemistry","Materials_science","Optics","Biology","Chloroplast","Light","Chemical_energy","Hydroxyl_ion_absorption","Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water","Photosynthesis","Ultraviolet-visible_spectroscopy","Solar_cell","Albedo","Spectral_line","Absorption_spectroscopy"]}
