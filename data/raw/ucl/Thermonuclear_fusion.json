{"cursor":"6958","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Thermonuclear fusion' is a way to achieve nuclear fusion by using extremely\nhigh temperatures.\n\nTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, so by\nheating the material it will gain energy. After reaching sufficient\ntemperature, given by the Lawson criterion, the energy of accidental collisions\nwithin the plasma is high enough to overcome the Coulomb barrier and the\nparticles may fuse together.\n\nIn a Deuterium - tritium fusion reaction, for example, the energy necessary to\novercome the Coulomb barrier is 0.1 MeV. Converting the units between\nelectronvolts and kelvin shows that the barrier would be overcome at a\ntemperature in excess of 120 million kelvins.\n\nThere are two effects that lower the actual temperature needed. One is the fact\nthat temperature is the average kinetic energy, implying that some nuclei at\nthis temperature would actually have much higher energy than 0.1 MeV, while\nothers would be much lower. It is the nuclei in the high-energy tail of the\nvelocity distribution that account for most of the fusion reactions. The other\neffect is quantum tunneling. The nuclei do not actually have to have enough\nenergy to overcome the Coulomb barrier completely. If they have nearly enough\nenergy, they can tunnel through the remaining barrier. For these reasons fuel at\nlower temperatures will still undergo fusion events, at a lower rate.\n\nThermonuclear fusion is the physical principle underlying fusion power.\n","linknr":147,"url":"Thermonuclear_fusion","recorded":1362665467,"links":15,"instances":["physics"],"pdf":["http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/images4/PCT-PAGES/2006/102006/06024137/06024137.pdf","http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700009349_1970009349.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADP000254&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear fusion"],"headings":["Confinement","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"]],"members":["plasma"],"related":["Nuclear_fusion","Kinetic_energy","Lawson_criterion","Plasma_(physics)","Coulomb_barrier","Nuclear_fusion_reaction","Temperature","Distribution_function","Quantum_tunneling","Fusion_power","Vacuum","Inertia","Lawson_criterion","Gravity","Star","Red_dwarf","Brown_dwarf","Deuterium","Lithium","Asymptotic_giant_branch","Triple-alpha_process","Silicon_burning_process","Endothermic","R-process","S-process","Exothermic","Nuclear_fission","Nucleosynthesis","Magnetic_field","Tokamak","Stellarator","Magnetic_mirror","Hydrogen_bomb","X-rays","Laser","Ion","Electron","Z-pinch","Explosive_material","Neutron","Deuterium","Oxygen","Voitenko_compressor","Deuterium","Thermonuclear_weapon"]}
