{"cursor":"12246","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, 'Euclidean space' is the Euclidean plane, the three-dimensional\nspace of Euclidean geometry, and generalizations of these ideas to higher\ndimensions. The term âEuclideanâ distinguishes these spaces from the curved\nspaces of non-Euclidean geometry and Einstein's general theory of relativity. It\nis named for the Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria.\n\nClassical Greek geometry defined the Euclidean plane and Euclidean three-\ndimensional space using certain postulates, while the other properties of these\nspaces were deduced as theorems. In modern mathematics, it is more common to\ndefine Euclidean space using Cartesian coordinates and the ideas of analytic\ngeometry. This approach brings the tools of algebra and calculus to bear on\nquestions of geometry, and has the advantage that it generalizes easily to\nEuclidean spaces of more than three dimensions.\n\nFrom the modern viewpoint, there is essentially only one Euclidean space of each\ndimension. In dimension one this is the real line; in dimension two it is the\nCartesian plane; and in higher dimensions it is a coordinate space with three or\nmore real number coordinates â in short, an n-dimensional 'real coordinate\nspace'. A point in Euclidean space may be identified by a tuple of real numbers,\nand distances are defined using the Euclidean distance formula. Mathematicians\noften denote the ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space by \\mathbb{R}^n ,\nor sometimes \\mathbb{E}^n if they wish to emphasize its Euclidean\nnature. Euclidean spaces have finite dimension.\n","linknr":255,"url":"Euclidean_space","recorded":1362477235,"links":52,"instances":["geometry","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","geometry","linear_algebra","geometry","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Euclidean geometry","Linear algebra","Topological spaces","Norms (mathematics)"],"headings":["Intuitive overview","Real coordinate space","Euclidean structure","Topology of Euclidean space","Generalizations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Coord_system_CA_0.svg/250px-Coord_system_CA_0.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/0/c/30c28f76ef7517dbd19df4d4c683dbe6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/7/36757438e2c2aa7acb9d9d30124b4550.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/0/f/40f3f87309ba435315d170c05a4d984c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/d/2/4d205f363009661add8470de7cfe9b31.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/a/0/da0facc6150ba8d8125515d3cdbd2c62.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/7/0/d7091ec429cf4d5c33d45cbb555544cf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/9/b/39b8192f59ee670b2df9b66467c0bf1d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/5/235b77c31e62bbf4777bcb5a919e9986.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/8/48847990ebc51c99cf6e677bbb54d5a7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/5/e/f5ec784420564a938a3ec58255ce193c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/c/4fc2a2af1905d2953791127042233743.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/4/b/14b566ae6e1a47adad9180f6f95a9f10.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/0/0/5001854475feebf016957548aaa19857.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["point","geometry"],["set","mathematics"],["point","geometry"],["translation","geometry"],["congruence","geometry"],["reflection","mathematics"],["origin","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["basis","linear_algebra"],["norm","mathematics"],["metric","mathematics"],["orientation","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"]],"members":["congruence","orientation","metric","origin","matrix","reflection","norm","point","basis","translation","set","field"],"related":["Mathematics","Euclidean_plane","Three-dimensional_space","Euclidean_geometry","Higher_dimension","Curved_space","Non-Euclidean_geometry","Albert_Einstein","General_relativity","Greeks","Euclid","Axiom","Theorem","Cartesian_coordinates","Analytic_geometry","Algebra","Calculus","Dimension","Real_line","Cartesian_plane","Coordinate_space","Real_number","Point_(geometry)","Tuple","Euclidean_distance","N-dimensional_space","Set_(mathematics)","Point_(geometry)","Translation_(geometry)","Rotation","Subset","Congruence_(geometry)","Reflection_(mathematics)","Euclidean_group","Real_number","Vector_space","Inner_product","Coordinate_vector","Addition","Affine_space","Group_action","Canonical_form","Origin_(mathematics)","Field_(mathematics)","Real_number","Integer","Tuple","Standard_basis","Isomorphic","Canonical_form","Basis_(linear_algebra)","Dot_product","Norm_(mathematics)","Arccosine","Metric_(mathematics)","Pythagorean_theorem","Inner_product_space","Hilbert_space","Normed_vector_space","Metric_space","Orientation_(mathematics)","Linear_transformation","Matrix_(mathematics)","Special_orthogonal_matrix","Metric_space","Topological_space","Natural_topology","Open_set","If_and_only_if","Open_ball","Product_topology","Real_line","L._E._J._Brouwer","Invariance_of_domain","Subspace_topology","Homeomorphic","Smooth_manifold","Hausdorff_space","Diffeomorphic","Tangent_space","Riemannian_manifold","Curvature","Pseudo-Euclidean_space","Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold","Theory_of_relativity","Spacetime","Matter","Minkowski_space","Gravity","Astronomy","Cosmology","Global_positioning","Airplane","Navigation","Riemannian_geometry","Euclidean_subspace","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Polar_coordinate_system","Hilbert_space"]}
