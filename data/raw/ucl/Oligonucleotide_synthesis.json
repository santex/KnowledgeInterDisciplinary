{"cursor":"73693","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Oligonucleotide synthesis' is the chemical synthesis of relatively short\nfragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The\ntechnique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice because it provides\na rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides of the desired\nsequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA in a 5' to 3' direction,\nchemical oligonucleotide synthesis is carried out in the opposite, 3' to 5'\ndirection. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using\nphosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from\nprotected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and\nU), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA.\n\nTo obtain the desired oligonucleotide, the building blocks are sequentially\ncoupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the\nsequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully\nautomated since the late 1970s. Upon the completion of the chain assembly, the\nproduct is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and\ncollected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length\nof synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the\nnumber of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being\nsynthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high\npurity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA\nmolecules around 15â25 bases in length.\n\nOligonucleotides find a variety of applications in molecular biology and\nmedicine. They are most commonly used as antisense oligonucleotides, small\ninterfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and amplification, probes for\ndetecting complementary DNA or RNA via molecular hybridization, tools for the\ntargeted introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis\nof artificial genes.\n","linknr":883,"url":"Oligonucleotide_synthesis","recorded":1362671996,"links":39,"instances":["rpc","molecular_biology","unit","chemistry","fluorescence"],"pdf":["http://www.glenresearch.com/GlenReports/GR18-1SUPP.pdf","http://www.glenresearch.com/GlenReports/GR18-1SUPP.pdf","http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/24/15/3115.pdf","http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/24/15/3115.pdf"],"categories":["Molecular
