Also termed nitrogenous bases or simply\nbases, their ability to form base-pairs and to stack upon one another lead\ndirectly to the helical structure of DNA and RNA.\n\nUse of the word base is historical, in reference to the chemical properties of\nnucleobases in acid-base reactions within the test tube, and is not especially\nrelevant or important for understanding most of their biological functions.\n\nThe primary nucleobases are cytosine, guanine, adenine (DNA and RNA), thymine\n(DNA) and uracil (RNA), abbreviated as C, G, A, T, and U, respectively. They are\nusually simply called bases in genetics. Because A, G, C, and T appear in the\nDNA, these molecules are called DNA-bases; A, G, C, and U are called RNA-bases.\nUracil replaces thymine in RNA. These two bases are identical except that uracil\nlacks the 5' methyl group. Adenine and guanine belong to the double-ringed class\nof molecules called purines (abbreviated as R). Cytosine, thymine, and uracil\nare all pyrimidines (abbreviated as Y).\n\nIn normal spiral DNA the bases form pairs between the two strands: A with T and\nC with G. Purines pair with pyrimidines mainly for dimensional reasons - only\nthis combination fits the constant width geometry of the DNA spiral. The A-T and\nC-G pairings are required to match the hydrogen bonds between the amine and\ncarbonyl groups on the complementary bases.\n\nThe compound formed when a nucleobase forms a glycosidic bond with the 1'\nanomeric carbon of a ribose or deoxyribose is called a [[nucleoside]], and a\nnucleoside with one or more phosphate groups attached at the 5' carbon is called\na [[nucleotide]].\n\nApart from adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) and uracil (U),\nDNA and RNA also contain bases that have been modified after the nucleic acid\nchain has been formed. In DNA, the most common modified base is 5-methylcytosine\n(m 5C). In RNA, there are many modified bases, including those\ncontained in the nucleosides pseudouridine (Î¨), dihydrouridine (D), inosine (I),\nand 7-methylguanosine (m 7G).

Hypoxanthine is produced from adenine, xanthine from\nguanine.
