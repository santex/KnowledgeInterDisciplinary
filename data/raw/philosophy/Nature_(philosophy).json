{"cursor":"31277","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Nature is a concept with two major sets of inter-related meanings, referring on\nthe one hand to the things which are natural, or subject to the normal working\nof \"laws of nature\", or on the other hand to the essential properties and causes\nof those things to be what they naturally are, or in other words the laws of\nnature themselves.\n\nHow to understand the meaning and significance of nature has been a consistent\ntheme of discussion within the history of Western Civilization, in the\nphilosophical fields of metaphysics and epistemology, as well as in theology and\nscience. The study of natural things and the regular laws which seem to govern\nthem, as opposed to discussion about what it means to be natural, is the area of\nnatural science.\n\nThe word \"nature\" derives from Latin [[wikt:natura#Latin|nÄtÅ«ra]], a\nphilosophical term derived from the verb for birth, which was used as a\ntranslation for the earlier Ancient Greek term [[wikt:ÏÏÏÎ¹Ï|phusis]] which was\nderived from the verb for natural growth, for example that of a plant. Already\nin classical times, philosophical use of these words combined two related\nmeanings which have in common that they refer to the way in which things happen\nby themselves, \"naturally\", without \"interference\" from human deliberation,\ndivine intervention, or anything outside of what is considered normal for the\nnatural things being considered.\n\nUnderstandings of nature depend on the subject and age of the work where they\nappear. For example Aristotle's explanation of natural properties differs from\nwhat is meant by natural properties in modern philosophical and scientific\nworks, which can also differ from other scientific and conventional usage.\n","linknr":538,"url":"Nature_(philosophy)","recorded":1362483094,"links":21,"instances":["philosophy","physics","chinese_philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Philosophy of science"],"headings":["Classical nature and Aristotelian metaphysics","Modern science and laws of nature: trying to avoid metaphysics","\"Late modern\" nature","The survival of metaphysics","The study of nature without metaphysics","Eastern civilization and the philosophical question of nature","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Aristotle.jpg/220px-Aristotle.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Democritus_by_Agostino_Carracci.jpg/220px-Democritus_by_Agostino_Carracci.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Francis_Bacon.jpg/220px-Francis_Bacon.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Thomas_Hobbes_%28portrait%29.jpg/220px-Thomas_Hobbes_%28portrait%29.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Rousseau.jpg/220px-Rousseau.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Benjamin_west_Death_wolfe_noble_savage.jpg/220px-Benjamin_west_Death_wolfe_noble_savage.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Ambox_scales.svg/40px-Ambox_scales.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["physics","aristotle"],["physics","aristotle#book_ii"],["accident","philosophy"],["motion","physics"],["legalism","chinese_philosophy"]],"members":["accident","motion","legalism","physics"],"related":["Nature","Laws_of_nature","Essences","Causality","Physical_law","Western_Civilization","Philosophy","Metaphysics","Epistemology","Theology","Science","Natural_science","Latin","Birth","Ancient_Greek","Aristotle","Physics_(Aristotle)","Four_causes","Leo_Strauss","Science","Technology","Aristotle","Causality","Material_cause","Efficient_cause","Formal_cause","Final_cause","Nicomachean_Ethics","Metaphysics","Aristotle_Politics","Conventional","Technology","Science","Accident_(philosophy)","Substance_theory","Knowledge","Middle_Ages","Francis_Bacon","Democritus","Mind","Reason","Novum_Organum","Heat","Motion_(physics)","Natural_law","Law_of_physics","Efficient_cause","Formal_cause","Final_cause","Aristotelianism","Grotius","Spirit_of_the_Laws","Thomas_Hobbes","Leviathan","God","Descartes","Clockwork","Natural_science","Machiavelli","The_Prince","General_Wolfe","Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas","Noble_savage","Great_apes","State_of_nature","Rousseau","Second_Discourse","Human_nature","Rationality","Language","Immanuel_Kant","Nietzsche","Richard_Rorty","Daoism","Heraclitus","Logos","Confucianism","Mencius","Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)","Metaphysics","Buddhism","Mandate_of_heaven","Solar_eclipse","A_priori_and_a_posteriori","Aristotelianism","Causality","Empiricism","Human_nature","Idealism","Natural_philosophy","Nature","Platonism","Reality","Truth"]}
