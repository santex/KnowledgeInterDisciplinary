In particular, a concern of philosophy is as to the scope of\nphysical theory, and whether, for example, all events are ultimately physical\nevents, a discussion closely related to the topic of causal closure.\n\nIn science, such reduction is generally desirable, because it explains why and\nhow the thing which is being reduced exists, and because it promotes conceptual\nand theoretical economy. Reducing chemical properties to properties of atoms\nthus explains these properties and integrates them into a single explanatory\nframework, that of atomic structure. For example, we say that physical\nproperties such as the boiling point of a substance are reducible to that\nsubstanceâs molecular properties, because statistical mechanics explain why a\nliquid boils at a certain temperature using only the properties of its\nconstituent atoms. Thus we might also describe reduction as a process analogous\nto , by which one theory (or concept, or property, and so on) is wholly subsumed\nunder another.\n\nReductionism can be divided into three general areas â methodological,\ntheoretical, and ontological â and reduction (the process) into two â\ntheoretical and ontological.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Reduction_(philosophy)","recorded":1362891047,"links":15,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in metaphysics","Metaphysics of mind","Ontology","Reductionism|","Philosophical methodology","Metaphysics of science"],"headings":["Types of reductionism","Types of reduction","Benefits of reduction","Examples","See also","Source"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Philosophy","Causal_closure","Science","Physics","Boiling_point","Molecule","Statistical_mechanics","Reductionism","Ontology","Theory_of_everything","Metaphysics","Monism","Dualism","Johannes_Kepler","Planets","Galileo_Galilei","Newtonian_mechanics","Vitalism","Ontological_primitive","Ontology","Ockham's_razor","Lightning","Molecules","Metaphysics","Bundle_theory","Greedy_reductionism","Reductionism","Special_sciences"]}
