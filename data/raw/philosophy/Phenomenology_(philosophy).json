{"cursor":"37289","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Phenomenology' (from Greek: phainÃ³menon \"that which appears\"; and lÃ³gos\n\"study\") is the philosophical study of the structures of subjective experience\nand consciousness. As a philosophical movement it was founded in the early years\nof the 20th century by Edmund Husserl and was later expanded upon by a circle of\nhis followers at the universities of GÃ¶ttingen and Munich in Germany. It then\nspread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far\nremoved from Husserl's early work. {{citation\n|first=Dan |last=Zahavi |author-link = Dan Zahavi |title=Husserl's Phenomenology\n|publisher=Stanford University Press |place= Stanford |year=2003 }}\n\nPhenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the\nsystematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the\nphenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. This phenomenological ontology\ncan be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees\nthe world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon\none another.\n\nHusserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only\nby himself but also by students such as Edith Stein, by existentialists, such as\nMax Scheler, Nicolai Hartmann, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and by\nother philosophers, such as Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel LÃ©vinas, and sociologists\nAlfred SchÃ¼tz and Eric Voegelin.\n","linknr":856,"url":"Phenomenology_(philosophy)","recorded":1362373681,"links":65,"instances":["knowledge","philosophy","philosophy","philosophy","psychology","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["20th-century
