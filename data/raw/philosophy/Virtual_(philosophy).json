{"cursor":"6400","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Gilles Deleuze uses the term virtual to refer to an aspect of reality that is\nideal, but which is nonetheless real. An example of this would be the meaning,\nor sense, of a proposition, which is not a material aspect of that proposition\n(whether it be written or spoken) but is nonetheless an attribute of that\nproposition. Deleuze's continental philosophy concept of the virtual has two\naspects: first, we could say that the virtual is a kind of surface effect\nproduced by the actual causal interactions which occur at the material level.\nWhen one uses a computer, an image is projected on the monitor screen which\ndepends upon physical interactions going on at the level of hardware. The window\nis nowhere in actuality, but is nonetheless real and can be interacted with.\nThis example actually leads to the other aspect of the virtual which Deleuze\ninsists upon, which is its generative nature. The virtual is here conceived as a\nkind of potentiality that becomes fulfilled in the actual. It is still not\nmaterial, but it is real. The difficulty of how these two aspects of Deleuze's\nnotion of the virtual hang together forms the crux of Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek's argument in\nhis Organs without Bodies, in which he claims that Deleuze backs away from this\nproblem by forming a partnership with FÃ©lix Guattari. Deleuze argues that Henri\nBergson developed \"the notion of the virtual to its highest degree\" and that he\nbased his entire philosophy on it. Deleuze (1966, 43). In\n[[Bergsonism]], Deleuze writes that \"virtual\" is not opposed to \"real\" but\nopposed to \"actual,\" whereas \"real\" is opposed to \"possible.\" Deleuze (1966,\n96-98). This definition, which is almost indistinguishable from potential,\noriginates in medieval Scholastics and the pseudo-Latin \"virtualis\". Deleuze\nidentifies the virtual, considered as a continuous multiplicity, with Bergson's\n\"duration\": \"it is the virtual insofar as it is actualized, in the course of\nbeing actualized, it is inseparable from the movement of its\nactualization.\" Deleuze (1966, 42-43, 81) and Deleuze (2002a, 44).\n\nRecently this conception of the virtual has been challenged and another core\nmeaning has been elicited by (Denis Berthier, \"Meditations on the real and the\nvirtual\" â in French), based on uses in science (virtual image), technology\n(virtual world), and etymology (derivation from virtue â Latin\nvirtus http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virtual ). At the same\nontological level as \"the possible (ie. ideally-possible abstractions,\nrepresentations, or imagined \"fictions,\" the actually-real \"material,\" or the\nactually-possible \"probable\", the \"virtual\" is \"ideal-real\". It is defined as\nthat which is not real, but displays the full qualities of the real â in a\nplainly actual (i.e., not potential) â way. The prototypical case is a\nreflection in a mirror: it is already there, whether or not one can see it; it\nis not waiting for any kind of actualization. This definition allows one to\nunderstand that real effects may be issued from a virtual object, so that our\nperception of it and our whole relation to it, are fully real, even if it is\nnot. This explains how virtual reality is able to be used to cure phobias. Brian\nMassumi shows the political implications of this.\n\nHowever, note that the writers above all use terms such as \"possible\",\n\"potential\" and \"real\" in different ways and relate the virtual to these other\nterms differently. Deleuze regards the opposite of the virtual as the actual.\nRob Shields argues that the opposite of the virtual is the material for there\nare other actualities such as a probability (e.g. \"risks\" are actual dangers\nthat have not yet materialized but there is a \"probability\" that they\nwill). Shields, Rob The Virtual Routledge 2003.\n\nThe virtual is far more than a technical or communications term. Martin Luther\nwas prosecuted by the Catholic Inquisition for the heresy of virtualism after he\nproposed that the Christian Eucharist was not actually but virtually the body\nand blood of Christ.\n\nBoth Bergson and Deleuze build their conception of the virtual in reference to a\nquotation in which Marcel Proust defines a virtuality, memory as \"real but not\nactual, ideal but not abstract\". A dictionary definition written by Charles\nSanders Peirce gives striking support to this understanding of the virtual as\nsomething that is \"as if\" it was actually-real and the everyday usage of the\nterm to indicate what is \"virtually\" so, but not so in fact. Peirce, C.S.\n\"Virtual.\" Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, ed. James Mark Baldwin.
