{"cursor":"9955","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In nuclear engineering, the 'void coefficient' (more properly called '\"void\ncoefficient of reactivity\"') is a number that can be used to estimate how much\nthe reactivity of a nuclear reactor changes as voids (typically steam bubbles)\nform in the reactor moderator or coolant. Reactivity, in the nuclear engineering\nsense (not to be confused with chemical reactivity), measures the degree of\nchange in neutron multiplication in a reactor core. Reactivity is directly\nrelated to the tendency of the reactor core to change power level: if reactivity\nis positive, the core power tends to increase; if it is negative, the core power\ntends to decrease; if it is zero, the core power tends to remain stable. The\nreactivity of the core may be adjusted by the reactor control system in order to\nobtain a desired power level change (or to keep the same power level). It can be\ncompared to the reaction of an automobile as conditions around it change (for\ninstance, wind intensity and direction or road slope), and therefore the\ncorresponding counter-measure that the driver applies to maintain road speed or\nexecute a desired manoeuvre.\n\nReactivity is affected by many factors, including coolant/moderator temperature\nand density, fuel temperature and density, and structural temperature and\ndensity. Net reactivity in a reactor is the sum total of all these\ncontributions, of which the void coefficient is but one. Reactors in which\neither the moderator or the coolant is a liquid typically will have a void\ncoefficient value that is either negative (if the reactor is under-moderated) or\npositive (if the reactor is over-moderated). Reactors in which neither the\nmoderator nor the coolant is a liquid (e.g., a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled\nreactor) will have a void coefficient value equal to zero.\n","linknr":142,"url":"Void_coefficient","recorded":1362372091,"links":21,"instances":["element","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.inl.gov/technicalpublications/Documents/3310868.pdf","http://canteach.candu.org/library/19910101.pdf"],"categories":["Nuclear safety"],"headings":["Explanation","Reactor designs","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reactivity","nuclear"],["reactivity","chemistry"],["mercury","element"]],"members":["mercury","reactivity"],"related":["Nuclear_engineering","Reactivity_(nuclear)","Nuclear_reactor","Neutron_moderator","Coolant","Reactivity_(chemistry)","Nuclear_chain_reaction","Temperature","Density","Nuclear_fission","Chain_reaction","Atomic_nucleus","Neutron","Slow_neutron","Fast_neutron","Neutron_moderator","Metal","Sodium","NaK","Lead","Mercury_(element)","Advanced_gas-cooled_reactor","Loss_of_coolant","Positive_feedback","RBMK","Chernobyl_disaster","Pressurized_water_reactor","Boiling_water_reactor","Boiling_water_reactor","Pressurized_water_reactor","CANDU","RBMK","Uranium","Heavy_water","Fast_breeder_reactor","Fast_neutron","Lead","Sodium","Magnox","Advanced_gas-cooled_reactor","Pebble_bed_reactor","Chernobyl_accident","Neutron_moderator","Nuclear_physics","Nuclear_reactor","CANDU"]}
