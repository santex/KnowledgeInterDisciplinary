The first issue came\nout in March 1935. The aim of the journal is, according to the YCL, to cover\n\n all the latest news and views of the YCL, as well as articles\ncovering important international developments, working-class history, culture,\ndifferent campaigns and struggles taking place in Britain and the rest of the\nworld, as well as regular features such as the Back 2 Basics series (Marxist\nconcepts made easy), the Industrial Diary, and Uncle Joe's Book at Bedtime (a\nreview of some classic Marxist\ntexts). [http://www.ycl.org.uk/index.php?file=Challenge Overview of\nChallenge]\n\nThe other \"Challenge\" is the bi-weekly newspaper of the Progressive Labor Party,\na transnational communist party based primarily in the United States (but also\nhaving several smaller branches in various places in Latin and South America,\nand laying claim to several very small cells in other select places around the\nworld). Due to its rather large Spanish language readership, the PLP also\nproduces parallel issues in Spanish (Desafio).\n\nNeither publication is to be confused with the historical ''Challenge'' which\nwas, in its day, a primary publication of the Young People's Socialist League\nback when it was associated with the Socialist Party of America (YPSL is now\npolitically and organisationally separate from the SPA).\n","linknr":123,"url":"Challenge_(Communist_journal)","recorded":1362569605,"links":19,"instances":["usa","1933","britain"],"pdf":[],"categories":["British political magazines","Newspapers published in the United States"],"headings":["See also","External links","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/A_coloured_voting_box.svg/30px-A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Hammernsickleredonwhite.svg/36px-Hammernsickleredonwhite.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Magazine.svg/30px-Magazine.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["young_communist_league","britain"],["young_communist_league","britain"],["progressive_labor_party","usa"],["challenge","1933"],["young_communist_league","britain"]],"members":["progressive_labor_party","challenge","young_communist_league"],"related":["Communist","Magazine","Periodical","Young_Communist_League_(Britain)","Communist_Party_of_Britain","Young_Communist_League_(Britain)","Great_Britain","Joseph_Stalin","Marxism","Newspaper","Progressive_Labor_Party_(USA)","International","Communist_party","United_States","Latin_America","South_America","Spanish_language","Challenge_(1933)","Young_People's_Socialist_League","Socialist_Party_of_America","Communist_Party_of_Britain","Young_Communist_League_(Britain)"]}
