{"cursor":"48469","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n \n\nIn 'passive solar building design', windows, walls, and floors are made to\ncollect, store, and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter\nand reject solar heat in the summer. This is called passive solar design or\nclimatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn't involve\nthe use of mechanical and electrical devices.\n\nThe key to designing a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the\nlocal climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing\ntype, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. Passive solar design\ntechniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings\ncan be adapted or \"retrofitted\".\n","linknr":857,"url":"Orientation_(housing)","recorded":1362554958,"links":34,"instances":["window","architecture","stes","agriculture","meteorology","heat","barrier","physics"],"pdf":["http://greenershelter.org/TokyoPaper.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39678.pdf","http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39678.pdf","http://www.toolbase.org/PDF/CaseStudies/ZEHPrimer.pdf","http://www.toolbase.org/PDF/CaseStudies/ZEHPrimer.pdf"],"categories":["Solar
