Hosted originally by Linda Dano and Nancy Glass, it was\ntaped before a live studio audience at EUE Screen Gems Studios, 222 East 44th\nStreet in New York City. Glass was replaced by singer Dee Kelly following the\nshow's second season, as Glass left to host the nationally syndicated primetime\nmagazine show This Evening. The show then moved to Kaufman Astoria Studios in\nQueens. Dano's co-host later changed once more, with Jerry Penacoli, who is now\nhost of [[Extra (TV series)|Extra]]. The show by this time had evolved into more\nof a tabloid talk format. Dano, uncomfortable with the changes, left the show.\nPenacoli was subsequently fired from the show. Both were replaced with Dorothy\nLucey and Rolonda Watts as the new co-hosts. The show's audience, unable to\naccept the loss of Dano as well as disliking the change in format, quickly\ndropped off and Attitudes was canceled soon after.\n\nAttitudes was the first national talk show hosted by two women and was written\nabout during its tenure in such publications as [[The New York Times]] and\n[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] and parodied on [[Saturday Night Live]]. With its\nfirst hosts, Linda Dano and Nancy Glass, the show was nominated for a Daytime\nEmmy in the category of Outstanding Talk Show but lost to Sally Jessy Raphael's\neponymous [[Sally (TV series)|Sally]]. They were the first cable hosts to be\nnominated in this category.\n\nThe show featured numerous celebrity guests from the worlds of entertainment,\nfashion, and politics. One of the stranger episodes of the show, featuring an\nincredibly flexible 84-year-old woman, Barbara Moseley, [http://findarticle-\ns.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060402/ai_n16206395/ Sunday

footage.\n","linknr":116,"url":"Attitudes_(TV_series)","recorded":1364035820,"links":["/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=edit","//en.wikipedia.org/apple-touch-icon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/favicon/wikipedia.ico","/w/opensearch_desc.php","//en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=rsd","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=atom","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=ext.gadget.DRN-wizard%2CReferenceTooltips%2Ccharinsert%2Cteahouse%7Cext.wikihiero%7Cmediawiki.legacy.commonPrint%2Cshared%7Cmw.PopUpMediaTransform%7Cskins.vector&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=site&only=styles&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/en.wikipedia.org/load.php?debug=false&lang=en&modules=startup&only=scripts&skin=vector&*","//bits.wikimedia.org/geoiplookup","//meta.wikimedia.org","#mw-head","#p-search","/wiki/Talk_show","/wiki/Linda_Dano","/wiki/Nancy_Glass","/wiki/Jerry_Penacoli","/wiki/Dorothy_Lucey","/wiki/Rolonda_Watts","/wiki/English_language","/wiki/Lifetime_(TV_network)","/wiki/Television","/wiki/Talk_show","/wiki/Lifetime_Television","/wiki/Linda_Dano","/wiki/Nancy_Glass","/w/index.php?title=EUE_Screen_Gems&action=edit&redlink=1","/wiki/New_York_City","/wiki/Kaufman_Astoria_Studios","/wiki/Jerry_Penacoli","/wiki/Extra_(TV_series)","/wiki/Dorothy_Lucey","/wiki/Rolonda_Watts","/wiki/The_New_York_Times","/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)","/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live","/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award","/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Talk_Show","/wiki/Sally_Jessy_Raphael","/wiki/Sally_(TV_series)","#cite_note-1","/wiki/Coldplay","/wiki/The_Hardest_Part_(Coldplay_song)","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=1","#cite_ref-1","http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20060402/ai_n16206395/","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=edit&section=2","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335618/","/wiki/Internet_Movie_Database","http://www.tv.com/shows/attitudes/","/wiki/TV.com","/wiki/File:Blank_television_set.svg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Blank_television_set.svg/30px-Blank_television_set.svg.png","/wiki/Talk_show","/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=edit","/wiki/Template:Talk-tv-prog-stub","/wiki/Template_talk:Talk-tv-prog-stub","//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Talk-tv-prog-stub&action=edit","http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&oldid=535289920","/wiki/Help:Categories","/wiki/Category:Lifetime_(TV_network)_shows","/wiki/Category:American_television_talk_shows","/wiki/Category:1980s_American_television_series","/wiki/Category:1990s_American_television_series","/wiki/Category:Television_talk_show_stubs","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Attitudes+%28TV+series%29&type=signup","/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Attitudes+%28TV+series%29","/wiki/Attitudes_(TV_series)","/wiki/Talk:Attitudes_(TV_series)","#","/wiki/Attitudes_(TV_series)","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=edit","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=history","#","/w/index.php","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Main_Page","/wiki/Portal:Contents","/wiki/Portal:Featured_content","/wiki/Portal:Current_events","/wiki/Special:Random","//donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserRedirector?utm_source=donate&utm_medium=sidebar&utm_campaign=C13_en.wikipedia.org&uselang=en","/wiki/Help:Contents","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal","/wiki/Special:RecentChanges","/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Attitudes_(TV_series)","/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Attitudes_(TV_series)","/wiki/Wikipedia:File_Upload_Wizard","/wiki/Special:SpecialPages","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&oldid=535289920","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&action=info","/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Attitudes_%28TV_series%29&id=535289920","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=book_creator&referer=Attitudes+%28TV+series%29","/w/index.php?title=Special:Book&bookcmd=render_article&arttitle=Attitudes+%28TV+series%29&oldid=535289920&writer=rl","/w/index.php?title=Attitudes_(TV_series)&printable=yes","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use","//www.wikimediafoundation.org/","//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us","//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy","/wiki/Wikipedia:About","/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer","http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitudes_(TV_series)","//wikimediafoundation.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//www.mediawiki.org/","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf11
