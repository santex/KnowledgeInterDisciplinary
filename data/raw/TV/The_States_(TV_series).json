The show begins with an\nintroduction to the five states to be documented within the episode. Each\nstate's segment begins with the narrator giving a clue as to what that state\nmight be, and then revealing the answer. ( i.e. \"There is a North Dakota and a\nSouth Dakota, a North Carolina and a South Carolina, but there's been one \"West\"\nanything! Welcome to West Virginia.\") There is then a billboard that pops up\nshowing the state nickname, motto, population, population ranking within the\nunion, date the state entered the union, and state flag. During interviews with\nhistorians or notable people from a state, the state's quarter is shown. Since\nthe series was produced in 2007, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, and\nHawaii are shown with their flags. Those quarters were released in 2008\n\nThe show then highlights the history of the state itself, including notable\nevents that have happened there, and highlights other noteworthy things in that\nstate. In 2010 a sister presentation and then series, [[How the States Got Their\nShapes]] was aired.\n","linknr":214,"url":"The_States_(TV_series)","recorded":1362477381,"links":13,"instances":["producer","tv_channel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["History (TV channel) original programs"],"headings":["Episode list","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/22px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["robert_hughes","producer"],["history","u.s._tv_channel"],["list_of_programs_broadcast_by_history","tv_channel"],["history","u.s._tv_channel"]],"members":["history","robert_hughes","list_of_programs_broadcast_by_history"],"related":["History","Documentary_film","Nicholas_Stoin","Robert_Hughes_(producer)","Edward_Herrmann","History_(U.S._TV_channel)","2007_in_television","United_States","Documentary_film","Television_series","United_States","Edward_Herrmann","Oklahoma","New_Mexico","Arizona","Alaska","Hawaii","List_of_programs_broadcast_by_History_(TV_channel)","History_(U.S._TV_channel)"]}
