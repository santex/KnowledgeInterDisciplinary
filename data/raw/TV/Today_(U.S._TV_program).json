The program debuted on January 14, 1952. It was the first of its\ngenre on American television and in the world, and is now the fifth-longest\nrunning American television series. Originally a two-hour program on weekdays,\nit expanded to Sundays (currently one hour) in 1987 and Saturdays (two hours)\nin 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four\nhours in 2007.\n\nToday's dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the\nlate 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC's [[Good Morning America]]. Today\nretook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto\nthat position for 852 consecutive weeks.\n\nThe two main hours of the show alone generate hundreds of millions of dollars in\nad revenue for NBC. In 2002, Today was ranked #17 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV\nShows of All Time.\n","linknr":936,"url":"Today_(U.S._TV_program)","recorded":1362584322,"links":51,"instances":["philippines","tv_series","journalist","meteorologist","manhattan","journalist","tv_journalist","journalist","bandleader","tv_program","journalism"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1952
