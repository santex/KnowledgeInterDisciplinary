{"cursor":"40199","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Environmental protection' is a practice of protecting the natural environment\non individual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of the\nnatural environment and humans. Due to the pressures of population and\ntechnology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes\npermanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing\nrestraints on activities that cause environmental degradation. Since the 1960's,\nactivity of environmental movements has created awareness of the various\nenvironmental issues. There is no agreement on the extent of the environmental\nimpact of human activity, and protection measures are occasionally criticized.\n\nAcademic institutions now offer courses, such as environmental studies,\nenvironmental management and environmental engineering, that teach the history\nand methods of environment protection. Protection of the environment is needed\ndue to various human activities. Waste production, air pollution, and loss of\nbiodiversity (resulting from the introduction of invasive species and species\nextinction) are some of the issues related to environmental protection.\n\nEnvironmental protection is influenced by three interwoven factors:\nenvironmental legislation, ethics and education. Each of these factors plays its\npart in influencing national-level environmental decisions and personal-level\nenvironmental values and behaviors. For environmental protection to become a\nreality, it is important for societies to develop each of these areas that,\ntogether, will inform and drive environmental decisions. Solomon, U., A\ndetailed look at the three disciplines, environmental ethics, law and education\nto determine which plays the most critical role in environmental enhancement and\nprotection.
