During the voyage Svartman alights on a barren skerry, and\ndiscovers a young woman there, Sara. Despite her feral nature, something about\nher strikes him to his core and, even when he has returned to Stockholm and his\nwife Kristina, he finds himself compelled to go back to the island.\n\nEver since his childhood Svartman has been obsessed by exactness in the\nmeasurement of time or distance. He seeks solace through secretly observing or\nfollowing people, and at night overcomes fear by cradling his most precious\npossession, his sounding lead. Svartman's obsessions and growing distrust of\nothers leads him to submerge himself in a web of deceit involving his employer,\nKristina and Sara which increasingly threatens to engulf him.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Depths_(novel)","recorded":1362562887,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["2004 novels","Novels by Henning Mankell","Novels set in Sweden"],"headings":[],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01b.svg/40px-Books-aj.svg_aj_ashton_01b.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Laurie_Thompson","Henning_Mankell","Sweden","Swedish_language","Genre_fiction","Random_House","Hardcover","Paperback","Henning_Mankell","Naval_engineer","Swedish_navy","Sounding_line"]}
