Rabies transmission can occur through the saliva of animals.\n\nThe rabies virus has a cylindrical morphology and is the type species of the\n[[Lyssavirus]] genus of the [[Rhabdoviridae]] family. These viruses are\nenveloped and have a single stranded RNA genome with negative-sense. The genetic\ninformation is packaged as a ribonucleoprotein complex in which RNA is tightly\nbound by the viral nucleoprotein. The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes\nwhose order is highly conserved. These genes code for nucleoprotein (N),\nphosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the viral RNA\npolymerase (L).\n\nAll transcription and replication events take place in the cytoplasm inside a\nspecialized âvirus factoryâ, the [[Negri bodies|Negri body]] (named after\nAdelchi Negri ). These are 2â10 Âµm in diameter and are typical for a\nrabies infection and thus have been used as definite histological proof of such\ninfection.\n","linknr":368,"url":"Rabies_virus","recorded":1362672739,"links":35,"instances":["genetics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Rabies|virus","Mononegavirales"],"headings":["Structure","Life cycle","Infection","Antigenicity","Evolution","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Rabies_Virus_EM_PHIL_1876.JPG/220px-Rabies_Virus_EM_PHIL_1876.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flu_und_legende_color_c.jpg/138px-Flu_und_legende_color_c.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["transcription"],"related":["Micrograph","Virion","Pathognomonic","Neurotropic_virus","Rabies_transmission","Type_species","Genus","Viral_envelope","RNA","Negative-sense","Ribonucleoprotein","Adelchi_Negri","Micrometre","Pathognomonic","Helical","Regular_polyhedron","Nanometer","Lipoprotein","Glycoprotein","Invaginated","Ribonucleoprotein","Endosome","PH","Cytosol","Transcription_(genetics)","Ribonucleoprotein","Cis-regulatory_element","Ribonucleoprotein","Poupe_Charles_Jones","Trinidad","West_Indies","Negri_bodies","Vampire_bats","Peripheral_nervous_system","Axoplasmic_transport","Dynein","DYNLL1","Interferon","Immune","Natural_reservoir","Yellow_Mongoose","Extreme_weather_events_of_535–536","Krakatoa"]}
