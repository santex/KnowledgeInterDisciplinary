First it uses its\nown reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome, reverse of\nthe usual pattern, thus retro (backwards). This new DNA is then incorporated\ninto the host's genome by an integrase enzyme. The cell then treats the viral\nDNA as part of its own instructions, which it follows blindly, making the\nproteins required to assemble new copies of the virus. Retroviruses are\nenveloped viruses that belong to the viral family Retroviridae.\n\nA special variant of retroviruses are endogenous retroviruses which are\nintegrated into the genome of the host and inherited across generations.\n\nThe virus itself stores its nucleic acid in the form of a +mRNA (including the\n5'cap and 3'PolyA inside the virion) genome and serves as a means of delivery of\nthat genome into cells it targets as an obligate parasite, and constitutes the\ninfection. Once in the host's cell, the RNA strands undergo reverse\ntranscription in the cytoplasm and are integrated into the host's genome, at\nwhich point the retroviral DNA is referred to as a provirus. It is difficult to\ndetect the virus until it has infected the host.\n\nIn most viruses, DNA is transcribed into RNA, and then RNA is translated into\nprotein. However, retroviruses function differently â their RNA is reverse-\ntranscribed into DNA, which is integrated into the host cell's genome (when it\nbecomes a provirus), and then undergoes the usual transcription and\ntranslational processes to express the genes carried by the virus. So, the\ninformation contained in a retroviral gene is used to generate the corresponding\nprotein via the sequence: RNA â DNA â RNA â protein. This extends the\nfundamental process identified by Francis Crick, in which the sequence is: DNA â\nRNA â protein.\n\nRetroviruses are proving to be valuable research tools in molecular biology and\nhave been used successfully in gene delivery systems.\n","linknr":572,"url":"Reverse_transcribing_virus","recorded":1362374381,"links":95,"instances":["gene","biology","genetics","genetics","biology","molecular_biology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Molecular biology","Retroviruses|*"],"headings":["Structure","Multiplication","Transmission","Genes","Provirus","Early evolution","Gene therapy","Cancer","Classification","Treatment","Treatment of veterinary retroviruses","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Hiv_gross.png/220px-Hiv_gross.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Phylogeny_of_Retroviruses.jpg/350px-Phylogeny_of_Retroviruses.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["cell","biology"],["transcription","genetics"],["translation","genetics"],["transcription","genetics"],["proofreading","biology"],["vector","molecular_biology"],["src","gene"],["transcription","genetics"]],"members":["src","proofreading","translation","transcription","cell","vector"],"related":["RNA_virus","Reverse_transcriptase","DNA","RNA","Retroviral_integration","Genome","Integrase","Enveloped_virus","Endogenous_retrovirus","MRNA","Cell_(biology)","Obligate_parasite","Infection","Reverse_transcription","Cytoplasm","Provirus","Transcription_(genetics)","Translation_(genetics)","Protein","Provirus","Francis_Crick","Virions","RNA","Kilobases","Viral_envelope","Plasma_membrane","RNA","Gene_expression","Reverse_transcription","Reverse_transcription","Transcription_(genetics)","Proteins","Protease","Capsid","Germline","Inheritance","Endogenous_retrovirus","Exogenous_DNA","Junk_DNA","Placenta","Germination","Embryo","Immunology","Autoimmune_disease","Multiple_sclerosis","Reverse_transcriptase","Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology","Eukaryote","Retrotransposon","Capsid","Reverse_transcriptase_inhibitor","Proofreading_(biology)","Mutate","Immunology","Vaccines","Lentivirus","Jaagsiekte_sheep_retrovirus","Open_reading_frames","Protein","Reverse_transcriptase","Protease","Integrase","Oncogene","Eukaryote","Prokaryote","RNA_world_hypothesis","DNA","RNA","Gammaretrovirus","Lentiviral","Vector_(molecular_biology)","Gene_therapy","Src_(gene)","Oncovirus","Reverse_transcriptase","Pseudoviridae","Transcription_(genetics)","Reverse_transcriptase","Antiretroviral_drugs","HIV","HIV","Biological_life_cycle","Feline_Leukemia_Virus","Feline_immunodeficiency_virus","Biologic_medical_product","Lymphocyte_T-Cell_Immune_Modulator"]}
