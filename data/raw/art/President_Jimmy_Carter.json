Before he became President, Carter, a Democrat, served as\na U.S. Naval officer, was a peanut farmer, served two terms as a Georgia State\nSenator and one as Governor of Georgia (1971â1975).\n\nDuring Carter's term as President, he created two new cabinet-level departments:\nthe Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He established a\nnational energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new\ntechnology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the Camp David Accords, the\nPanama Canal Treaties, the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT\nII), and returned the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. He took office during a\nperiod of international stagflation, which persisted throughout his term. The\nend of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979â1981 Iran hostage crisis,\nthe 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, the Soviet\ninvasion of Afghanistan, the United States boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics\nin Moscow (the only U.S. boycott in Olympic history), and the eruption of Mount\nSt. Helens in Washington state.\n\nBy 1980, Carter's popularity had eroded. He survived a primary challenge against\nTed Kennedy for the Democratic Party nomination in the 1980 election, but lost\nthe election to Ronald Reagan, the Republican candidate. On January 20, 1981,\nminutes after Carter's term in office ended, the 52 U.S. captives held at the\nU.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day Iran hostage\ncrisis.\n\nAfter leaving office, Carter and his wife Rosalynn founded the Carter Center in\n1982, \"[http://www.cartercenter.org/about/history/chronology.html Timeline\nand History of The Carter Center]\". The Carter Center. Retrieved February 16,\n2010. a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization that works to advance\nhuman rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, observe\nelections, and advance disease prevention and eradication in developing nations.\nCarter is a key figure in the Habitat for Humanity project, and also remains particularly vocal on the\nIsraeliâPalestinian conflict.\n","linknr":2870,"url":"President_Jimmy_Carter","recorded":1362499993,"links":200,"instances":["canadian_tv_series","politician","belgium","hai_duong","usa","united_states","connecticut","senator","politician","state","navy","nbc_program","title","armed_forces"],"pdf":["http://www.californiasar.org/images/SpringCompatriot07_R.pdf","http://www.californiasar.org/images/SpringCompatriot07_R.pdf","http://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf","http://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf","http://cartercenter.org/documents/1053.pdf","http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/2020.pdf"],"categories":["Jimmy
