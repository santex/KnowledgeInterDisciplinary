It\nwas signed at the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center in San\nFrancisco, United States, on 26 June 1945, by 50 of the 51 original member\ncountries (Poland, the other original member, which was not represented at the\nconference, signed it two months later). It entered into force on 24 October\n1945, after being ratified by the five permanent members of the Security\nCouncilâthe Republic of China (later replaced by the People's Republic of\nChina), France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (later replaced by the\nRussian Federation), the United Kingdom, and the United Statesâand a majority of\nthe other signatories. Today, 193 countries are members of the United Nations.\n\nAs a charter, it is a constituent treaty, and all members are bound by its\narticles. Furthermore, the Charter states that obligations to the United Nations\nprevail over all other treaty obligations. Most countries in\nthe world have now ratified the Charter. One notable exception is the Vatican\nCity State, which has chosen to remain a permanent observer state and therefore\nis not a full signatory to the\nCharter.
