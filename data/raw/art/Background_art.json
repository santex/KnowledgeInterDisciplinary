{"cursor":"13353","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Prior art' (also known as '[[state of the art]]', which also has other\nmeanings, or 'background art' \"The expression 'background art' ... must have\nthe same meaning as the more familiar expression 'prior art'\" in [http://legal.european-patent-\noffice.org/dg3/biblio/t820011ep1.htm EPO Board of appeal decision T 11/82 of 15\nApril 1983], Headnote II and Reasons 15. ), in most systems of patent\nlaw, See for example and  constitutes all information that has been\nmade available to the public in any form before a given date that might be\nrelevant to a patent's claims of originality. If an invention has been described\nin the prior art, a patent on that invention is not valid.\n\nInformation kept secret, for instance, as a trade secret, is not usually prior\nart, provided that employees and others with access to the information are under\na non-disclosure obligation. With such an obligation, the information is\ntypically not regarded as prior art. Therefore, a patent may be granted on an\ninvention, although someone else already knew of the invention. A person who\nused an invention in secret may in some jurisdictions be able to claim \"prior\nuser rights\" and thereby gain the right to continue using the invention. As a\nspecial exception, earlier-filed and unpublished patent applications do qualify\nas prior art as of their filing date in certain circumstances.\n\nIn order to anticipate a claim, prior art is generally expected to provide a\ndescription sufficient to inform an average worker in the field (or the [[person\nskilled in the art]]) of some subject matter falling within the scope of the\nclaim. Prior art must be available in some way to the public, and in many\ncountries, the information needs to be recorded in a fixed form somehow. Prior\nart generally does not include unpublished work or mere conversations (though\naccording to the European Patent Convention, oral disclosures also form prior\nartâsee ). It is disputed whether traditional knowledge (e.g., of medical\nproperties of a certain plant) constitutes prior art.\n\nPatents disclose to society how an invention is practiced, in return for the\nright (during a limited term) to exclude others from manufacturing, selling,\noffering for sale or using the patented invention without the patentee's\npermission. Patent offices deal with prior art searches in the context of the\npatent granting procedure.\n","linknr":251,"url":"Background_art","recorded":1362898539,"links":18,"instances":["united_kingdom_patent_law"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20110720100618/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/pdfs/news/ON20071018%20Patents%20Amendments%20Regulations.pdf","http://www.uspto.gov/about/vendor_info/current.../ocio-6013-09q.pdf"],"categories":["Patent law"],"headings":["Usage in litigation","Types of prior art searches","Duty of disclosure","Public participation in patent examination","See also","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["non-binding_opinion","united_kingdom_patent_law"]],"members":[],"related":["Patent","Information","Invention","Trade_secret","Patent_application","European_Patent_Convention","Traditional_knowledge","Medical","Graham_v._John_Deere_Co.","Patent_attorney","Patent_application","Utility_model","Scientific_literature","Patent_examiner","Manual_of_Patent_Examining_Procedure","Patent_infringement","Crowdsourcing","Clearance_search_and_opinion","United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","Patent_examiner","Inequitable_conduct","Japan","Australia","Internet","Wiki","Wikipedia","Defensive_publication","Illegal_number","Illegal_prime","Information_disclosure_statement","Internet_as_a_source_of_prior_art","Micropatent","Non-binding_opinion_(United_Kingdom_patent_law)","Patent_classification","Patent_watch","Priority_right","Public_participation_in_patent_examination","Search_report","Espacenet","European_Patent_Organisation","Google_Patents","Google","United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","World_Intellectual_Property_Organization","United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office","European_Patent_Office"]}
