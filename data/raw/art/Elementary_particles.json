{"cursor":"26444","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn particle physics, an 'elementary particle' or 'fundamental particle' is a not\nknown to have any substructure, thus it is not known to be made up of\nsmaller particles. If an elementary particle truly has no substructure, then it\nis one of the basic building blocks of the universe from which all other\nparticles are made. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the elementary\nparticles include the fundamental fermions (including quarks, leptons, and their\nantiparticles), and the fundamental bosons (including gauge bosons and the Higgs\nboson).  Although elementary particles are not made up of\nsmaller particles, some of them may change to lighter particles (according to\nspecific rules).\n\nHistorically, the hadrons (mesons and baryons such as the proton and neutron)\nand even whole atoms were once regarded as elementary particles (indeed, the\nword \"atom\" means \"that which cannot be cut\" from the greek word atomos). A\ncentral feature in elementary particle theory is the early 20th century idea of\n\"quanta\", which revolutionized the understanding of electromagnetic radiation\nand brought about quantum mechanics. For mathematical purposes, elementary\nparticles are normally treated as point particles, although some particle\ntheories, such as string theory, posit that elementary particles have a finite\nnonzero size.\n","linknr":644,"url":"Elementary_particles","recorded":1362892169,"links":91,"instances":["series","particle_physics","observation","particle","physics","particle_physics","particle_physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts
