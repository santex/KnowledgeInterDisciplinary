It is thus distinct from the\nUniformed Branch and the Special Branch.\n\nIn 1854, with an increasing amount of detective work to be done, Nottingham\nBorough Police set up the countyâs first CID section.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service CID, the first such organisation, was set up on\n7 April 1878 by C. E. Howard Vincent. Originally, it was under the direct\ncommand of the Home Secretary, but since 1888 has been under the authority of\nthe Commissioner.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Criminal_Investigation_Department","recorded":1362891655,"links":22,"instances":["ireland","india","underground_society","india","united_kingdom","linguistics","france"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Types of police unit of the United Kingdom","Criminal investigation","Criminology organizations"],"headings":["Organization","Special Investigations Branch","In other countries","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ab/CharlesVincent.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["superintendent","police#united_kingdom"],["territorial_army","united_kingdom"],["triad","underground_society"],["criminal_investigation_department","pakistan"],["criminal_investigation_department","sri_lanka"],["crime_investigation_department","india"],["prefix","linguistics"],["sony_tv","india"],["criminal_investigation_department","ireland"],["national_police","france"]],"members":["criminal_investigation_department","sony_tv","triad","crime_investigation_department","superintendent","territorial_army","prefix","national_police"],"related":["Territorial_police_force","Policing_in_the_United_Kingdom","Commonwealth_of_Nations","Detective","Special_Branch","Metropolitan_Police_Service","C._E._Howard_Vincent","Home_Secretary","Commissioner_of_Police_of_the_Metropolis","Rape","Murder","Assault","Fraud","Detective","United_Kingdom","Police_station","Constable","Sergeant","Inspector","Chief_Inspector","Chief_Superintendent","Special_Branch","British_Armed_Forces","Military_Police","Special_Investigation_Branch","Territorial_Army_(United_Kingdom)","Royal_Malaysian_Police","Triad_(underground_society)","Interpol","Criminal_Investigation_Department_(Pakistan)","Pakistan","Terrorism","Murders","Organized_crime","Sectarianism","Criminal_Investigation_Department_(Sri_Lanka)","Sri_Lanka_Police_Service","Murders","Organized_crime","Singapore_Police_Force","Wing","India","Crime_Investigation_Department_(India)","Law","Crime","Additional_Director_General_of_Police","Commissioner_of_Police","Kerala_Police","Sub-inspector","Prefix_(linguistics)","Detective","Police_rank","United_States","India","Sony_TV_(India)","Criminal_law","Legal_case","District","Counterfeit","Currency","Murder","Judiciary","Court","Government","Uniform","Prostitution","Theft","Bangladesh","CID,_Bangladesh","Dhaka","Criminal_Investigation_Department_(Ireland)","Irish_Free_State","Irish_Civil_War","Police","Germany","Austria","Switzerland","France","National_Police_(France)","Law_enforcement_agency","Organised_crime","Fraud_Squad","Special_Investigation_Branch"]}
