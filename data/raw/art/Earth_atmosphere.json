The atmosphere protects life on Earth by\nabsorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat\nretention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and\nnight (the diurnal temperature variation).\n\nAtmospheric science, or 'aerology', is the overall term for study of Earth's\natmosphere and its processes; early pioneers in the field include LÃ©on\nTeisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.

The atmosphere has a mass of about 5 kg, three quarters of which\nis within about of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with\nincreasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer\nspace. An altitude of is where atmospheric effects become noticeable during\natmospheric reentry of spacecraft. The KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line, at , also is often regarded\nas the boundary between atmosphere and outer space. This altitude amounts to\n1.57% of the Earth's radius.\n\n'Air' is the name given to the atmosphere used in breathing and photosynthesis.\nDry air contains roughly (by volume) 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93%\nargon, 0.039% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also\ncontains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1%. While air\ncontent and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, air suitable for the\nsurvival of terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals is currently only known\nto be found in Earth's troposphere and artificial atmospheres.\n","linknr":738,"url":"Earth_atmosphere","recorded":1362371945,"links":151,"instances":["mathematical_constant","travel","astronomy","lightning","agriculture","optical_phenomenon","element","optics","astronomy"],"pdf":["http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip/overview_ms/control_tseries.pdf","http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip/overview_ms/control_tseries.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf","http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf"],"categories":["Atmospheric
