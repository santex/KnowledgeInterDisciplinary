As an opening batsman,\nhe played 26 Test matches for England and scored six centuries, together with 34\nOne Day International matches with a respectable over 40 average. He is known\nlargely for his feats during the 1986/87 Ashes series where he hit three\ncenturies in consecutive Tests, and for his fiery demeanour at the crease.\n\nBroad's children are both involved in cricket. His son Stuart is an all-rounder\nwho, like his father, represents both England and Nottinghamshire, while his\ndaughter Gemma is a performance analyst with England's One-Day squad. Cricket correspondent Colin Bateman noted, \"Chris Broad pressed\nthe self-destruct button on a career that promised so much. His lack of self-\ncontrol at the crease brought a sad end to his reign as England opener at the\nage of 30, when he should have been enjoying his prime years.\"\n","linknr":327,"url":"Chris_Broad","recorded":1362545180,"links":20,"instances":["cricket","cricket"],"pdf":[],"categories":["1957 births","Living people","Sportspeople from Bristol","England One Day International cricketers","England Test cricketers","English cricketers","Free State cricketers","Gloucestershire cricketers","Nottinghamshire cricketers","Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers","British terrorism victims"],"headings":["Early life and domestic career","International record","Test official","Achievements","The Broad Appeal","Notes","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/Flag_of_Australia.svg/22px-Flag_of_Australia.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg/22px-Flag_of_New_Zealand.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Flag_of_Pakistan.svg/22px-Flag_of_Pakistan.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg/22px-Flag_of_Sri_Lanka.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/WestIndiesCricketFlagPre1999.svg/22px-WestIndiesCricketFlagPre1999.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/50px-Flag_of_England.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["batting_order","cricket#opening_batsmen_or_openers"],["duck","cricket"],["stump","cricket"]],"members":["batting_order","stump","duck"],"related":["Knowle,_Bristol","Panel_of_ICC_Referees","Stuart_Broad","Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club","Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club","Orange_Free_State_cricket_team","Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club","Test_cricket","One-day_International","First-class_cricket","Not_out","List_A_cricket","Knowle,_Bristol","England","Cricket","Opening_batsman","England_cricket_team","One_Day_International","English_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_1986–87","Stuart_Broad","Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club","Knowle,_Bristol","Osteomyelitis","Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club","Orange_Free_State_cricket_team","Test_cricket","English_cricket_team","West_Indian_cricket_team","Lord's_Cricket_Ground","Graeme_Fowler","Duck_(cricket)","Gordon_Greenidge","CricInfo","CricInfo","CricInfo","CricInfo","Sri_Lanka_cricket_team","1986_Ashes_series","Perth","Adelaide","Melbourne","CricInfo","One_Day_International","Australian_cricket_team","Perth","Western_Australia","CricInfo","Mike_Gatting","CricInfo","Stump_(cricket)","Bicentennial_Test","International_Cricket_Council","World_Cricket_Tsunami_Appeal","2009_attack_on_the_Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team","Simon_Taufel","Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club","Orange_Free_State_cricket_team","Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club","England_cricket_team","Australian_cricket_team","Motor_Neurone_Disease","Knowle,_Bristol","England"]}
